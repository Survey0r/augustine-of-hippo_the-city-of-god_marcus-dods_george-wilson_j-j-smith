<p>"Rome having been stormed and sacked by the Goths
under Alaric their king,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the worshippers of false
gods, or pagans, as we commonly call them, made an attempt
to attribute this calamity to the Christian religion, and began
to blaspheme the true God with even more than their wonted
bitterness and acerbity. It was this which kindled my zeal
for the house of God, and prompted me to undertake the
defence of the city of God against the charges and misrepresentations
of its assailants. This work was in my hands
for several years, owing to the interruptions occasioned by
many other affairs which had a prior claim on my attention,
and which I could not defer. However, this great undertaking
was at last completed in twenty-two books. Of these,
the first five refute those who fancy that the polytheistic
worship is necessary in order to secure worldly prosperity,
and that all these overwhelming calamities have befallen us
in consequence of its prohibition. In the following five
books I address myself to those who admit that such calamities
have at all times attended, and will at all times attend,
the human race, and that they constantly recur in forms more
or less disastrous, varying only in the scenes, occasions, and
persons on whom they light, but, while admitting this, maintain
that the worship of the gods is advantageous for the life
to come. In these ten books, then, I refute these two
opinions, which are as groundless as they are antagonistic to
the Christian religion.</p>

<p>"But that no one might have occasion to say, that though
I had refuted the tenets of other men, I had omitted to
establish my own, I devote to this object the second part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
this work, which comprises twelve books, although I have
not scrupled, as occasion offered, either to advance my own
opinions in the first ten books, or to demolish the arguments
of my opponents in the last twelve. Of these twelve books,
the first four contain an account of the origin of these two
cities&mdash;the city of God, and the city of the world. The
second four treat of their history or progress; the third and
last four, of their deserved destinies. And so, though all
these twenty-two books refer to both cities, yet I have
named them after the better city, and called them The City
of God."</p>

<p>Such is the account given by Augustine himself<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the
occasion and plan of this his greatest work. But in addition
to this explicit information, we learn from the correspondence<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of Augustine, that it was due to the importunity of his friend
Marcellinus that this defence of Christianity extended beyond
the limits of a few letters. Shortly before the fall of Rome,
Marcellinus had been sent to Africa by the Emperor Honorius
to arrange a settlement of the differences between the Donatists
and the Catholics. This brought him into contact not
only with Augustine, but with Volusian, the proconsul of
Africa, and a man of rare intelligence and candour. Finding
that Volusian, though as yet a pagan, took an interest in the
Christian religion, Marcellinus set his heart on converting
him to the true faith. The details of the subsequent significant
intercourse between the learned and courtly bishop and
the two imperial statesmen, are unfortunately almost entirely
lost to us; but the impression conveyed by the extant correspondence
is, that Marcellinus was the means of bringing his
two friends into communication with one another. The first
overture was on Augustine's part, in the shape of a simple
and manly request that Volusian would carefully peruse the
Scriptures, accompanied by a frank offer to do his best to
solve any difficulties that might arise in such a course of
inquiry. Volusian accordingly enters into correspondence
with Augustine; and in order to illustrate the kind of difficulties
experienced by men in his position, he gives some
graphic notes of a conversation in which he had recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
taken part at a gathering of some of his friends. The difficulty
to which most weight is attached in this letter, is the
apparent impossibility of believing in the Incarnation. But
a letter which Marcellinus immediately despatched to Augustine,
urging him to reply to Volusian at large, brought the
intelligence that the difficulties and objections to Christianity
were thus limited merely out of a courteous regard to the
preciousness of the bishop's time, and the vast number of his
engagements. This letter, in short, brought out the important
fact, that a removal of speculative doubts would not suffice
for the conversion of such men as Volusian, whose life was
one with the life of the empire. Their difficulties were rather
political, historical, and social. They could not see how the
reception of the Christian rule of life was compatible with
the interests of Rome as the mistress of the world.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And
thus Augustine was led to take a more distinct and wider
view of the whole relation which Christianity bore to the old
state of things,&mdash;moral, political, philosophical, and religious,&mdash;and
was gradually drawn on to undertake the elaborate
work now presented to the English reader, and which may
more appropriately than any other of his writings be called
his masterpiece<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or life-work. It was begun the very year of
Marcellinus' death, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 413, and was issued in detached
portions from time to time, until its completion in the year
426. It thus occupied the maturest years of Augustine's
life&mdash;from his fifty-ninth to his seventy-second year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>From this brief sketch, it will be seen that though the
accompanying work is essentially an Apology, the Apologetic
of Augustine can be no mere rehabilitation of the somewhat
threadbare, if not effete, arguments of Justin and Tertullian.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
In fact, as Augustine considered what was required of him,&mdash;to
expound the Christian faith, and justify it to enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
men; to distinguish it from, and show its superiority to, all
those forms of truth, philosophical or popular, which were
then striving for the mastery, or at least for standing-room;
to set before the world's eye a vision of glory that might win
the regard even of men who were dazzled by the fascinating
splendour of a world-wide empire,&mdash;he recognised that a task
was laid before him to which even his powers might prove
unequal,&mdash;a task certainly which would afford ample scope for
his learning, dialectic, philosophical grasp and acumen, eloquence,
and faculty of exposition.</p>

<p>But it is the occasion of this great Apology which invests
it at once with grandeur and vitality. After more than eleven
hundred years of steady and triumphant progress, Rome had
been taken and sacked. It is difficult for us to appreciate,
impossible to overestimate, the shock which was thus communicated
from centre to circumference of the whole known
world. It was generally believed, not only by the heathen,
but also by many of the most liberal-minded of the Christians,
that the destruction of Rome would be the prelude to the
destruction of the world.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Even Jerome, who might have
been supposed to be embittered against the proud mistress
of the world by her inhospitality to himself, cannot conceal
his profound emotion on hearing of her fall. "A terrible
rumour," he says, "reaches me from the West, telling of Rome
besieged, bought for gold, besieged again, life and property
perishing together. My voice falters, sobs stifle the words I
dictate; for she is a captive, that city which enthralled the
world."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Augustine is never so theatrical as Jerome in the
expression of his feeling, but he is equally explicit in lamenting
the fall of Rome as a great calamity; and while he does
not scruple to ascribe her recent disgrace to the profligate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
manners, the effeminacy, and the pride of her citizens, he is
not without hope that, by a return to the simple, hardy, and
honourable mode of life which characterized the early Romans,
she may still be restored to much of her former prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
But as Augustine contemplates the ruins of Rome's greatness,
and feels, in common with all the world at this crisis, the
instability of the strongest governments, the insufficiency of
the most authoritative statesmanship, there hovers over these
ruins the splendid vision of the city of God "coming down
out of heaven, adorned as a bride for her husband." The old
social system is crumbling away on all sides, but in its place
he seems to see a pure Christendom arising. He sees that
human history and human destiny are not wholly identified
with the history of any earthly power&mdash;not though it be as
cosmopolitan as the empire of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He directs the attention
of men to the fact that there is another kingdom on
earth,&mdash;a city which hath foundations, whose builder and
maker is God. He teaches men to take profounder views of
history, and shows them how from the first the city of God,
or community of God's people, has lived alongside of the
kingdoms of this world and their glory, and has been silently
increasing, "crescit occulto velut arbor ævo." He demonstrates
that the superior morality, the true doctrine, the
heavenly origin of this city, ensure its success; and over
against this, he depicts the silly or contradictory theorizings
of the pagan philosophers, and the unhinged morals of the
people, and puts it to all candid men to say, whether in the
presence of so manifestly sufficient a cause for Rome's downfall,
there is room for imputing it to the spread of Christianity.
He traces the antagonism of these two grand communities
of rational creatures, back to their first divergence
in the fall of the angels, and down to the consummation of all
things in the last judgment and eternal destination of the good
and evil. In other words, the city of God is "the first real
effort to produce a philosophy of history,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to exhibit historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
events in connection with their true causes, and in their real
sequence. This plan of the work is not only a great conception,
but it is accompanied with many practical advantages;
the chief of which is, that it admits, and even requires, a full
treatment of those doctrines of our faith that are more directly
historical,&mdash;the doctrines of creation, the fall, the incarnation,
the connection between the Old and New Testaments, and the
doctrine of "the last things."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The effect produced by this great work it is impossible
to determine with accuracy. Beugnot, with an absoluteness
which we should condemn as presumption in any less competent
authority, declares that its effect can only have been
very slight.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Probably its effect would be silent and slow;
telling first upon cultivated minds, and only indirectly upon
the people. Certainly its effect must have been weakened
by the interrupted manner of its publication. It is an easier
task to estimate its intrinsic value. But on this also patristic
and literary authorities widely differ. Dupin admits that it
is very pleasant reading, owing to the surprising variety of
matters which are introduced to illustrate and forward the
argument, but censures the author for discussing very useless
questions, and for adducing reasons which could satisfy no
one who was not already convinced.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Huet also speaks of
the book as "un amas confus d'excellents materiaux; c'est de
l'or en barre et en lingots."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> L'Abbé Flottes censures these
opinions as unjust, and cites with approbation the unqualified
eulogy of Pressensé.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But probably the popularity of the
book is its best justification. This popularity may be
measured by the circumstance that, between the year 1467
and the end of the fifteenth century, no fewer than twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
editions were called for, that is to say, a fresh edition every
eighteen months.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And in the interesting series of letters
that passed between Ludovicus Vives and Erasmus, who had
engaged him to write a commentary on the <i>City of God</i> for
his edition of Augustine's works, we find Vives pleading for
a separate edition of this work, on the plea that, of all the
writings of Augustine, it was almost the only one read by
patristic students, and might therefore naturally be expected
to have a much wider circulation.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>If it were asked to what this popularity is due, we should
be disposed to attribute it mainly to the great variety of ideas,
opinions, and facts that are here brought before the reader's
mind. Its importance as a contribution to the history of
opinion cannot be overrated. We find in it not only indications
or explicit enouncement of the author's own views upon
almost every important topic which occupied his thoughts,
but also a compendious exhibition of the ideas which most
powerfully influenced the life of that age. It thus becomes,
as Poujoulat says, "comme l'encyclopédie du cinquième siècle."
All that is valuable, together with much indeed that is not so,
in the religion and philosophy of the classical nations of
antiquity, is reviewed. And on some branches of these subjects
it has, in the judgment of one well qualified to judge,
"preserved more than the whole surviving Latin literature."
It is true we are sometimes wearied by the too elaborate
refutation of opinions which to a modern mind seem self-evident
absurdities; but if these opinions were actually prevalent
in the fifth century, the historical inquirer will not
quarrel with the form in which his information is conveyed,
nor will commit the absurdity of attributing to Augustine the
foolishness of these opinions, but rather the credit of exploding
them. That Augustine is a well-informed and impartial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
critic, is evinced by the courteousness and candour which he
uniformly displays to his opponents, by the respect he won
from the heathen themselves, and by his own early life. The
most rigorous criticism has found him at fault regarding
matters of fact only in some very rare instances, which can
be easily accounted for. His learning would not indeed stand
comparison with what is accounted such in our day: his
life was too busy, and too devoted to the poor and to the
spiritually necessitous, to admit of any extraordinary acquisition.
He had access to no literature but the Latin; or at
least he had only sufficient Greek to enable him to refer to
Greek authors on points of importance, and not enough to
enable him to read their writings with ease and pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
But he had a profound knowledge of his own time, and a
familiar acquaintance not only with the Latin poets, but with
many other authors, some of whose writings are now lost to
us, save the fragments preserved through his quotations.</p>

<p>But the interest attaching to the <i>City of God</i> is not merely
historical. It is the earnestness and ability with which he
developes his own philosophical and theological views which
gradually fascinate the reader, and make him see why the
world has set this among the few greatest books of all time.
The fundamental lines of the Augustinian theology are here
laid down in a comprehensive and interesting form. Never
was thought so abstract expressed in language so popular.
He handles metaphysical problems with the unembarrassed
ease of Plato, with all Cicero's accuracy and acuteness, and
more than Cicero's profundity. He is never more at home
than when exposing the incompetency of Neoplatonism, or
demonstrating the harmony of Christian doctrine and true
philosophy. And though there are in the <i>City of God</i>, as
in all ancient books, things that seem to us childish and
barren, there are also the most surprising anticipations of
modern speculation. There is an earnest grappling with
those problems which are continually re-opened because they
underlie man's relation to God and the spiritual world,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
problems which are not peculiar to any one century. As we
read these animated discussions,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fourteen centuries fall away<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Between us and the Afric saint,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And at his side we urge, to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The immemorial quest and old complaint.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">No outward sign to us is given,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">From sea or earth comes no reply;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hushed as the warm Numidian heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He vainly questioned bends our frozen sky."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is true, the style of the book is not all that could be
desired: there are passages which can possess an interest
only to the antiquarian; there are others with nothing to
redeem them but the glow of their eloquence; there are
many repetitions; there is an occasional use of arguments
"plus ingenieux que solides," as M. Saisset says. Augustine's
great admirer, Erasmus, does not scruple to call him a writer
"obscuræ subtilitatis et parum am&#339;næ prolixitatis;"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but
"the toil of penetrating the apparent obscurities will be rewarded
by finding a real wealth of insight and enlightenment."
Some who have read the opening chapters of the <i>City of God</i>,
may have considered it would be a waste of time to proceed;
but no one, we are persuaded, ever regretted reading it all.
The book has its faults; but it effectually introduces us to
the most influential of theologians, and the greatest popular
teacher; to a genius that cannot nod for many lines together;
to a reasoner whose dialectic is more formidable, more keen
and sifting, than that of Socrates or Aquinas; to a saint whose
ardent and genuine devotional feeling bursts up through the
severest argumentation; to a man whose kindliness and wit,
universal sympathies and breadth of intelligence, lend piquancy
and vitality to the most abstract dissertation.</p>

<p>The propriety of publishing a translation of so choice a
specimen of ancient literature needs no defence. As Poujoulat
very sensibly remarks, there are not a great many men
now-a-days who will read a work in Latin of twenty-two
books. Perhaps there are fewer still who ought to do so.
With our busy neighbours in France, this work has been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
prime favourite for 400 years. There may be said to be
eight independent translations of it into the French tongue,
though some of these are <i>in part</i> merely revisions. One of
these translations has gone through as many as four editions.
The most recent is that which forms part of the Nisard series;
but the best, so far as we have seen, is that of the accomplished
Professor of Philosophy in the College of France, Emile Saisset.
This translation is indeed all that can be desired: here and
there an omission occurs, and about one or two renderings a
difference of opinion may exist; but the exceeding felicity
and spirit of the whole show it to have been a labour of
love, the fond homage of a disciple proud of his master. The
preface of M. Saisset is one of the most valuable contributions
ever made to the understanding of Augustine's philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Of English translations there has been an unaccountable
poverty. Only one exists,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and this so exceptionally bad, so
unlike the racy translations of the seventeenth century in
general, so inaccurate, and so frequently unintelligible, that
it is not impossible it may have done something towards
giving the English public a distaste for the book itself. That
the present translation also might be improved, we know;
that many men were fitter for the task, on the score of
scholarship, we are very sensible; but that any one would
have executed it with intenser affection and veneration for
the author, we are not prepared to admit. A few notes have
been added where it appeared to be necessary. Some are
original, some from the Benedictine Augustine, and the rest
from the elaborate commentary of Vives.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="center">PREFACE, EXPLAINING HIS DESIGN IN UNDERTAKING
THIS WORK.</p>


<p>The glorious city of God is my theme in this work, which
you, my dearest son Marcellinus,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> suggested, and which
is due to you by my promise. I have undertaken its defence
against those who prefer their own gods to the Founder of
this city,&mdash;a city surpassingly glorious, whether we view it as it
still lives by faith in this fleeting course of time, and sojourns
as a stranger in the midst of the ungodly, or as it shall dwell
in the fixed stability of its eternal seat, which it now with
patience waits for, expecting until "righteousness shall return
unto judgment,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and it obtain, by virtue of its excellence,
final victory and perfect peace. A great work this, and an
arduous; but God is my helper. For I am aware what
ability is requisite to persuade the proud how great is the
virtue of humility, which raises us, not by a quite human
arrogance, but by a divine grace, above all earthly dignities
that totter on this shifting scene. For the King and Founder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of this city of which we speak, has in Scripture uttered to
His people a dictum of the divine law in these words: "God
resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But
this, which is God's prerogative, the inflated ambition of a
proud spirit also affects, and dearly loves that this be numbered
among its attributes, to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Show pity to the humbled soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And crush the sons of pride."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And therefore, as the plan of this work we have undertaken
requires, and as occasion offers, we must speak also of the
earthly city, which, though it be mistress of the nations, is
itself ruled by its lust of rule.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of the adversaries of the name of Christ, whom the barbarians for Christ's
sake spared when they stormed the city.</i></p>

<p>For to this earthly city belong the enemies against whom
I have to defend the city of God. Many of them, indeed,
being reclaimed from their ungodly error, have become sufficiently
creditable citizens of this city; but many are so inflamed
with hatred against it, and are so ungrateful to its
Redeemer for His signal benefits, as to forget that they would
now be unable to utter a single word to its prejudice, had they
not found in its sacred places, as they fled from the enemy's
steel, that life in which they now boast themselves. Are not
those very Romans, who were spared by the barbarians through
their respect for Christ, become enemies to the name of Christ?
The reliquaries of the martyrs and the churches of the apostles
bear witness to this; for in the sack of the city they were
open sanctuary for all who fled to them, whether Christian
or Pagan. To their very threshold the bloodthirsty enemy
raged; there his murderous fury owned a limit. Thither did
such of the enemy as had any pity convey those to whom
they had given quarter, lest any less mercifully disposed
might fall upon them. And, indeed, when even those murderers
who everywhere else showed themselves pitiless came
to these spots where that was forbidden which the licence of
war permitted in every other place, their furious rage for
slaughter was bridled, and their eagerness to take prisoners
was quenched. Thus escaped multitudes who now reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the Christian religion, and impute to Christ the ills that have
befallen their city; but the preservation of their own life&mdash;a
boon which they owe to the respect entertained for Christ by
the barbarians&mdash;they attribute not to our Christ, but to their
own good luck. They ought rather, had they any right perceptions,
to attribute the severities and hardships inflicted by
their enemies, to that divine providence which is wont to
reform the depraved manners of men by chastisement, and
which exercises with similar afflictions the righteous and
praiseworthy,&mdash;either translating them, when they have passed
through the trial, to a better world, or detaining them still on
earth for ulterior purposes. And they ought to attribute it
to the spirit of these Christian times, that, contrary to the
custom of war, these bloodthirsty barbarians spared them, and
spared them for Christ's sake, whether this mercy was actually
shown in promiscuous places, or in those places specially
dedicated to Christ's name, and of which the very largest
were selected as sanctuaries, that full scope might thus be
given to the expansive compassion which desired that a large
multitude might find shelter there. Therefore ought they to
give God thanks, and with sincere confession flee for refuge to
His name, that so they may escape the punishment of eternal
fire&mdash;they who with lying lips took upon them this name,
that they might escape the punishment of present destruction.
For of those whom you see insolently and shamelessly insulting
the servants of Christ, there are numbers who would not
have escaped that destruction and slaughter had they not pretended
that they themselves were Christ's servants. Yet now,
in ungrateful pride and most impious madness, and at the
risk of being punished in everlasting darkness, they perversely
oppose that name under which they fraudulently protected
themselves for the sake of enjoying the light of this brief
life.</p>

<p>For after this they conquered and destroyed Troy with fire and
sword; after this they beheaded Priam as he fled to the altars.
Neither did Troy perish because it lost Minerva. For what
had Minerva herself first lost, that she should perish? Her
guards perhaps? No doubt; just her guards. For as soon
as they were slain, she could be stolen. It was not, in fact,
the men who were preserved by the image, but the image by
the men. How, then, was she invoked to defend the city and
the citizens, she who could not defend her own defenders?</p>

piteous mistake! And they are enraged at us when we
speak thus about their gods, though, so far from being enraged
at their own writers, they part with money to learn what
they say; and, indeed, the very teachers of these authors are
reckoned worthy of a salary from the public purse, and of
other honours. There is Virgil, who is read by boys, in order
that this great poet, this most famous and approved of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
poets, may impregnate their virgin minds, and may not readily
be forgotten by them, according to that saying of Horace,</p>

<p>Well, in this Virgil, I say, Juno is introduced as hostile to
the Trojans, and stirring up Æolus, the king of the winds,
against them in the words,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>And ought prudent men to have entrusted the defence of
Rome to these conquered gods? But it will be said, this was
only the saying of Juno, who, like an angry woman, did not
know what she was saying. What, then, says Æneas himself,&mdash;Æneas
who is so often designated "pious?" Does he not say,</p>

<p>Is it not clear that the gods (whom he does not scruple to call

<p>If, then, Virgil says that the gods were such as these, and
were conquered, and that when conquered they could not
escape except under the protection of a man, what madness
is it to suppose that Rome had been wisely entrusted to these
guardians, and could not have been taken unless it had lost
them! Indeed, to worship conquered gods as protectors and
champions, what is this but to worship, not good divinities,
but evil omens?<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Would it not be wiser to believe, not that
Rome would never have fallen into so great a calamity had
not they first perished, but rather that they would have
perished long since had not Rome preserved them as long as
she could? For who does not see, when he thinks of it, what
a foolish assumption it is that they could not be vanquished
under vanquished defenders, and that they only perished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
because they had lost their guardian gods, when, indeed, the
only cause of their perishing was that they chose for their
protectors gods condemned to perish? The poets, therefore,
when they composed and sang these things about the conquered
gods, had no intention to invent falsehoods, but uttered,
as honest men, what the truth extorted from them. This,
however, will be carefully and copiously discussed in another
and more fitting place. Meanwhile I will briefly, and to the
best of my ability, explain what I meant to say about these
ungrateful men who blasphemously impute to Christ the calamities
which they deservedly suffer in consequence of their
own wicked ways, while that which is for Christ's sake spared
them in spite of their wickedness they do not even take the
trouble to notice; and in their mad and blasphemous insolence,
they use against His name those very lips wherewith they
falsely claimed that same name that their lives might be
spared. In the places consecrated to Christ, where for His
sake no enemy would injure them, they restrained their tongues
that they might be safe and protected; but no sooner do they
emerge from these sanctuaries, than they unbridle these tongues
to hurl against Him curses full of hate.</p>

<p>Troy itself, the mother of the Roman people, was not able,

</div></div></div>

<p>In other words, the place consecrated to so great a goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
was chosen, not that from it none might be led out a captive,
but that in it all the captives might be immured. Compare
now this "asylum"&mdash;the asylum not of an ordinary god, not
of one of the rank and file of gods, but of Jove's own sister
and wife, the queen of all the gods&mdash;with the churches built
in memory of the apostles. Into it were collected the spoils
rescued from the blazing temples and snatched from the gods,
not that they might be restored to the vanquished, but divided
among the victors; while into these was carried back, with the
most religious observance and respect, everything which belonged
to them, even though found elsewhere. There liberty
was lost; here preserved. There bondage was strict; here
strictly excluded. Into that temple men were driven to become
the chattels of their enemies, now lording it over them;
into these churches men were led by their relenting foes, that
they might be at liberty. In fine, the gentle<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Greeks appropriated
that temple of Juno to the purposes of their own
avarice and pride; while these churches of Christ were chosen
even by the savage barbarians as the fit scenes for humility
and mercy. But perhaps, after all, the Greeks did in that
victory of theirs spare the temples of those gods whom they
worshipped in common with the Trojans, and did not dare to
put to the sword or make captive the wretched and vanquished
Trojans who fled thither; and perhaps Virgil, in the manner
of poets, has depicted what never really happened? But there
is no question that he depicted the usual custom of an enemy
when sacking a city.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Cæsar's statement regarding the universal custom of an enemy when
sacking a city.</i></p>

<p>Even Cæsar himself gives us positive testimony regarding
this custom; for, in his deliverance in the senate about the
conspirators, he says (as Sallust, a historian of distinguished
veracity, writes<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>) "that virgins and boys are violated, children
torn from the embrace of their parents, matrons subjected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
whatever should be the pleasure of the conquerors, temples
and houses plundered, slaughter and burning rife; in fine, all
things filled with arms, corpses, blood, and wailing." If he
had not mentioned temples here, we might suppose that
enemies were in the habit of sparing the dwellings of the gods.
And the Roman temples were in danger of these disasters,
not from foreign foes, but from Catiline and his associates,
the most noble senators and citizens of Rome. But these,
it may be said, were abandoned men, and the parricides of
their fatherland.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That not even the Romans, when they took cities, spared the conquered
in their temples.</i></p>

<p>Why, then, need our argument take note of the many
nations who have waged wars with one another, and have
nowhere spared the conquered in the temples of their gods?
Let us look at the practice of the Romans themselves: let us,
I say, recall and review the Romans, whose chief praise it has
been "to spare the vanquished and subdue the proud," and
that they preferred "rather to forgive than to revenge an injury;"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and among so many and great cities which they have
stormed, taken, and overthrown for the extension of their
dominion, let us be told what temples they were accustomed
to exempt, so that whoever took refuge in them was free. Or
have they really done this, and has the fact been suppressed
by the historians of these events? Is it to be believed,
that men who sought out with the greatest eagerness points
they could praise, would omit those which, in their own
estimation, are the most signal proofs of piety? Marcus
Marcellus, a distinguished Roman, who took Syracuse, a most
splendidly adorned city, is reported to have bewailed its
coming ruin, and to have shed his own tears over it
before he spilt its blood. He took steps also to preserve
the chastity even of his enemy. For before he gave orders
for the storming of the city, he issued an edict forbidding the
violation of any free person. Yet the city was sacked according
to the custom of war; nor do we anywhere read, that even
by so chaste and gentle a commander orders were given that
no one should be injured who had fled to this or that temple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
And this certainly would by no means have been omitted,
when neither his weeping nor his edict preservative of chastity
could be passed in silence. Fabius, the conqueror of the city
of Tarentum, is praised for abstaining from making booty of
the images. For when his secretary proposed the question to
him, what he wished done with the statues of the gods, which
had been taken in large numbers, he veiled his moderation
under a joke. For he asked of what sort they were; and when
they reported to him that there were not only many large
images, but some of them armed, "Oh," says he, "let us leave
with the Tarentines their angry gods." Seeing, then, that the
writers of Roman history could not pass in silence, neither the
weeping of the one general nor the laughing of the other,
neither the chaste pity of the one nor the facetious moderation
of the other, on what occasion would it be omitted, if, for
the honour of any of their enemy's gods, they had shown this
particular form of leniency, that in any temple slaughter or
captivity was prohibited?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>7. <i>That the cruelties which occurred in the sack of Rome were in accordance
with the custom of war, whereas the acts of clemency resulted from the
influence of Christ's name.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>All the spoiling, then, which Rome was exposed to in the
recent calamity&mdash;all the slaughter, plundering, burning, and
misery&mdash;was the result of the custom of war. But what was
novel, was that savage barbarians showed themselves in so
gentle a guise, that the largest churches were chosen and set
apart for the purpose of being filled with the people to whom
quarter was given, and that in them none were slain, from
them none forcibly dragged; that into them many were led
by their relenting enemies to be set at liberty, and that from
them none were led into slavery by merciless foes. Whoever
does not see that this is to be attributed to the name of Christ,
and to the Christian temper, is blind; whoever sees this,
and gives no praise, is ungrateful; whoever hinders any one
from praising it, is mad. Far be it from any prudent man to
impute this clemency to the barbarians. Their fierce and
bloody minds were awed, and bridled, and marvellously tempered
by Him who so long before said by His prophet, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquities
with stripes; nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly
take from them."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of the advantages and disadvantages which often indiscriminately accrue to
good and wicked men.</i></p>

<p>Will some one say, Why, then, was this divine compassion
extended even to the ungodly and ungrateful? Why, but because
it was the mercy of Him who daily "maketh His sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and on the unjust."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> For though some of these men, taking
thought of this, repent of their wickedness and reform, some,
as the apostle says, "despising the riches of His goodness and
long-suffering, after their hardness and impenitent heart, treasure
up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath and
revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render
to every man according to his deeds:"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> nevertheless does the
patience of God still invite the wicked to repentance, even as
the scourge of God educates the good to patience. And so,
too, does the mercy of God embrace the good that it may
cherish them, as the severity of God arrests the wicked to
punish them. To the divine providence it has seemed good to
prepare in the world to come for the righteous good things,
which the unrighteous shall not enjoy; and for the wicked
evil things, by which the good shall not be tormented. But
as for the good things of this life, and its ills, God has willed
that these should be common to both; that we might not too
eagerly covet the things which wicked men are seen equally
to enjoy, nor shrink with an unseemly fear from the ills which
even good men often suffer.</p>

<p>There is, too, a very great difference in the purpose served
both by those events which we call adverse and those called
prosperous. For the good man is neither uplifted with the
good things of time, nor broken by its ills; but the wicked
man, because he is corrupted by this world's happiness, feels
himself punished by its unhappiness.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Yet often, even in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
present distribution of temporal things, does God plainly evince
His own interference. For if every sin were now visited with
manifest punishment, nothing would seem to be reserved for
the final judgment; on the other hand, if no sin received now
a plainly divine punishment, it would be concluded that there
is no divine providence at all. And so of the good things of
this life: if God did not by a very visible liberality confer
these on some of those persons who ask for them, we should
say that these good things were not at His disposal; and if
He gave them to all who sought them, we should suppose that
such were the only rewards of His service; and such a service
would make us not godly, but greedy rather, and covetous.
Wherefore, though good and bad men suffer alike, we must
not suppose that there is no difference between the men themselves,
because there is no difference in what they both suffer.
For even in the likeness of the sufferings, there remains an
unlikeness in the sufferers; and though exposed to the same
anguish, virtue and vice are not the same thing. For as the
same fire causes gold to glow brightly, and chaff to smoke; and
under the same flail the straw is beaten small, while the grain
is cleansed; and as the lees are not mixed with the oil, though
squeezed out of the vat by the same pressure, so the same
violence of affliction proves, purges, clarifies the good, but
damns, ruins, exterminates the wicked. And thus it is that
in the same affliction the wicked detest God and blaspheme,
while the good pray and praise. So material a difference does
it make, not what ills are suffered, but what kind of man
suffers them. For, stirred up with the same movement, mud
exhales a horrible stench, and ointment emits a fragrant odour.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of the reasons for administering correction to bad and good together.</i></p>

<p>What, then, have the Christians suffered in that calamitous
period, which would not profit every one who duly and faithfully
considered the following circumstances? First of all, they
must humbly consider those very sins which have provoked God
to fill the world with such terrible disasters; for although they be
far from the excesses of wicked, immoral, and ungodly men, yet
they do not judge themselves so clean removed from all faults
as to be too good to suffer for these even temporal ills. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
every man, however laudably he lives, yet yields in some points
to the lust of the flesh. Though he do not fall into gross enormity
of wickedness, and abandoned viciousness, and abominable
profanity, yet he slips into some sins, either rarely or so
much the more frequently as the sins seem of less account.
But not to mention this, where can we readily find a man who
holds in fit and just estimation those persons on account of
whose revolting pride, luxury, and avarice, and cursed iniquities
and impiety, God now smites the earth as His predictions
threatened? Where is the man who lives with them in the
style in which it becomes us to live with them? For often
we wickedly blind ourselves to the occasions of teaching and
admonishing them, sometimes even of reprimanding and chiding
them, either because we shrink from the labour or are
ashamed to offend them, or because we fear to lose good friendships,
lest this should stand in the way of our advancement,
or injure us in some worldly matter, which either our covetous
disposition desires to obtain, or our weakness shrinks from
losing. So that, although the conduct of wicked men is distasteful
to the good, and therefore they do not fall with them
into that damnation which in the next life awaits such persons,
yet, because they spare their damnable sins through fear, therefore,
even though their own sins be slight and venial, they are
justly scourged with the wicked in this world, though in eternity
they quite escape punishment. Justly, when God afflicts
them in common with the wicked, do they find this life bitter,
through love of whose sweetness they declined to be bitter to
these sinners.</p>

<p>If any one forbears to reprove and find fault with those
who are doing wrong, because he seeks a more seasonable
opportunity, or because he fears they may be made worse by
his rebuke, or that other weak persons may be disheartened
from endeavouring to lead a good and pious life, and may be
driven from the faith; this man's omission seems to be occasioned
not by covetousness, but by a charitable consideration.
But what is blameworthy is, that they who themselves revolt
from the conduct of the wicked, and live in quite another
fashion, yet spare those faults in other men which they ought
to reprehend and wean them from; and spare them because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
they fear to give offence, lest they should injure their interests
in those things which good men may innocently and legitimately
use,&mdash;though they use them more greedily than becomes
persons who are strangers in this world, and profess the hope
of a heavenly country. For not only the weaker brethren,
who enjoy married life, and have children (or desire to have
them), and own houses and establishments, whom the apostle
addresses in the churches, warning and instructing them how
they should live, both the wives with their husbands, and the
husbands with their wives, the children with their parents,
and parents with their children, and servants with their masters,
and masters with their servants,&mdash;not only do these weaker
brethren gladly obtain and grudgingly lose many earthly and
temporal things on account of which they dare not offend men
whose polluted and wicked life greatly displeases them; but
those also who live at a higher level, who are not entangled in
the meshes of married life, but use meagre food and raiment,
do often take thought of their own safety and good name, and
abstain from finding fault with the wicked, because they fear
their wiles and violence. And although they do not fear them
to such an extent as to be drawn to the commission of like
iniquities, nay, not by any threats or violence soever; yet
those very deeds which they refuse to share in the commission
of, they often decline to find fault with, when possibly they
might by finding fault prevent their commission. They abstain
from interference, because they fear that, if it fail of good effect,
their own safety or reputation may be damaged or destroyed;
not because they see that their preservation and good name
are needful, that they may be able to influence those who need
their instruction, but rather because they weakly relish the
flattery and respect of men, and fear the judgments of the
people, and the pain or death of the body; that is to say,
their non-intervention is the result of selfishness, and not of
love.</p>

<p>Accordingly, this seems to me to be one principal reason
why the good are chastised along with the wicked, when God
is pleased to visit with temporal punishments the profligate
manners of a community. They are punished together, not
because they have spent an equally corrupt life, but because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the good as well as the wicked, though not equally with them,
love this present life; while they ought to hold it cheap, that
the wicked, being admonished and reformed by their example,
might lay hold of life eternal. And if they will not be the
companions of the good in seeking life everlasting, they should
be loved as enemies, and be dealt with patiently. For so long
as they live, it remains uncertain whether they may not come
to a better mind. These selfish persons have more cause to
fear than those to whom it was said through the prophet, "He
is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at
the watchman's hand."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> For watchmen or overseers of the
people are appointed in churches, that they may unsparingly
rebuke sin. Nor is that man guiltless of the sin we speak of,
who, though he be not a watchman, yet sees in the conduct of
those with whom the relationships of this life bring him into
contact, many things that should be blamed, and yet overlooks
them, fearing to give offence, and lose such worldly blessings
as may legitimately be desired, but which he too eagerly
grasps. Then, lastly, there is another reason why the good
are afflicted with temporal calamities&mdash;the reason which Job's
case exemplifies: that the human spirit may be proved, and
that it may be manifested with what fortitude of pious trust,
and with how unmercenary a love, it cleaves to God.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>


<p class="center">10. <i>That the saints lose nothing in losing temporal goods.</i></p>

<p>These are the considerations which one must keep in view,
that he may answer the question whether any evil happens to
the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to profit. Or
shall we say that the question is needless, and that the apostle
is vapouring when he says, "We know that all things work
together for good to them that love God?"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>They lost all they had. Their faith? Their godliness?
The possessions of the hidden man of the heart, which in the
sight of God are of great price?<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Did they lose these? For
these are the wealth of Christians, to whom the wealthy apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
said, "Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought
nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing
out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.
But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a
snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown
men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is
the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they have
erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with
many sorrows."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>They, then, who lost their worldly all in the sack of Rome,
if they owned their possessions as they had been taught by
the apostle, who himself was poor without, but rich within,&mdash;that
is to say, if they used the world as not using it,&mdash;could
say in the words of Job, heavily tried, but not overcome:
"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
as it pleased the Lord, so has it come to pass: blessed be the
name of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Like a good servant, Job counted the
will of his Lord his great possession, by obedience to which
his soul was enriched; nor did it grieve him to lose, while
yet living, those goods which he must shortly leave at his
death. But as to those feebler spirits who, though they
cannot be said to prefer earthly possessions to Christ, do yet
cleave to them with a somewhat immoderate attachment, they
have discovered by the pain of losing these things how much
they were sinning in loving them. For their grief is of their
own making; in the words of the apostle quoted above,
"they have pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
For it was well that they who had so long despised these
verbal admonitions should receive the teaching of experience.
For when the apostle says, "They that will be rich fall into
temptation," and so on, what he blames in riches is not the
possession of them, but the desire of them. For elsewhere he
says, "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be
not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the
living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that
they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute,
willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a good foundation against the time to come, that they
may lay hold on eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> They who were making such
a use of their property have been consoled for light losses by
great gains, and have had more pleasure in those possessions
which they have securely laid past, by freely giving them
away, than grief in those which they entirely lost by an
anxious and selfish hoarding of them. For nothing could
perish on earth save what they would be ashamed to carry
away from earth. Our Lord's injunction runs, "Lay not up
for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay
up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be
also."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And they who have listened to this injunction have
proved in the time of tribulation how well they were advised
in not despising this most trustworthy teacher, and most
faithful and mighty guardian of their treasure. For if many
were glad that their treasure was stored in places which the
enemy chanced not to light upon, how much better founded
was the joy of those who, by the counsel of their God, had
fled with their treasure to a citadel which no enemy can possibly
reach! Thus our Paulinus, bishop of Nola,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> who voluntarily
abandoned vast wealth and became quite poor, though
abundantly rich in holiness, when the barbarians sacked Nola,
and took him prisoner, used silently to pray, as he afterwards
told me, "O Lord, let me not be troubled for gold and silver,
for where all my treasure is Thou knowest." For all his
treasure was where he had been taught to hide and store it
by Him who had also foretold that these calamities would
happen in the world. Consequently those persons who obeyed
their Lord when He warned them where and how to lay up
treasure, did not lose even their earthly possessions in the
invasion of the barbarians; while those who are now repenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
that they did not obey Him have learnt the right use of
earthly goods, if not by the wisdom which would have prevented
their loss, at least by the experience which follows it.</p>

<p>But some good and Christian men have been put to the
torture, that they might be forced to deliver up their goods to
the enemy. They could indeed neither deliver nor lose that
good which made themselves good. If, however, they preferred
torture to the surrender of the mammon of iniquity,
then I say they were not good men. Rather they should
have been reminded that, if they suffered so severely for the
sake of money, they should endure all torment, if need be, for
Christ's sake; that they might be taught to love Him rather
who enriches with eternal felicity all who suffer for Him, and
not silver and gold, for which it was pitiable to suffer, whether
they preserved it by telling a lie, or lost it by telling the truth.
For under these tortures no one lost Christ by confessing Him,
no one preserved wealth save by denying its existence. So
that possibly the torture which taught them that they should
set their affections on a possession they could not lose, was
more useful than those possessions which, without any useful
fruit at all, disquieted and tormented their anxious owners.
But then we are reminded that some were tortured who had
no wealth to surrender, but who were not believed when they
said so. These too, however, had perhaps some craving for
wealth, and were not willingly poor with a holy resignation;
and to such it had to be made plain, that not the actual possession
alone, but also the desire of wealth, deserved such
excruciating pains. And even if they were destitute of any
hidden stores of gold and silver, because they were living
in hopes of a better life,&mdash;I know not indeed if any such
person was tortured on the supposition that he had wealth;
but if so, then certainly in confessing, when put to the question,
a holy poverty, he confessed Christ. And though it was
scarcely to be expected that the barbarians should believe
him, yet no confessor of a holy poverty could be tortured
without receiving a heavenly reward.</p>

<p>Again, they say that the long famine laid many a Christian
low. But this, too, the faithful turned to good uses by a pious
endurance of it. For those whom famine killed outright it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
rescued from the ills of this life, as a kindly disease would
have done; and those who were only hunger-bitten were
taught to live more sparingly, and inured to longer fasts.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the end of this life, whether it is material that it be long delayed.</i></p>

<p>But, it is added, many Christians were slaughtered, and
were put to death in a hideous variety of cruel ways. Well,
if this be hard to bear, it is assuredly the common lot of all
who are born into this life. Of this at least I am certain,
that no one has ever died who was not destined to die some
time. Now the end of life puts the longest life on a par with
the shortest. For of two things which have alike ceased to
be, the one is not better, the other worse&mdash;the one greater, the
other less.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And of what consequence is it what kind of
death puts an end to life, since he who has died once is not
forced to go through the same ordeal a second time? And as
in the daily casualties of life every man is, as it were, threatened
with numberless deaths, so long as it remains uncertain
which of them is his fate, I would ask whether it is not better
to suffer one and die, than to live in fear of all? I am not
unaware of the poor-spirited fear which prompts us to choose
rather to live long in fear of so many deaths, than to die once
and so escape them all; but the weak and cowardly shrinking
of the flesh is one thing, and the well-considered and reasonable
persuasion of the soul quite another. That death is not
to be judged an evil which is the end of a good life; for
death becomes evil only by the retribution which follows it.
They, then, who are destined to die, need not be careful to
inquire what death they are to die, but into what place death
will usher them. And since Christians are well aware that
the death of the godly pauper whose sores the dogs licked
was far better than of the wicked rich man who lay in purple
and fine linen, what harm could these terrific deaths do to
the dead who had lived well?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">12. <i>Of the burial of the dead: that the denial of it to Christians does them no
injury.</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Further still, we are reminded that in such a carnage as
then occurred, the bodies could not even be buried. But
godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance;
for the faithful bear in mind that assurance has been
given that not a hair of their head shall perish, and that,
therefore, though they even be devoured by beasts, their
blessed resurrection will not hereby be hindered. The Truth
would nowise have said, "Fear not them which kill the body,
but are not able to kill the soul,"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> if anything whatever that
an enemy could do to the body of the slain could be detrimental
to the future life. Or will some one perhaps take so
absurd a position as to contend that those who kill the body
are not to be feared before death, and lest they kill the body,
but after death, lest they deprive it of burial? If this be so,
then that is false which Christ says, "Be not afraid of them
that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can
do;"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> for it seems they can do great injury to the dead body.
Far be it from us to suppose that the Truth can be thus false.
They who kill the body are said "to do something," because
the death-blow is felt, the body still having sensation; but
after that, they have no more that they can do, for in the
slain body there is no sensation. And so there are indeed
many bodies of Christians lying unburied; but no one has
separated them from heaven, nor from that earth which is all
filled with the presence of Him who knows whence He will
raise again what He created. It is said, indeed, in the Psalm:
"The dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat
unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the
beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water
round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
But this was said rather to exhibit the cruelty of those who
did these things, than the misery of those who suffered them.
To the eyes of men this appears a harsh and doleful lot, yet
"precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Wherefore all these last offices and ceremonies that concern
the dead, the careful funeral arrangements, and the equipment
of the tomb, and the pomp of obsequies, are rather the solace
of the living than the comfort of the dead. If a costly burial
does any good to a wicked man, a squalid burial, or none at all,
may harm the godly. His crowd of domestics furnished the
purple-clad Dives with a funeral gorgeous in the eye of man;
but in the sight of God that was a more sumptuous funeral
which the ulcerous pauper received at the hands of the angels,
who did not carry him out to a marble tomb, but bore him
aloft to Abraham's bosom.</p>

<p>The men against whom I have undertaken to defend the
city of God laugh at all this. But even their own philosophers<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
have despised a careful burial; and often whole
armies have fought and fallen for their earthly country without
caring to inquire whether they would be left exposed on
the field of battle, or become the food of wild beasts. Of this
noble disregard of sepulture poetry has well said: "He who
has no tomb has the sky for his vault."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> How much less
ought they to insult over the unburied bodies of Christians,
to whom it has been promised that the flesh itself shall be
restored, and the body formed anew, all the members of it
being gathered not only from the earth, but from the most
secret recesses of any other of the elements in which the dead
bodies of men have lain hid!</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Reasons for burying the bodies of the saints.</i></p>

<p>Nevertheless the bodies of the dead are not on this account
to be despised and left unburied; least of all the bodies
of the righteous and faithful, which have been used by the
Holy Ghost as His organs and instruments for all good works.
For if the dress of a father, or his ring, or anything he wore,
be precious to his children, in proportion to the love they
bore him, with how much more reason ought we to care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the bodies of those we love, which they wore far more closely
and intimately than any clothing! For the body is not an
extraneous ornament or aid, but a part of man's very nature.
And therefore to the righteous of ancient times the last offices
were piously rendered, and sepulchres provided for them, and
obsequies celebrated;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and they themselves, while yet alive,
gave commandment to their sons about the burial, and, on
occasion, even about the removal of their bodies to some
favourite place.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And Tobit, according to the angel's testimony,
is commended, and is said to have pleased God by
burying the dead.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Our Lord Himself, too, though He was
to rise again the third day, applauds, and commends to our
applause, the good work of the religious woman who poured
precious ointment over His limbs, and did it against His burial.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
And the Gospel speaks with commendation of those who were
careful to take down His body from the cross, and wrap it
lovingly in costly cerements, and see to its burial.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> These
instances certainly do not prove that corpses have any feeling;
but they show that God's providence extends even to the
bodies of the dead, and that such pious offices are pleasing to
Him, as cherishing faith in the resurrection. And we may
also draw from them this wholesome lesson, that if God does
not forget even any kind office which loving care pays to the
unconscious dead, much more does He reward the charity we
exercise towards the living. Other things, indeed, which the
holy patriarchs said of the burial and removal of their bodies,
they meant to be taken in a prophetic sense; but of these we
need not here speak at large, what we have already said being
sufficient. But if the want of those things which are necessary
for the support of the living, as food and clothing, though
painful and trying, does not break down the fortitude and
virtuous endurance of good men, nor eradicate piety from their
souls, but rather renders it more fruitful, how much less can
the absence of the funeral, and of the other customary attentions
paid to the dead, render those wretched who are already
reposing in the hidden abodes of the blessed! Consequently,
though in the sack of Rome and of other towns the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
bodies of the Christians were deprived of these last offices,
this is neither the fault of the living, for they could not render
them; nor an infliction to the dead, for they cannot feel the
loss.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the captivity of the saints, and that divine consolation never failed them
therein.</i></p>

<p>But, say they, many Christians were even led away captive.
This indeed were a most pitiable fate, if they could be
led away to any place where they could not find their God.
But for this calamity also sacred Scripture affords great consolation.
The three youths<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> were captives; Daniel was a
captive; so were other prophets: and God, the comforter, did
not fail them. And in like manner He has not failed His
own people in the power of a nation which, though barbarous,
is yet human,&mdash;He who did not abandon the prophet<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in the
belly of a monster. These things, indeed, are turned to ridicule
rather than credited by those with whom we are debating;
though they believe what they read in their own books,
that Arion of Methymna, the famous lyrist,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> when he was
thrown overboard, was received on a dolphin's back and carried
to land. But that story of ours about the prophet Jonah is
far more incredible,&mdash;more incredible because more marvellous,
and more marvellous because a greater exhibition of power.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>Of Regulus, in whom we have an example of the voluntary endurance of
captivity for the sake of religion; which yet did not profit him, though he
was a worshipper of the gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But among their own famous men they have a very noble
example of the voluntary endurance of captivity in obedience
to a religious scruple. Marcus Attilius Regulus, a Roman
general, was a prisoner in the hands of the Carthaginians.
But they, being more anxious to exchange their prisoners with
the Romans than to keep them, sent Regulus as a special
envoy with their own ambassadors to negotiate this exchange,
but bound him first with an oath, that if he failed to accomplish
their wish, he would return to Carthage. He went,
and persuaded the senate to the opposite course, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
believed it was not for the advantage of the Roman republic
to make an exchange of prisoners. After he had thus exerted
his influence, the Romans did not compel him to return to the
enemy; but what he had sworn he voluntarily performed.
But the Carthaginians put him to death with refined, elaborate,
and horrible tortures. They shut him up in a narrow
box, in which he was compelled to stand, and in which finely
sharpened nails were fixed all round about him, so that he
could not lean upon any part of it without intense pain; and
so they killed him by depriving him of sleep.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> With justice,
indeed, do they applaud the virtue which rose superior to so
frightful a fate. However, the gods he swore by were those
who are now supposed to avenge the prohibition of their worship,
by inflicting these present calamities on the human race.
But if these gods, who were worshipped specially in this
behalf, that they might confer happiness in this life, either
willed or permitted these punishments to be inflicted on one
who kept his oath to them, what more cruel punishment
could they in their anger have inflicted on a perjured person?
But why may I not draw from my reasoning a double inference?
Regulus certainly had such reverence for the gods,
that for his oath's sake he would neither remain in his own
land, nor go elsewhere, but without hesitation returned to his
bitterest enemies. If he thought that this course would be
advantageous with respect to this present life, he was certainly
much deceived, for it brought his life to a frightful termination.
By his own example, in fact, he taught that the gods
do not secure the temporal happiness of their worshippers;
since he himself, who was devoted to their worship, was both
conquered in battle and taken prisoner, and then, because he
refused to act in violation of the oath he had sworn by them,
was tortured and put to death by a new, and hitherto unheard
of, and all too horrible kind of punishment. And on the supposition
that the worshippers of the gods are rewarded by
felicity in the life to come, why, then, do they calumniate
the influence of Christianity? why do they assert that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
disaster has overtaken the city because it has ceased to worship
its gods, since, worship them as assiduously as it may, it
may yet be as unfortunate as Regulus was? Or will some
one carry so wonderful a blindness to the extent of wildly
attempting, in the face of the evident truth, to contend that
though one man might be unfortunate, though a worshipper of
the gods, yet a whole city could not be so? That is to say,
the power of their gods is better adapted to preserve multitudes
than individuals,&mdash;as if a multitude were not composed
of individuals.</p>

<p>But if they say that M. Regulus, even while a prisoner
and enduring these bodily torments, might yet enjoy the
blessedness of a virtuous soul,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> then let them recognise that
true virtue by which a city also may be blessed. For the
blessedness of a community and of an individual flow from
the same source; for a community is nothing else than a
harmonious collection of individuals. So that I am not concerned
meantime to discuss what kind of virtue Regulus
possessed: enough, that by his very noble example they are
forced to own that the gods are to be worshipped not for the
sake of bodily comforts or external advantages; for he preferred
to lose all such things rather than offend the gods by
whom he had sworn. But what can we make of men who
glory in having such a citizen, but dread having a city like
him? If they do not dread this, then let them acknowledge
that some such calamity as befell Regulus may also befall a
community, though they be worshipping their gods as diligently
as he; and let them no longer throw the blame of
their misfortunes on Christianity. But as our present concern
is with those Christians who were taken prisoners, let
those who take occasion from this calamity to revile our most
wholesome religion in a fashion not less imprudent than impudent,
consider this and hold their peace; for if it was no
reproach to their gods that a most punctilious worshipper of
theirs should, for the sake of keeping his oath to them, be
deprived of his native land without hope of finding another,
and fall into the hands of his enemies, and be put to death
by a long-drawn and exquisite torture, much less ought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Christian name to be charged with the captivity of those who
believe in its power, since they, in confident expectation of a
heavenly country, know that they are pilgrims even in their
own homes.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>16. <i>Of the violation of the consecrated and other Christian virgins to which they
were subjected in captivity, and to which their own will gave no consent;
and whether this contaminated their souls.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But they fancy they bring a conclusive charge against
Christianity, when they aggravate the horror of captivity by
adding that not only wives and unmarried maidens, but even
consecrated virgins, were violated. But truly, with respect to
this, it is not Christian faith, nor piety, nor even the virtue
of chastity, which is hemmed into any difficulty: the only
difficulty is so to treat the subject as to satisfy at once
modesty and reason. And in discussing it we shall not be so
careful to reply to our accusers as to comfort our friends.
Let this, therefore, in the first place, be laid down as an unassailable
position, that the virtue which makes the life good
has its throne in the soul, and thence rules the members of
the body, which becomes holy in virtue of the holiness of the
will; and that while the will remains firm and unshaken,
nothing that another person does with the body, or upon the
body, is any fault of the person who suffers it, so long as he
cannot escape it without sin. But as not only pain may be
inflicted, but lust gratified on the body of another, whenever
anything of this latter kind takes place, shame invades even a
thoroughly pure spirit from which modesty has not departed,&mdash;shame,
lest that act which could not be suffered without
some sensual pleasure, should be believed to have been committed
also with some assent of the will.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of suicide committed through fear of punishment or dishonour.</i></p>

<p>And consequently, even if some of these virgins killed themselves
to avoid such disgrace, who that has any human feeling
would refuse to forgive them? And as for those who would
not put an end to their lives, lest they might seem to escape
the crime of another by a sin of their own, he who lays this
to their charge as a great wickedness is himself not guiltless
of the fault of folly. For if it is not lawful to take the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
into our own hands, and slay even a guilty person, whose
death no public sentence has warranted, then certainly he
who kills himself is a homicide, and so much the guiltier of
his own death, as he was more innocent of that offence for
which he doomed himself to die. Do we justly execrate the
deed of Judas, and does truth itself pronounce that by hanging
himself he rather aggravated than expiated the guilt of
that most iniquitous betrayal, since, by despairing of God's
mercy in his sorrow that wrought death, he left to himself no
place for a healing penitence? How much more ought he to
abstain from laying violent hands on himself who has done
nothing worthy of such a punishment! For Judas, when he
killed himself, killed a wicked man; but he passed from this
life chargeable not only with the death of Christ, but with
his own: for though he killed himself on account of his crime,
his killing himself was another crime. Why, then, should a
man who has done no ill do ill to himself, and by killing
himself kill the innocent to escape another's guilty act, and
perpetrate upon himself a sin of his own, that the sin of
another may not be perpetrated on him?</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the violence which may be done to the body by another's lust, while the
mind remains inviolate.</i></p>

<p>But is there a fear that even another's lust may pollute
the violated? It will not pollute, if it be another's: if it
pollute, it is not another's, but is shared also by the polluted.
But since purity is a virtue of the soul, and has for its companion
virtue the fortitude which will rather endure all ills
than consent to evil; and since no one, however magnanimous
and pure, has always the disposal of his own body, but can
control only the consent and refusal of his will, what sane
man can suppose that, if his body be seized and forcibly made
use of to satisfy the lust of another, he thereby loses his
purity? For if purity can be thus destroyed, then assuredly
purity is no virtue of the soul; nor can it be numbered
among those good things by which the life is made good, but
among the good things of the body, in the same category as
strength, beauty, sound and unbroken health, and, in short, all
such good things as may be diminished without at all diminishing
the goodness and rectitude of our life. But if purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
be nothing better than these, why should the body be perilled
that it may be preserved? If, on the other hand, it belongs
to the soul, then not even when the body is violated is it
lost. Nay more, the virtue of holy continence, when it resists
the uncleanness of carnal lust, sanctifies even the body, and
therefore when this continence remains unsubdued, even the
sanctity of the body is preserved, because the will to use it
holily remains, and, so far as lies in the body itself, the power
also.</p>

<p>For the sanctity of the body does not consist in the integrity
of its members, nor in their exemption from all touch;
for they are exposed to various accidents which do violence to
and wound them, and the surgeons who administer relief often
perform operations that sicken the spectator. A midwife,
suppose, has (whether maliciously or accidentally, or through
unskilfulness) destroyed the virginity of some girl, while
endeavouring to ascertain it: I suppose no one is so foolish
as to believe that, by this destruction of the integrity of one
organ, the virgin has lost anything even of her bodily sanctity.
And thus, so long as the soul keeps this firmness of purpose
which sanctifies even the body, the violence done by another's
lust makes no impression on this bodily sanctity, which is
preserved intact by one's own persistent continence. Suppose
a virgin violates the oath she has sworn to God, and goes to
meet her seducer with the intention of yielding to him, shall
we say that as she goes she is possessed even of bodily
sanctity, when already she has lost and destroyed that sanctity
of soul which sanctifies the body? Far be it from us to so
misapply words. Let us rather draw this conclusion, that while
the sanctity of the soul remains even when the body is
violated, the sanctity of the body is not lost; and that, in like
manner, the sanctity of the body is lost when the sanctity of
the soul is violated, though the body itself remain intact.
And therefore a woman who has been violated by the sin of
another, and without any consent of her own, has no cause to
put herself to death; much less has she cause to commit
suicide in order to avoid such violation, for in that case she
commits certain homicide to prevent a crime which is uncertain
as yet, and not her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of Lucretia, who put an end to her life because of the outrage done her.</i></p>

<p>This, then, is our position, and it seems sufficiently lucid.
We maintain that when a woman is violated while her soul
admits no consent to the iniquity, but remains inviolably
chaste, the sin is not hers, but his who violates her. But do
they against whom we have to defend not only the souls, but
the sacred bodies too of these outraged Christian captives,&mdash;do
they, perhaps, dare to dispute our position? But all know how
loudly they extol the purity of Lucretia, that noble matron
of ancient Rome. When King Tarquin's son had violated
her body, she made known the wickedness of this young
profligate to her husband Collatinus, and to Brutus her kinsman,
men of high rank and full of courage, and bound them
by an oath to avenge it. Then, heart-sick, and unable to bear
the shame, she put an end to her life. What shall we call
her? An adulteress, or chaste? There is no question which
she was. Not more happily than truly did a declaimer say of
this sad occurrence: "Here was a marvel: there were two,
and only one committed adultery." Most forcibly and truly
spoken. For this declaimer, seeing in the union of the two
bodies the foul lust of the one, and the chaste will of the
other, and giving heed not to the contact of the bodily members,
but to the wide diversity of their souls, says: "There
were two, but the adultery was committed only by one."</p>

<p>But how is it, that she who was no partner to the crime
bears the heavier punishment of the two? For the adulterer
was only banished along with his father; she suffered the
extreme penalty. If that was not impurity by which she
was unwillingly ravished, then this is not justice by which
she, being chaste, is punished. To you I appeal, ye laws
and judges of Rome. Even after the perpetration of great
enormities, you do not suffer the criminal to be slain untried.
If, then, one were to bring to your bar this case, and were to
prove to you that a woman not only untried, but chaste and
innocent, had been killed, would you not visit the murderer
with punishment proportionably severe? This crime was
committed by Lucretia; that Lucretia so celebrated and
lauded slew the innocent, chaste, outraged Lucretia. Pronounce
sentence. But if you cannot, because there does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
compear any one whom you can punish, why do you extol
with such unmeasured laudation her who slew an innocent
and chaste woman? Assuredly you will find it impossible
to defend her before the judges of the realms below, if they be
such as your poets are fond of representing them; for she is
among those</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who guiltless sent themselves to doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all for loathing of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In madness threw their lives away."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And if she with the others wishes to return,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fate bars the way: around their keep<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The slow unlovely waters creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And bind with ninefold chain."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or perhaps she is not there, because she slew herself conscious
of guilt, not of innocence? She herself alone knows
her reason; but what if she was betrayed by the pleasure
of the act, and gave some consent to Sextus, though so violently
abusing her, and then was so affected with remorse,
that she thought death alone could expiate her sin? Even
though this were the case, she ought still to have held her
hand from suicide, if she could with her false gods have
accomplished a fruitful repentance. However, if such were
the state of the case, and if it were false that there were two,
but one only committed adultery; if the truth were that both
were involved in it, one by open assault, the other by secret
consent, then she did not kill an innocent woman; and therefore
her erudite defenders may maintain that she is not
among that class of the dwellers below "who guiltless sent
themselves to doom." But this case of Lucretia is in such a
dilemma, that if you extenuate the homicide, you confirm the
adultery: if you acquit her of adultery, you make the charge
of homicide heavier; and there is no way out of the dilemma,
when one asks, If she was adulterous, why praise her? if
chaste, why slay her?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for our purpose of refuting those who are
unable to comprehend what true sanctity is, and who therefore
insult over our outraged Christian women, it is enough that in
the instance of this noble Roman matron it was said in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
praise, "There were two, but the adultery was the crime
of only one." For Lucretia was confidently believed to be
superior to the contamination of any consenting thought to
the adultery. And accordingly, since she killed herself for
being subjected to an outrage in which she had no guilty
part, it is obvious that this act of hers was prompted not by
the love of purity, but by the overwhelming burden of her
shame. She was ashamed that so foul a crime had been perpetrated
upon her, though without her abetting; and this
matron, with the Roman love of glory in her veins, was
seized with a proud dread that, if she continued to live, it
would be supposed she willingly did not resent the wrong
that had been done her. She could not exhibit to men her
conscience, but she judged that her self-inflicted punishment
would testify her state of mind; and she burned with shame
at the thought that her patient endurance of the foul affront
that another had done her, should be construed into complicity
with him. Not such was the decision of the Christian women
who suffered as she did, and yet survive. They declined to
avenge upon themselves the guilt of others, and so add crimes
of their own to those crimes in which they had no share.
For this they would have done had their shame driven them
to homicide, as the lust of their enemies had driven them
to adultery. Within their own souls, in the witness of
their own conscience, they enjoy the glory of chastity. In
the sight of God, too, they are esteemed pure, and this contents
them; they ask no more: it suffices them to have
opportunity of doing good, and they decline to evade the
distress of human suspicion, lest they thereby deviate from
the divine law.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>That Christians have no authority for committing suicide in any
circumstances whatever.</i></p>

<p>It is not without significance, that in no passage of the
holy canonical books there can be found either divine precept
or permission to take away our own life, whether for the sake
of entering on the enjoyment of immortality, or of shunning,
or ridding ourselves of anything whatever. Nay, the law,
rightly interpreted, even prohibits suicide, where it says,
"Thou shalt not kill." This is proved specially by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
omission of the words "thy neighbour," which are inserted
when false witness is forbidden: "Thou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbour." Nor yet should any one on
this account suppose he has not broken this commandment if
he has borne false witness only against himself. For the love
of our neighbour is regulated by the love of ourselves, as it is
written, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." If, then,
he who makes false statements about himself is not less guilty
of bearing false witness than if he had made them to the injury
of his neighbour; although in the commandment prohibiting
false witness only his neighbour is mentioned, and persons
taking no pains to understand it might suppose that a man
was allowed to be a false witness to his own hurt; how much
greater reason have we to understand that a man may not
kill himself, since in the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill,"
there is no limitation added nor any exception made in favour
of any one, and least of all in favour of him on whom the
command is laid! And so some attempt to extend this command
even to beasts and cattle, as if it forbade us to take life
from any creature. But if so, why not extend it also to the
plants, and all that is rooted in and nourished by the earth?
For though this class of creatures have no sensation, yet they
also are said to live, and consequently they can die; and therefore,
if violence be done them, can be killed. So, too, the
apostle, when speaking of the seeds of such things as these,
says, "That which thou sowest is not quickened except it
die;" and in the Psalm it is said, "He killed their vines with
hail." Must we therefore reckon it a breaking of this commandment,
"Thou shalt not kill," to pull a flower? Are we
thus insanely to countenance the foolish error of the Manichæans?
Putting aside, then, these ravings, if, when we say,
Thou shalt not kill, we do not understand this of the plants,
since they have no sensation, nor of the irrational animals
that fly, swim, walk, or creep, since they are dissociated from
us by their want of reason, and are therefore by the just
appointment of the Creator subjected to us to kill or keep
alive for our own uses; if so, then it remains that we understand
that commandment simply of man. The commandment
is, "Thou shalt not kill man;" therefore neither another nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
yourself, for he who kills himself still kills nothing else than
man.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the cases in which we may put men to death without incurring the guilt
of murder.</i></p>

<p>However, there are some exceptions made by the divine
authority to its own law, that men may not be put to death.
These exceptions are of two kinds, being justified either by a
general law, or by a special commission granted for a time to
some individual. And in this latter case, he to whom authority
is delegated, and who is but the sword in the hand of him
who uses it, is not himself responsible for the death he deals.
And, accordingly, they who have waged war in obedience to
the divine command, or in conformity with His laws have
represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom
of government, and in this capacity have put to death wicked
men; such persons have by no means violated the commandment,
"Thou shalt not kill." Abraham indeed was not merely
deemed guiltless of cruelty, but was even applauded for his
piety, because he was ready to slay his son in obedience to
God, not to his own passion. And it is reasonably enough
made a question, whether we are to esteem it to have been in
compliance with a command of God that Jephthah killed his
daughter, because she met him when he had vowed that he
would sacrifice to God whatever first met him as he returned
victorious from battle. Samson, too, who drew down the
house on himself and his foes together, is justified only on
this ground, that the Spirit who wrought wonders by him
had given him secret instructions to do this. With the exception,
then, of these two classes of cases, which are justified
either by a just law that applies generally, or by a special intimation
from God Himself, the fountain of all justice, whoever
kills a man, either himself or another, is implicated in the
guilt of murder.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>That suicide can never be prompted by magnanimity.</i></p>

<p>But they who have laid violent hands on themselves are
perhaps to be admired for their greatness of soul, though they
cannot be applauded for the soundness of their judgment.
However, if you look at the matter more closely, you will
scarcely call it greatness of soul, which prompts a man to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
himself rather than bear up against some hardships of fortune,
or sins in which he is not implicated. Is it not rather proof
of a feeble mind, to be unable to bear either the pains of
bodily servitude or the foolish opinion of the vulgar? And
is not that to be pronounced the greater mind, which rather
faces than flees the ills of life, and which, in comparison of
the light and purity of conscience, holds in small esteem the
judgment of men, and specially of the vulgar, which is frequently
involved in a mist of error? And, therefore, if suicide is to be
esteemed a magnanimous act, none can take higher rank for
magnanimity than that Cleombrotus, who (as the story goes),
when he had read Plato's book in which he treats of the
immortality of the soul, threw himself from a wall, and so
passed from this life to that which he believed to be better.
For he was not hard pressed by calamity, nor by any accusation,
false or true, which he could not very well have lived
down: there was, in short, no motive but only magnanimity
urging him to seek death, and break away from the sweet
detention of this life. And yet that this was a magnanimous
rather than a justifiable action, Plato himself, whom he had
read, would have told him; for he would certainly have been
forward to commit, or at least to recommend suicide, had not
the same bright intellect which saw that the soul was immortal,
discerned also that to seek immortality by suicide was
to be prohibited rather than encouraged.</p>

<p>Again, it is said many have killed themselves to prevent
an enemy doing so. But we are not inquiring whether it has
been done, but whether it ought to have been done. Sound
judgment is to be preferred even to examples, and indeed
examples harmonize with the voice of reason; but not all
examples, but those only which are distinguished by their
piety, and are proportionately worthy of imitation. For
suicide we cannot cite the example of patriarchs, prophets, or
apostles; though our Lord Jesus Christ, when He admonished
them to flee from city to city if they were persecuted, might
very well have taken that occasion to advise them to lay
violent hands on themselves, and so escape their persecutors.
But seeing He did not do this, nor proposed this mode of
departing this life, though He were addressing His own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
friends for whom He had promised to prepare everlasting
mansions, it is obvious that such examples as are produced
from the "nations that forget God," give no warrant of imitation
to the worshippers of the one true God.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>What we are to think of the example of Cato, who slew himself because
unable to endure Cæsar's victory.</i></p>

<p>Besides Lucretia, of whom enough has already been said,
our advocates of suicide have some difficulty in finding any
other prescriptive example, unless it be that of Cato, who
killed himself at Utica. His example is appealed to, not
because he was the only man who did so, but because he was
so esteemed as a learned and excellent man, that it could
plausibly be maintained that what he did was and is a good
thing to do. But of this action of his, what can I say but
that his own friends, enlightened men as he, prudently dissuaded
him, and therefore judged his act to be that of a feeble
rather than a strong spirit, and dictated not by honourable
feeling forestalling shame, but by weakness shrinking from
hardships? Indeed, Cato condemns himself by the advice he
gave to his dearly loved son. For if it was a disgrace to live
under Cæsar's rule, why did the father urge the son to this
disgrace, by encouraging him to trust absolutely to Cæsar's
generosity? Why did he not persuade him to die along
with himself? If Torquatus was applauded for putting
his son to death, when contrary to orders he had engaged,
and engaged successfully, with the enemy, why did conquered
Cato spare his conquered son, though he did not spare
himself? Was it more disgraceful to be a victor contrary to
orders, than to submit to a victor contrary to the received
ideas of honour? Cato, then, cannot have deemed it to be
shameful to live under Cæsar's rule, for had he done so, the
father's sword would have delivered his son from this disgrace.
The truth is, that his son, whom he both hoped and desired
would be spared by Cæsar, was not more loved by him than
Cæsar was envied the glory of pardoning him (as indeed
Cæsar himself is reported to have said<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>); or if envy is too
strong a word, let us say he was <i>ashamed</i> that this glory should
be his.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">24. <i>That in that virtue in which Regulus excels Cato, Christians are
pre-eminently distinguished.</i></p>

<p>Our opponents are offended at our preferring to Cato the
saintly Job, who endured dreadful evils in his body rather
than deliver himself from all torment by self-inflicted death;
or other saints, of whom it is recorded in our authoritative
and trustworthy books that they bore captivity and the oppression
of their enemies rather than commit suicide. But their
own books authorize us to prefer to Marcus Cato, Marcus
Regulus. For Cato had never conquered Cæsar; and when
conquered by him, disdained to submit himself to him, and
that he might escape this submission put himself to death.
Regulus, on the contrary, had formerly conquered the Carthaginians,
and in command of the army of Rome had won for
the Roman republic a victory which no citizen could bewail,
and which the enemy himself was constrained to admire; yet
afterwards, when he in his turn was defeated by them, he preferred
to be their captive rather than to put himself beyond
their reach by suicide. Patient under the domination of the
Carthaginians, and constant in his love of the Romans, he
neither deprived the one of his conquered body, nor the other
of his unconquered spirit. Neither was it love of life that
prevented him from killing himself. This was plainly enough
indicated by his unhesitatingly returning, on account of his
promise and oath, to the same enemies whom he had more
grievously provoked by his words in the senate than even
by his arms in battle. Having such a contempt of life, and
preferring to end it by whatever torments excited enemies
might contrive, rather than terminate it by his own hand,
he could not more distinctly have declared how great a crime
he judged suicide to be. Among all their famous and remarkable
citizens, the Romans have no better man to boast of than
this, who was neither corrupted by prosperity, for he remained
a very poor man after winning such victories; nor broken by
adversity, for he returned intrepidly to the most miserable
end. But if the bravest and most renowned heroes, who had
but an earthly country to defend, and who, though they had
but false gods, yet rendered them a true worship, and carefully
kept their oath to them; if these men, who by the custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and right of war put conquered enemies to the sword, yet
shrank from putting an end to their own lives even when
conquered by their enemies; if, though they had no fear at
all of death, they would yet rather suffer slavery than commit
suicide, how much rather must Christians, the worshippers of
the true God, the aspirants to a heavenly citizenship, shrink
from this act, if in God's providence they have been for a
season delivered into the hands of their enemies to prove or
to correct them! And, certainly, Christians subjected to this
humiliating condition will not be deserted by the Most High,
who for their sakes humbled Himself. Neither should they
forget that they are bound by no laws of war, nor military
orders, to put even a conquered enemy to the sword; and if
a man may not put to death the enemy who has sinned, or
may yet sin against him, who is so infatuated as to maintain
that he may kill himself because an enemy has sinned, or is
going to sin, against him?</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>That we should not endeavour by sin to obviate sin.</i></p>

<p>But, we are told, there is ground to fear that, when the
body is subjected to the enemy's lust, the insidious pleasure
of sense may entice the soul to consent to the sin, and steps
must be taken to prevent so disastrous a result. And is not
suicide the proper mode of preventing not only the enemy's
sin, but the sin of the Christian so allured? Now, in the
first place, the soul which is led by God and His wisdom,
rather than by bodily concupiscence, will certainly never consent
to the desire aroused in its own flesh by another's lust.
And, at all events, if it be true, as the truth plainly declares,
that suicide is a detestable and damnable wickedness, who is
such a fool as to say, Let us sin now, that we may obviate a
possible future sin; let us now commit murder, lest we perhaps
afterwards should commit adultery? If we are so controlled
by iniquity that innocence is out of the question, and
we can at best but make a choice of sins, is not a future and
uncertain adultery preferable to a present and certain murder?
Is it not better to commit a wickedness which penitence may
heal, than a crime which leaves no place for healing contrition?
I say this for the sake of those men or women who
fear they may be enticed into consenting to their violator's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
lust, and think they should lay violent hands on themselves,
and so prevent, not another's sin, but their own. But far be
it from the mind of a Christian confiding in God, and resting
in the hope of His aid; far be it, I say, from such a mind
to yield a shameful consent to pleasures of the flesh, howsoever
presented. And if that lustful disobedience, which
still dwells in our mortal members, follows its own law irrespective
of our will, surely its motions in the body of one
who rebels against them are as blameless as its motions in
the body of one who sleeps.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That in certain peculiar cases the examples of the saints are not to be
followed.</i></p>

<p>But, they say, in the time of persecution some holy women
escaped those who menaced them with outrage, by casting
themselves into rivers which they knew would drown them;
and having died in this manner, they are venerated in the
church catholic as martyrs. Of such persons I do not presume
to speak rashly. I cannot tell whether there may not
have been vouchsafed to the church some divine authority,
proved by trustworthy evidences, for so honouring their memory:
it may be that it is so. It may be they were not deceived by
human judgment, but prompted by divine wisdom, to their
act of self-destruction. We know that this was the case
with Samson. And when God enjoins any act, and intimates
by plain evidence that He has enjoined it, who will call
obedience criminal? Who will accuse so religious a submission?
But then every man is not justified in sacrificing his
son to God, because Abraham was commendable in so doing.
The soldier who has slain a man in obedience to the authority
under which he is lawfully commissioned, is not accused
of murder by any law of his state; nay, if he has not slain
him, it is then he is accused of treason to the state, and of
despising the law. But if he has been acting on his own
authority, and at his own impulse, he has in this case
incurred the crime of shedding human blood. And thus
he is punished for doing without orders the very thing he
is punished for neglecting to do when he has been ordered.
If the commands of a general make so great a difference, shall
the commands of God make none? He, then, who knows it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
is unlawful to kill himself, may nevertheless do so if he is
ordered by Him whose commands we may not neglect. Only
let him be very sure that the divine command has been
signified. As for us, we can become privy to the secrets
of conscience only in so far as these are disclosed to us, and
so far only do we judge: "No one knoweth the things of a
man, save the spirit of man which is in him."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But this we
affirm, this we maintain, this we every way pronounce to be
right, that no man ought to inflict on himself voluntary death,
for this is to escape the ills of time by plunging into those of
eternity; that no man ought to do so on account of another
man's sins, for this were to escape a guilt which could not
pollute him, by incurring great guilt of his own; that no man
ought to do so on account of his own past sins, for he has all
the more need of this life that these sins may be healed by
repentance; that no man should put an end to this life to
obtain that better life we look for after death, for those who
die by their own hand have no better life after death.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Whether voluntary death should be sought in order to avoid sin.</i></p>

<p>There remains one reason for suicide which I mentioned
before, and which is thought a sound one,&mdash;namely, to prevent
one's falling into sin either through the blandishments of
pleasure or the violence of pain. If this reason were a good
one, then we should be impelled to exhort men at once to
destroy themselves, as soon as they have been washed in the
laver of regeneration, and have received the forgiveness of all
sin. Then is the time to escape all future sin, when all past
sin is blotted out. And if this escape be lawfully secured by
suicide, why not then specially? Why does any baptized person
hold his hand from taking his own life? Why does any
person who is freed from the hazards of this life again expose
himself to them, when he has power so easily to rid himself
of them all, and when it is written, "He who loveth danger
shall fall into it?"<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Why does he love, or at least face, so
many serious dangers, by remaining in this life from which
he may legitimately depart? But is any one so blinded and
twisted in his moral nature, and so far astray from the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
as to think that, though a man ought to make away with himself
for fear of being led into sin by the oppression of one
man, his master, he ought yet to live, and so expose himself
to the hourly temptations of this world, both to all those
evils which the oppression of one master involves, and to
numberless other miseries in which this life inevitably implicates
us? What reason, then, is there for our consuming time
in those exhortations by which we seek to animate the baptized,
either to virginal chastity, or vidual continence, or
matrimonial fidelity, when we have so much more simple
and compendious a method of deliverance from sin, by persuading
those who are fresh from baptism to put an end to
their lives, and so pass to their Lord pure and well-conditioned?
If any one thinks that such persuasion should be attempted, I
say not he is foolish, but mad. With what face, then, can he
say to any man, "Kill yourself, lest to your small sins you
add a heinous sin, while you live under an unchaste master,
whose conduct is that of a barbarian?" How can he say this,
if he cannot without wickedness say, "Kill yourself, now that
you are washed from all your sins, lest you fall again into
similar or even aggravated sins, while you live in a world
which has such power to allure by its unclean pleasures, to
torment by its horrible cruelties, to overcome by its errors
and terrors?" It is wicked to say this; it is therefore wicked
to kill oneself. For if there could be any just cause of
suicide, this were so. And since not even this is so, there is
none.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>By what judgment of God the enemy was permitted to indulge his lust on the
bodies of continent Christians.</i></p>

<p>Let not your life, then, be a burden to you, ye faithful servants
of Christ, though your chastity was made the sport
of your enemies. You have a grand and true consolation, if
you maintain a good conscience, and know that you did not
consent to the sins of those who were permitted to commit
sinful outrage upon you. And if you should ask why this
permission was granted, indeed it is a deep providence of the
Creator and Governor of the world; and "unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding out."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
faithfully interrogate your own souls, whether ye have not
been unduly puffed up by your integrity, and continence, and
chastity; and whether ye have not been so desirous of the
human praise that is accorded to these virtues, that ye have
envied some who possessed them. I, for my part, do not
know your hearts, and therefore I make no accusation; I do
not even hear what your hearts answer when you question
them. And yet, if they answer that it is as I have supposed
it might be, do not marvel that you have lost that by which
you can win men's praise, and retain that which cannot be
exhibited to men. If you did not consent to sin, it was
because God added His aid to His grace that it might not
be lost, and because shame before men succeeded to human
glory that it might not be loved. But in both respects even
the fainthearted among you have a consolation, approved by
the one experience, chastened by the other; justified by the
one, corrected by the other. As to those whose hearts, when
interrogated, reply that they have never been proud of the
virtue of virginity, widowhood, or matrimonial chastity, but,
condescending to those of low estate, rejoiced with trembling
in these gifts of God, and that they have never envied any
one the like excellences of sanctity and purity, but rose
superior to human applause, which is wont to be abundant in
proportion to the rarity of the virtue applauded, and rather
desired that their own number be increased, than that by the
smallness of their numbers each of them should be conspicuous;&mdash;even
such faithful women, I say, must not complain
that permission was given to the barbarians so grossly to
outrage them; nor must they allow themselves to believe that
God overlooked their character when He permitted acts which
no one with impunity commits. For some most flagrant and
wicked desires are allowed free play at present by the secret
judgment of God, and are reserved to the public and final
judgment. Moreover, it is possible that those Christian
women, who are unconscious of any undue pride on account
of their virtuous chastity, whereby they sinlessly suffered the
violence of their captors, had yet some lurking infirmity which
might have betrayed them into a proud and contemptuous
bearing, had they not been subjected to the humiliation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
befell them in the taking of the city. As, therefore, some
men were removed by death, that no wickedness might change
their disposition, so these women were outraged lest prosperity
should corrupt their modesty. Neither those women, then,
who were already puffed up by the circumstance that they
were still virgins, nor those who might have been so puffed
up had they not been exposed to the violence of the enemy,
lost their chastity, but rather gained humility: the former
were saved from pride already cherished, the latter from pride
that would shortly have grown upon them.</p>

<p>We must further notice that some of those sufferers may
have conceived that continence is a bodily good, and abides
so long as the body is inviolate, and did not understand that
the purity both of the body and the soul rests on the stedfastness
of the will strengthened by God's grace, and cannot
be forcibly taken from an unwilling person. From this error
they are probably now delivered. For when they reflect how
conscientiously they served God, and when they settle again
to the firm persuasion that He can in nowise desert those
who so serve Him, and so invoke His aid; and when they
consider, what they cannot doubt, how pleasing to Him is
chastity, they are shut up to the conclusion that He could
never have permitted these disasters to befall His saints, if by
them that saintliness could be destroyed which He Himself
had bestowed upon them, and delights to see in them.</p>

<p>29. <i>What the servants of Christ should say in reply to the unbelievers who cast in
their teeth that Christ did not rescue them from the fury of their enemies.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The whole family of God, most high and most true, has
therefore a consolation of its own,&mdash;a consolation which cannot
deceive, and which has in it a surer hope than the tottering
and falling affairs of earth can afford. They will not refuse
the discipline of this temporal life, in which they are schooled
for life eternal; nor will they lament their experience of it,

where their gods are when they suffer the very calamities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the sake of avoiding which they worship their gods, or maintain
they ought to be worshipped; for the family of Christ is
furnished with its reply: our God is everywhere present,
wholly everywhere; not confined to any place. He can be
present unperceived, and be absent without moving; when
He exposes us to adversities, it is either to prove our perfections
or correct our imperfections; and in return for our
patient endurance of the sufferings of time, He reserves for us
an everlasting reward. But who are you, that we should
deign to speak with you even about your own gods, much
less about our God, who is "to be feared above all gods? For
all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the
heavens."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>


<p class="center">30. <i>That those who complain of Christianity really desire to live without
restraint in shameful luxury.</i></p>

<p>If the famous Scipio Nasica were now alive, who was once
your pontiff, and was unanimously chosen by the senate,
when, in the panic created by the Punic war, they sought for
the best citizen to entertain the Phrygian goddess, he would
curb this shamelessness of yours, though you would perhaps
scarcely dare to look upon the countenance of such a man.
For why in your calamities do you complain of Christianity,
unless because you desire to enjoy your luxurious licence
unrestrained, and to lead an abandoned and profligate life
without the interruption of any uneasiness or disaster? For
certainly your desire for peace, and prosperity, and plenty is
not prompted by any purpose of using these blessings honestly,
that is to say, with moderation, sobriety, temperance, and
piety; for your purpose rather is to run riot in an endless
variety of sottish pleasures, and thus to generate from your
prosperity a moral pestilence which will prove a thousand-fold
more disastrous than the fiercest enemies. It was such
a calamity as this that Scipio, your chief pontiff, your best
man in the judgment of the whole senate, feared when he refused
to agree to the destruction of Carthage, Rome's rival;
and opposed Cato, who advised its destruction. He feared
security, that enemy of weak minds, and he perceived that a
wholesome fear would be a fit guardian for the citizens. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he was not mistaken: the event proved how wisely he had
spoken. For when Carthage was destroyed, and the Roman
republic delivered from its great cause of anxiety, a crowd
of disastrous evils forthwith resulted from the prosperous
condition of things. First concord was weakened, and destroyed
by fierce and bloody seditions; then followed, by a
concatenation of baleful causes, civil wars, which brought in
their train such massacres, such bloodshed, such lawless and
cruel proscription and plunder, that those Romans who, in the
days of their virtue, had expected injury only at the hands of
their enemies, now that their virtue was lost, suffered greater
cruelties at the hands of their fellow-citizens. The lust of
rule, which with other vices existed among the Romans in
more unmitigated intensity than among any other people, after
it had taken possession of the more powerful few, subdued
under its yoke the rest, worn and wearied.</p>


<p class="center">31. <i>By what steps the passion for governing increased among the Romans.</i></p>

<p>For at what stage would that passion rest when once it
has lodged in a proud spirit, until by a succession of advances
it has reached even the throne? And to obtain such advances
nothing avails but unscrupulous ambition. But unscrupulous
ambition has nothing to work upon, save in a nation corrupted
by avarice and luxury. Moreover, a people becomes avaricious
and luxurious by prosperity; and it was this which that very
prudent man Nasica was endeavouring to avoid when he
opposed the destruction of the greatest, strongest, wealthiest
city of Rome's enemy. He thought that thus fear would act as
a curb on lust, and that lust being curbed would not run riot
in luxury, and that luxury being prevented avarice would be
at an end; and that these vices being banished, virtue would
flourish and increase, to the great profit of the state; and
liberty, the fit companion of virtue, would abide unfettered.
For similar reasons, and animated by the same considerate
patriotism, that same chief pontiff of yours&mdash;I still refer to
him who was adjudged Rome's best man without one dissentient
voice&mdash;threw cold water on the proposal of the senate
to build a circle of seats round the theatre, and in a very
weighty speech warned them against allowing the luxurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
manners of Greece to sap the Roman manliness, and persuaded
them not to yield to the enervating and emasculating
influence of foreign licentiousness. So authoritative and
forcible were his words, that the senate was moved to prohibit
the use even of those benches which hitherto had been
customarily brought to the theatre for the temporary use of
the citizens.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> How eagerly would such a man as this have
banished from Rome the scenic exhibitions themselves, had
he dared to oppose the authority of those whom he supposed
to be gods! For he did not know that they were malicious
devils; or if he did, he supposed they should rather be propitiated
than despised. For there had not yet been revealed to
the Gentiles the heavenly doctrine which should purify their
hearts by faith, and transform their natural disposition by
humble godliness, and turn them from the service of proud
devils to seek the things that are in heaven, or even above
the heavens.</p>


<p class="center">32. <i>Of the establishment of scenic entertainments.</i></p>

<p>Know then, ye who are ignorant of this, and ye who feign
ignorance be reminded, while you murmur against Him who
has freed you from such rulers, that the scenic games, exhibitions
of shameless folly and licence, were established at
Rome, not by men's vicious cravings, but by the appointment
of your gods. Much more pardonably might you have
rendered divine honours to Scipio than to such gods as these.
The gods were not so moral as their pontiff. But give me
now your attention, if your mind, inebriated by its deep potations
of error, can take in any sober truth. The gods enjoined
that games be exhibited in their honour to stay a physical
pestilence; their pontiff prohibited the theatre from being constructed,
to prevent a moral pestilence. If, then, there remains
in you sufficient mental enlightenment to prefer the soul to
the body, choose whom you will worship. Besides, though
the pestilence was stayed, this was not because the voluptuous
madness of stage-plays had taken possession of a warlike
people hitherto accustomed only to the games of the circus;
but these astute and wicked spirits, foreseeing that in due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
course the pestilence would shortly cease, took occasion to
infect, not the bodies, but the morals of their worshippers, with
a far more serious disease. And in this pestilence these gods
find great enjoyment, because it benighted the minds of men
with so gross a darkness, and dishonoured them with so foul
a deformity, that even quite recently (will posterity be able to
credit it?) some of those who fled from the sack of Rome and
found refuge in Carthage, were so infected with this disease,
that day after day they seemed to contend with one another
who should most madly run after the actors in the theatres.</p>


<p class="center">33. <i>That the overthrow of Rome has not corrected the vices of the Romans.</i></p>

<p>Oh infatuated men, what is this blindness, or rather madness,
which possesses you? How is it that while, as we hear, even
the eastern nations are bewailing your ruin, and while powerful
states in the most remote parts of the earth are mourning
your fall as a public calamity, ye yourselves should be crowding
to the theatres, should be pouring into them and filling
them; and, in short, be playing a madder part now than ever
before? This was the foul plague-spot, this the wreck of
virtue and honour that Scipio sought to preserve you from
when he prohibited the construction of theatres; this was his
reason for desiring that you might still have an enemy to fear,
seeing as he did how easily prosperity would corrupt and
destroy you. He did not consider that republic flourishing
whose walls stand, but whose morals are in ruins. But the
seductions of evil-minded devils had more influence with you
than the precautions of prudent men. Hence the injuries
you do, you will not permit to be imputed to you; but the
injuries you suffer, you impute to Christianity. Depraved by
good fortune, and not chastened by adversity, what you desire
in the restoration of a peaceful and secure state, is not the
tranquillity of the commonwealth, but the impunity of your
own vicious luxury. Scipio wished you to be hard pressed
by an enemy, that you might not abandon yourselves to luxurious
manners; but so abandoned are you, that not even
when crushed by the enemy is your luxury repressed. You
have missed the profit of your calamity; you have been made
most wretched, and have remained most profligate.</p>

<p class="center">34. <i>Of God's clemency in moderating the ruin of the city.</i></p>

<p>And that you are yet alive is due to God, who spares you that
you may be admonished to repent and reform your lives.
It is He who has permitted you, ungrateful as you are, to escape
the sword of the enemy, by calling yourselves His servants,
or by finding asylum in the sacred places of the martyrs.</p>

<p>It is said that Romulus and Remus, in order to increase
the population of the city they founded, opened a sanctuary
in which every man might find asylum and absolution of all
crime,&mdash;a remarkable foreshadowing of what has recently
occurred in honour of Christ. The destroyers of Rome followed
the example of its founders. But it was not greatly
to their credit that the latter, for the sake of increasing the
number of their citizens, did that which the former have done,
lest the number of their enemies should be diminished.</p>


<p class="center">35. <i>Of the sons of the church who are hidden among the wicked, and of false
Christians within the church.</i></p>

<p>Let these and similar answers (if any fuller and fitter answers
can be found) be given to their enemies by the redeemed family
of the Lord Christ, and by the pilgrim city of King Christ.
But let this city bear in mind, that among her enemies lie hid
those who are destined to be fellow-citizens, that she may
not think it a fruitless labour to bear what they inflict as
enemies until they become confessors of the faith. So, too,
as long as she is a stranger in the world, the city of God has
in her communion, and bound to her by the sacraments, some
who shall not eternally dwell in the lot of the saints. Of
these, some are not now recognised; others declare themselves,
and do not hesitate to make common cause with
our enemies in murmuring against God, whose sacramental
badge they wear. These men you may to-day see thronging
the churches with us, to-morrow crowding the theatres
with the godless. But we have the less reason to despair of
the reclamation even of such persons, if among our most
declared enemies there are now some, unknown to themselves,
who are destined to become our friends. In truth, these two
cities are entangled together in this world, and intermixed
until the last judgment effect their separation. I now proceed
to speak, as God shall help me, of the rise, progress, and end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of these two cities; and what I write, I write for the glory of
the city of God, that, being placed in comparison with the
other, it may shine with a brighter lustre.</p>


<p class="center">36. <i>What subjects are to be handled in the following discourse.</i></p>

<p>But I have still some things to say in confutation of those
who refer the disasters of the Roman republic to our religion,
because it prohibits the offering of sacrifices to the gods. For
this end I must recount all, or as many as may seem sufficient,
of the disasters which befell that city and its subject provinces,
before these sacrifices were prohibited; for all these disasters
they would doubtless have attributed to us, if at that time our
religion had shed its light upon them, and had prohibited their
sacrifices. I must then go on to show what social well-being
the true God, in whose hand are all kingdoms, vouchsafed to
grant to them that their empire might increase. I must show
why He did so, and how their false gods, instead of at all aiding
them, greatly injured them by guile and deceit. And, lastly, I
must meet those who, when on this point convinced and confuted
by irrefragable proofs, endeavour to maintain that they
worship the gods, not hoping for the present advantages of this
life, but for those which are to be enjoyed after death. And
this, if I am not mistaken, will be the most difficult part of my
task, and will be worthy of the loftiest argument; for we must
then enter the lists with the philosophers, not the mere common
herd of philosophers, but the most renowned, who in many points
agree with ourselves, as regarding the immortality of the soul,
and that the true God created the world, and by His providence
rules all He has created. But as they differ from us
on other points, we must not shrink from the task of exposing
their errors, that, having refuted the gainsaying of the wicked
with such ability as God may vouchsafe, we may assert the
city of God, and true piety, and the worship of God, to which
alone the promise of true and everlasting felicity is attached.
Here, then, let us conclude, that we may enter on these subjects
in a fresh book.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Of the limits which must be put to the necessity of replying to an adversary.</i></p>

<p>If the feeble mind of man did not presume to resist the clear
evidence of truth, but yielded its infirmity to wholesome
doctrines, as to a health-giving medicine, until it obtained from
God, by its faith and piety, the grace needed to heal it, they
who have just ideas, and express them in suitable language,
would need to use no long discourse to refute the errors of
empty conjecture. But this mental infirmity is now more
prevalent and hurtful than ever, to such an extent that even
after the truth has been as fully demonstrated as man can
prove it to man, they hold for the very truth their own unreasonable
fancies, either on account of their great blindness,
which prevents them from seeing what is plainly set before
them, or on account of their opinionative obstinacy, which prevents
them from acknowledging the force of what they do see.
There therefore frequently arises a necessity of speaking more
fully on those points which are already clear, that we may, as
it were, present them not to the eye, but even to the touch,
so that they may be felt even by those who close their eyes
against them. And yet to what end shall we ever bring our
discussions, or what bounds can be set to our discourse, if we
proceed on the principle that we must always reply to those
who reply to us? For those who are either unable to understand
our arguments, or are so hardened by the habit of contradiction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that though they understand they cannot yield to
them, reply to us, and, as it is written, "speak hard things,"<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
and are incorrigibly vain. Now, if we were to propose to confute
their objections as often as they with brazen face chose
to disregard our arguments, and as often as they could by any
means contradict our statements, you see how endless, and
fruitless, and painful a task we should be undertaking. And
therefore I do not wish my writings to be judged even by you,
my son Marcellinus, nor by any of those others at whose service
this work of mine is freely and in all Christian charity
put, if at least you intend always to require a reply to every
exception which you hear taken to what you read in it; for
so you would become like those silly women of whom the
apostle says that they are "always learning, and never able
to come to the knowledge of the truth."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Recapitulation of the contents of the first book.</i></p>

<p>In the foregoing book, having begun to speak of the city
of God, to which I have resolved, Heaven helping me, to consecrate
the whole of this work, it was my first endeavour
to reply to those who attribute the wars by which the world
is being devastated, and specially the recent sack of Rome
by the barbarians, to the religion of Christ, which prohibits
the offering of abominable sacrifices to devils. I have
shown that they ought rather to attribute it to Christ, that
for His name's sake the barbarians, in contravention of all
custom and law of war, threw open as sanctuaries the largest
churches, and in many instances showed such reverence to
Christ, that not only His genuine servants, but even those who
in their terror feigned themselves to be so, were exempted from
all those hardships which by the custom of war may lawfully
be inflicted. Then out of this there arose the question, why
wicked and ungrateful men were permitted to share in these
benefits; and why, too, the hardships and calamities of war
were inflicted on the godly as well as on the ungodly. And in
giving a suitably full answer to this large question, I occupied
some considerable space, partly that I might relieve the
anxieties which disturb many when they observe that the
blessings of God, and the common and daily human casualties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fall to the lot of bad men and good without distinction; but
mainly that I might minister some consolation to those holy
and chaste women who were outraged by the enemy, in such
a way as to shock their modesty, though not to sully their
purity, and that I might preserve them from being ashamed
of life, though they have no guilt to be ashamed of. And
then I briefly spoke against those who with a most shameless
wantonness insult over those poor Christians who were subjected
to those calamities, and especially over those broken-hearted
and humiliated, though chaste and holy women; these
fellows themselves being most depraved and unmanly profligates,
quite degenerate from the genuine Romans, whose
famous deeds are abundantly recorded in history, and everywhere
celebrated, but who have found in their descendants the
greatest enemies of their glory. In truth, Rome, which was
founded and increased by the labours of these ancient heroes,
was more shamefully ruined by their descendants, while its
walls were still standing, than it is now by the razing of them.
For in this ruin there fell stones and timbers; but in the ruin
those profligates effected, there fell, not the mural, but the
moral bulwarks and ornaments of the city, and their hearts
burned with passions more destructive than the flames which
consumed their houses. Thus I brought my first book to a
close. And now I go on to speak of those calamities which
that city itself, or its subject provinces, have suffered since
its foundation; all of which they would equally have attributed
to the Christian religion, if at that early period the
doctrine of the gospel against their false and deceiving gods
had been as largely and freely proclaimed as now.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>3. <i>That we need only to read history in order to see what calamities the Romans
suffered before the religion of Christ began to compete with the worship of

<p>But remember that, in recounting these things, I have still
to address myself to ignorant men; so ignorant, indeed, as to
give birth to the common saying, "Drought and Christianity
go hand in hand."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> There are indeed some among them who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
are thoroughly well educated men, and have a taste for history,
in which the things I speak of are open to their observation;
but in order to irritate the uneducated masses against us, they
feign ignorance of these events, and do what they can to make
the vulgar believe that those disasters, which in certain places
and at certain times uniformly befall mankind, are the result
of Christianity, which is being everywhere diffused, and is
possessed of a renown and brilliancy which quite eclipse
their own gods.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Let them then, along with us, call to mind
with what various and repeated disasters the prosperity of
Rome was blighted, before ever Christ had come in the flesh,
and before His name had been blazoned among the nations
with that glory which they vainly grudge. Let them, if they
can, defend their gods in this article, since they maintain
that they worship them in order to be preserved from these
disasters, which they now impute to us if they suffer in the
least degree. For why did these gods permit the disasters
I am to speak of to fall on their worshippers before the
preaching of Christ's name offended them, and put an end to
their sacrifices?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>4. <i>That the worshippers of the gods never received from them any healthy moral
precepts, and that in celebrating their worship all sorts of impurities were
practised.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>First of all, we would ask why their gods took no steps to
improve the morals of their worshippers. That the true God
should neglect those who did not seek His help, that was but
justice; but why did those gods, from whose worship ungrateful
men are now complaining that they are prohibited, issue
no laws which might have guided their devotees to a virtuous
life? Surely it was but just, that such care as men showed
to the worship of the gods, the gods on their part should have
to the conduct of men. But, it is replied, it is by his own
will a man goes astray. Who denies it? But none the less
was it incumbent on these gods, who were men's guardians,
to publish in plain terms the laws of a good life, and not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
conceal them from their worshippers. It was their part to
send prophets to reach and convict such as broke these laws,
and publicly to proclaim the punishments which await evildoers,
and the rewards which may be looked for by those that
do well. Did ever the walls of any of their temples echo to
any such warning voice? I myself, when I was a young
man, used sometimes to go to the sacrilegious entertainments
and spectacles; I saw the priests raving in religious excitement,
and heard the choristers; I took pleasure in the shameful
games which were celebrated in honour of gods and goddesses,
of the virgin C&#339;lestis,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and Berecynthia,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the mother of all the
gods. And on the holy day consecrated to her purification,
there were sung before her couch productions so obscene and
filthy for the ear&mdash;I do not say of the mother of the gods, but
of the mother of any senator or honest man&mdash;nay, so impure,
that not even the mother of the foul-mouthed players themselves
could have formed one of the audience. For natural
reverence for parents is a bond which the most abandoned
cannot ignore. And, accordingly, the lewd actions and filthy
words with which these players honoured the mother of the
gods, in presence of a vast assemblage and audience of both
sexes, they could not for very shame have rehearsed at home
in presence of their own mothers. And the crowds that were
gathered from all quarters by curiosity, offended modesty
must, I should suppose, have scattered in the confusion of
shame. If these are sacred rites, what is sacrilege? If this
is purification, what is pollution? This festivity was called
the Tables,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> as if a banquet were being given at which unclean
devils might find suitable refreshment. For it is not difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to see what kind of spirits they must be who are delighted
with such obscenities, unless, indeed, a man be blinded by
these evil spirits passing themselves off under the name of
gods, and either disbelieves in their existence, or leads such a
life as prompts him rather to propitiate and fear them than the
true God.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the obscenities practised in honour of the mother of the gods.</i></p>

<p>In this matter I would prefer to have as my assessors in
judgment, not those men who rather take pleasure in these
infamous customs than take pains to put an end to them, but
that same Scipio Nasica who was chosen by the senate as
the citizen most worthy to receive in his hands the image of
that demon Cybele, and convey it into the city. He would
tell us whether he would be proud to see his own mother
so highly esteemed by the state as to have divine honours
adjudged to her; as the Greeks and Romans and other nations
have decreed divine honours to men who had been of material
service to them, and have believed that their mortal benefactors
were thus made immortal, and enrolled among the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Surely he would desire that his mother should enjoy
such felicity were it possible. But if we proceeded to ask
him whether, among the honours paid to her, he would wish
such shameful rites as these to be celebrated, would he not at
once exclaim that he would rather his mother lay stone-dead,
than survive as a goddess to lend her ear to these obscenities?
Is it possible that he who was of so severe a morality, that
he used his influence as a Roman senator to prevent the
building of a theatre in that city dedicated to the manly
virtues, would wish his mother to be propitiated as a goddess
with words which would have brought the blush to her cheek
when a Roman matron? Could he possibly believe that the
modesty of an estimable woman would be so transformed by
her promotion to divinity, that she would suffer herself to be
invoked and celebrated in terms so gross and immodest, that
if she had heard the like while alive upon earth, and had
listened without stopping her ears and hurrying from the
spot, her relatives, her husband, and her children would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
blushed for her? Therefore, the mother of the gods being
such a character as the most profligate man would be ashamed
to have for his mother, and meaning to enthral the minds of
the Romans, demanded for her service their best citizen, not
to ripen him still more in virtue by her helpful counsel, but
to entangle him by her deceit, like her of whom it is written,
"The adulteress will hunt for the precious soul."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Her intent
was to puff up this high-souled man by an apparently divine
testimony to his excellence, in order that he might rely upon
his own eminence in virtue, and make no further efforts after
true piety and religion, without which natural genius, however
brilliant, vapours into pride and comes to nothing. For what
but a guileful purpose could that goddess demand the best
man, seeing that in her own sacred festivals she requires such
obscenities as the best men would be covered with shame to
hear at their own tables?</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That the gods of the pagans never inculcated holiness of life.</i></p>

<p>This is the reason why those divinities quite neglected the
lives and morals of the cities and nations who worshipped
them, and threw no dreadful prohibition in their way to
hinder them from becoming utterly corrupt, and to preserve
them from those terrible and detestable evils which visit not
harvests and vintages, not house and possessions, not the body
which is subject to the soul, but the soul itself, the spirit that
rules the whole man. If there was any such prohibition, let
it be produced, let it be proved. They will tell us that purity
and probity were inculcated upon those who were initiated in
the mysteries of religion, and that secret incitements to virtue
were whispered in the ear of the <i>élite</i>; but this is an idle
boast. Let them show or name to us the places which were
at any time consecrated to assemblages in which, instead of
the obscene songs and licentious acting of players, instead of
the celebration of those most filthy and shameless Fugalia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
(well called Fugalia, since they banish modesty and right
feeling), the people were commanded in the name of the gods
to restrain avarice, bridle impurity, and conquer ambition;
where, in short, they might learn in that school which Persius
vehemently lashes them to, when he says: "Be taught, ye
abandoned creatures, and ascertain the causes of things; what
we are, and for what end we are born; what is the law of
our success in life, and by what art we may turn the goal
without making shipwreck; what limit we should put to our
wealth, what we may lawfully desire, and what uses filthy
lucre serves; how much we should bestow upon our country
and our family; learn, in short, what God meant thee to be,
and what place He has ordered you to fill."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Let them name
to us the places where such instructions were wont to be
communicated from the gods, and where the people who worshipped
them were accustomed to resort to hear them, as we
can point to our churches built for this purpose in every land
where the Christian religion is received.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>7. <i>That the suggestions of philosophers are precluded from having any moral
effect, because they have not the authority which belongs to divine instruction,
and because man's natural bias to evil induces him rather to follow
the examples of the gods than to obey the precepts of men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But will they perhaps remind us of the schools of the
philosophers, and their disputations? In the first place, these
belong not to Rome, but to Greece; and even if we yield to
them that they are now Roman, because Greece itself has
become a Roman province, still the teachings of the philosophers
are not the commandments of the gods, but the discoveries
of men, who, at the prompting of their own speculative
ability, made efforts to discover the hidden laws of nature, and
the right and wrong in ethics, and in dialectic what was consequent
according to the rules of logic, and what was inconsequent
and erroneous. And some of them, by God's help,
made great discoveries; but when left to themselves they
were betrayed by human infirmity, and fell into mistakes. And
this was ordered by divine providence, that their pride might
be restrained, and that by their example it might be pointed
out that it is humility which has access to the highest regions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
But of this we shall have more to say, if the Lord God of
truth permit, in its own place.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> However, if the philosophers
have made any discoveries which are sufficient to guide men
to virtue and blessedness, would it not have been greater
justice to vote divine honours to them? Were it not more
accordant with every virtuous sentiment to read Plato's writings
in a "Temple of Plato," than to be present in the temples
of devils to witness the priests of Cybele<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> mutilating themselves,
the effeminate being consecrated, the raving fanatics
cutting themselves, and whatever other cruel or shameful, or
shamefully cruel or cruelly shameful, ceremony is enjoined by
the ritual of such gods as these? Were it not a more suitable
education, and more likely to prompt the youth to virtue, if
they heard public recitals of the laws of the gods, instead of
the vain laudation of the customs and laws of their ancestors?
Certainly all the worshippers of the Roman gods, when once
they are possessed by what Persius calls "the burning poison
of lust,"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> prefer to witness the deeds of Jupiter rather than to
hear what Plato taught or Cato censured. Hence the young
profligate in Terence, when he sees on the wall a fresco representing
the fabled descent of Jupiter into the lap of Danaë
in the form of a golden shower, accepts this as authoritative
precedent for his own licentiousness, and boasts that he is an
imitator of God. "And what God?" he says. "He who
with His thunder shakes the loftiest temples. And was I, a
poor creature compared to Him, to make bones of it? No;
I did it, and with all my heart."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">8. <i>That the theatrical exhibitions publishing the shameful actions of the gods,
propitiated rather than offended them.</i></p>

<p>But, some one will interpose, these are the fables of poets,
not the deliverances of the gods themselves. Well, I have
no mind to arbitrate between the lewdness of theatrical entertainments
and of mystic rites; only this I say, and history
bears me out in making the assertion, that those same entertainments,
in which the fictions of poets are the main attraction,
were not introduced in the festivals of the gods by the
ignorant devotion of the Romans, but that the gods themselves
gave the most urgent commands to this effect, and indeed extorted
from the Romans these solemnities and celebrations in
their honour. I touched on this in the preceding book, and
mentioned that dramatic entertainments were first inaugurated
at Rome on occasion of a pestilence, and by authority of the
pontiff. And what man is there who is not more likely to
adopt, for the regulation of his own life, the examples that are
represented in plays which have a divine sanction, rather than
the precepts written and promulgated with no more than
human authority? If the poets gave a false representation
of Jove in describing him as adulterous, then it were to be expected
that the chaste gods should in anger avenge so wicked
a fiction, in place of encouraging the games which circulated
it. Of these plays, the most inoffensive are comedies and
tragedies, that is to say, the dramas which poets write for
the stage, and which, though they often handle impure subjects,
yet do so without the filthiness of language which characterizes
many other performances; and it is these dramas which
boys are obliged by their seniors to read and learn as a part
of what is called a liberal and gentlemanly education.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>


<p class="center">9. <i>That the poetical licence which the Greeks, in obedience to their gods, allowed,
was restrained by the ancient Romans.</i></p>

<p>The opinion of the ancient Romans on this matter is
attested by Cicero in his work <i>De Republica</i>, in which Scipio,
one of the interlocutors, says, "The lewdness of comedy could
never have been suffered by audiences, unless the customs of
society had previously sanctioned the same lewdness." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in the earlier days the Greeks preserved a certain reasonableness
in their licence, and made it a law, that whatever comedy
wished to say of any one, it must say it of him by name.
And so in the same work of Cicero's, Scipio says, "Whom
has it not aspersed? Nay, whom has it not worried? Whom
has it spared? Allow that it may assail demagogues and
factions, men injurious to the commonwealth&mdash;a Cleon, a Cleophon,
a Hyperbolus. That is tolerable, though it had been
more seemly for the public censor to brand such men, than
for a poet to lampoon them; but to blacken the fame of
Pericles with scurrilous verse, after he had with the utmost
dignity presided over their state alike in war and in peace,
was as unworthy of a poet, as if our own Plautus or Nævius
were to bring Publius and Cneius Scipio on the comic stage, or
as if Cæcilius were to caricature Cato." And then a little after
he goes on: "Though our Twelve Tables attached the penalty
of death only to a very few offences, yet among these few this
was one: if any man should have sung a pasquinade, or have
composed a satire calculated to bring infamy or disgrace on
another person. Wisely decreed. For it is by the decisions
of magistrates, and by a well-informed justice, that our lives
ought to be judged, and not by the flighty fancies of poets;
neither ought we to be exposed to hear calumnies, save where
we have the liberty of replying, and defending ourselves before
an adequate tribunal." This much I have judged it advisable
to quote from the fourth book of Cicero's <i>De Republica</i>; and
I have made the quotation word for word, with the exception
of some words omitted, and some slightly transposed, for the
sake of giving the sense more readily. And certainly the
extract is pertinent to the matter I am endeavouring to explain.
Cicero makes some further remarks, and concludes
the passage by showing that the ancient Romans did not
permit any living man to be either praised or blamed on the
stage. But the Greeks, as I said, though not so moral, were
more logical in allowing this licence which the Romans forbade:
for they saw that their gods approved and enjoyed the
scurrilous language of low comedy when directed not only
against men, but even against themselves; and this, whether
the infamous actions imputed to them were the fictions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
poets, or were their actual iniquities commemorated and acted
in the theatres. And would that the spectators had judged
them worthy only of laughter, and not of imitation! Manifestly
it had been a stretch of pride to spare the good name
of the leading men and the common citizens, when the very
deities did not grudge that their own reputation should be
blemished.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>That the devils, in suffering either false or true crimes to be laid to their
charge, meant to do men a mischief.</i></p>

<p>It is alleged, in excuse of this practice, that the stories told
of the gods are not true, but false, and mere inventions; but
this only makes matters worse, if we form our estimate by
the morality our religion teaches; and if we consider the
malice of the devils, what more wily and astute artifice could
they practise upon men? When a slander is uttered against
a leading statesman of upright and useful life, is it not reprehensible
in proportion to its untruth and groundlessness?
What punishment, then, shall be sufficient when the gods are
the objects of so wicked and outrageous an injustice? But
the devils, whom these men repute gods, are content that even
iniquities they are guiltless of should be ascribed to them, so
long as they may entangle men's minds in the meshes of these
opinions, and draw them on along with themselves to their
predestinated punishment: whether such things were actually
committed by the men whom these devils, delighting in
human infatuation, cause to be worshipped as gods, and in
whose stead they, by a thousand malign and deceitful artifices,
substitute themselves, and so receive worship; or whether,
though they were really the crimes of men, these wicked
spirits gladly allowed them to be attributed to higher beings,
that there might seem to be conveyed from heaven itself a
sufficient sanction for the perpetration of shameful wickedness.
The Greeks, therefore, seeing the character of the gods they
served, thought that the poets should certainly not refrain
from showing up human vices on the stage, either because
they desired to be like their gods in this, or because they were
afraid that, if they required for themselves a more unblemished
reputation than they asserted for the gods, they might provoke
them to anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>11. <i>That the Greeks admitted players to offices of state, on the ground that men
who pleased the gods should not be contemptuously treated by their fellows</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a part of this same reasonableness of the Greeks
which induced them to bestow upon the actors of these same
plays no inconsiderable civic honours. In the above-mentioned
book of the <i>De Republica</i>, it is mentioned that Æschines,
a very eloquent Athenian, who had been a tragic actor in his
youth, became a statesman, and that the Athenians again and
again sent another tragedian, Aristodemus, as their plenipotentiary
to Philip. For they judged it unbecoming to condemn
and treat as infamous persons those who were the chief
actors in the scenic entertainments which they saw to be so
pleasing to the gods. No doubt this was immoral of the
Greeks, but there can be as little doubt they acted in conformity
with the character of their gods; for how could they
have presumed to protect the conduct of the citizens from
being cut to pieces by the tongues of poets and players, who
were allowed, and even enjoined by the gods, to tear their
divine reputation to tatters? And how could they hold in
contempt the men who acted in the theatres those dramas
which, as they had ascertained, gave pleasure to the gods
whom they worshipped? Nay, how could they but grant to
them the highest civic honours? On what plea could they
honour the priests who offered for them acceptable sacrifices
to the gods, if they branded with infamy the actors who in
behalf of the people gave to the gods that pleasure or honour
which they demanded, and which, according to the account of
the priests, they were angry at not receiving? Labeo,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> whose
learning makes him an authority on such points, is of opinion
that the distinction between good and evil deities should find
expression in a difference of worship; that the evil should be
propitiated by bloody sacrifices and doleful rites, but the good
with a joyful and pleasant observance, as, <i>e.g.</i> (as he says himself),
with plays, festivals, and banquets.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> All this we shall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
with God's help, hereafter discuss. At present, and speaking
to the subject on hand, whether all kinds of offerings are made
indiscriminately to all the gods, as if all were good (and it is
an unseemly thing to conceive that there are evil gods; but
these gods of the pagans are all evil, because they are not gods,
but evil spirits), or whether, as Labeo thinks, a distinction is
made between the offerings presented to the different gods,
the Greeks are equally justified in honouring alike the priests
by whom the sacrifices are offered, and the players by whom
the dramas are acted, that they may not be open to the charge
of doing an injury to all their gods, if the plays are pleasing
to all of them, or (which were still worse) to their good gods,
if the plays are relished only by them.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>12. <i>That the Romans, by refusing to the poets the same licence in respect of men
which they allowed them in the case of the gods, showed a more delicate
sensitiveness regarding themselves than regarding the gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Romans, however, as Scipio boasts in that same discussion,
declined having their conduct and good name subjected
to the assaults and slanders of the poets, and went so far as
to make it a capital crime if any one should dare to compose
such verses. This was a very honourable course to pursue, so
far as they themselves were concerned, but in respect of the
gods it was proud and irreligious: for they knew that the
gods not only tolerated, but relished, being lashed by the injurious
expressions of the poets, and yet they themselves would
not suffer this same handling; and what their ritual prescribed
as acceptable to the gods, their law prohibited as injurious to
themselves. How then, Scipio, do you praise the Romans for
refusing this licence to the poets, so that no citizen could be
calumniated, while you know that the gods were not included
under this protection? Do you count your senate-house
worthy of so much higher a regard than the Capitol? Is the
one city of Rome more valuable in your eyes than the whole
heaven of gods, that you prohibit your poets from uttering
any injurious words against a citizen, though they may with
impunity cast what imputations they please upon the gods,
without the interference of senator, censor, prince, or pontiff?
It was, forsooth, intolerable that Plautus or Nævius should
attack Publius and Cneius Scipio, insufferable that Cæcilius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
should lampoon Cato; but quite proper that your Terence
should encourage youthful lust by the wicked example of
supreme Jove.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>13. <i>That the Romans should have understood that gods who desired to be worshipped
in licentious entertainments were unworthy of divine honour.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But Scipio, were he alive, would possibly reply: "How
could we attach a penalty to that which the gods themselves
have consecrated? For the theatrical entertainments in which
such things are said, and acted, and performed, were introduced
into Roman society by the gods, who ordered that they
should be dedicated and exhibited in their honour." But was
not this, then, the plainest proof that they were no true gods,
nor in any respect worthy of receiving divine honours from
the republic? Suppose they had required that in their
honour the citizens of Rome should be held up to ridicule,
every Roman would have resented the hateful proposal. How
then, I would ask, can they be esteemed worthy of worship,
when they propose that their own crimes be used as material
for celebrating their praises? Does not this artifice expose
them, and prove that they are detestable devils? Thus the
Romans, though they were superstitious enough to serve as
gods those who made no secret of their desire to be worshipped
in licentious plays, yet had sufficient regard to their hereditary
dignity and virtue, to prompt them to refuse to players any
such rewards as the Greeks accorded them. On this point
we have this testimony of Scipio, recorded in Cicero: "They
[the Romans] considered comedy and all theatrical performances
as disgraceful, and therefore not only debarred players
from offices and honours open to ordinary citizens, but also
decreed that their names should be branded by the censor, and
erased from the roll of their tribe." An excellent decree, and
another testimony to the sagacity of Rome; but I could wish
their prudence had been more thoroughgoing and consistent.
For when I hear that if any Roman citizen chose the stage as
his profession, he not only closed to himself every laudable
career, but even became an outcast from his own tribe, I cannot
but exclaim: This is the true Roman spirit, this is worthy of
a state jealous of its reputation. But then some one interrupts
my rapture, by inquiring with what consistency players are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
debarred from all honours, while plays are counted among the
honours due to the gods? For a long while the virtue of
Rome was uncontaminated by theatrical exhibitions;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and if
they had been adopted for the sake of gratifying the taste of
the citizens, they would have been introduced hand in hand
with the relaxation of manners. But the fact is, that it was
the gods who demanded that they should be exhibited to
gratify them. With what justice, then, is the player excommunicated
by whom God is worshipped? On what pretext
can you at once adore him who exacts, and brand him who
acts these plays? This, then, is the controversy in which the
Greeks and Romans are engaged. The Greeks think they
justly honour players, because they worship the gods who
demand plays: the Romans, on the other hand, do not suffer
an actor to disgrace by his name his own plebeian tribe, far
less the senatorial order. And the whole of this discussion
may be summed up in the following syllogism. The Greeks
give us the major premiss: If such gods are to be worshipped,
then certainly such men may be honoured. The Romans add
the minor: But such men must by no means be honoured.
The Christians draw the conclusion: Therefore such gods must
by no means be worshipped.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap14"></a>14. <i>That Plato, who excluded poets from a well-ordered city, was better than
these gods who desire to be honoured by theatrical plays.</i></p>

<p>We have still to inquire why the poets who write the
plays, and who by the law of the twelve tables are prohibited
from injuring the good name of the citizens, are reckoned more
estimable than the actors, though they so shamefully asperse
the character of the gods? Is it right that the actors of these
poetical and God-dishonouring effusions be branded, while
their authors are honoured? Must we not here award the
palm to a Greek, Plato, who, in framing his ideal republic,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
conceived that poets should be banished from the city as
enemies of the state? He could not brook that the gods be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
brought into disrepute, nor that the minds of the citizens be
depraved and besotted, by the fictions of the poets. Compare
now human nature as you see it in Plato, expelling poets
from the city that the citizens be uninjured, with the divine
nature as you see it in these gods exacting plays in their
own honour. Plato strove, though unsuccessfully, to persuade
the light-minded and lascivious Greeks to abstain from so
much as writing such plays; the gods used their authority to
extort the acting of the same from the dignified and sober-minded
Romans. And not content with having them acted,
they had them dedicated to themselves, consecrated to themselves,
solemnly celebrated in their own honour. To which,
then, would it be more becoming in a state to decree divine
honours,&mdash;to Plato, who prohibited these wicked and licentious
plays, or to the demons who delighted in blinding men to the
truth of what Plato unsuccessfully sought to inculcate?</p>

<p>This philosopher, Plato, has been elevated by Labeo to the
rank of a demigod, and set thus upon a level with such as
Hercules and Romulus. Labeo ranks demigods higher than
heroes, but both he counts among the deities. But I have no
doubt that he thinks this man whom he reckons a demigod
worthy of greater respect not only than the heroes, but also
than the gods themselves. The laws of the Romans and the
speculations of Plato have this resemblance, that the latter
pronounces a wholesale condemnation of poetical fictions,
while the former restrain the licence of satire, at least so far
as men are the objects of it. Plato will not suffer poets
even to dwell in his city: the laws of Rome prohibit actors
from being enrolled as citizens; and if they had not feared to
offend the gods who had asked the services of the players, they
would in all likelihood have banished them altogether. It is
obvious, therefore, that the Romans could not receive, nor
reasonably expect to receive, laws for the regulation of their
conduct from their gods, since the laws they themselves enacted
far surpassed and put to shame the morality of the gods. The
gods demand stage-plays in their own honour; the Romans
exclude the players from all civic honours:<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> the former
commanded that they should be celebrated by the scenic representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of their own disgrace; the latter commanded that
no poet should dare to blemish the reputation of any citizen.
But that demigod Plato resisted the lust of such gods as
these, and showed the Romans what their genius had left
incomplete; for he absolutely excluded poets from his ideal
state, whether they composed fictions with no regard to truth,
or set the worst possible examples before wretched men
under the guise of divine actions. We for our part, indeed,
reckon Plato neither a god nor a demigod; we would not
even compare him to any of God's holy angels, nor to the
truth-speaking prophets, nor to any of the apostles or martyrs
of Christ, nay, not to any faithful Christian man. The reason
of this opinion of ours we will, God prospering us, render in
its own place. Nevertheless, since they wish him to be considered
a demigod, we think he certainly is more entitled
to that rank, and is every way superior, if not to Hercules
and Romulus (though no historian could ever narrate nor any
poet sing of him that he had killed his brother, or committed
any crime), yet certainly to Priapus, or a Cynocephalus,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> or
the Fever,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>&mdash;divinities whom the Romans have partly received
from foreigners, and partly consecrated by home-grown rites.
How, then, could gods such as these be expected to promulgate
good and wholesome laws, either for the prevention of moral
and social evils, or for their eradication where they had already
sprung up?&mdash;gods who used their influence even to sow and
cherish profligacy, by appointing that deeds truly or falsely
ascribed to them should be published to the people by means
of theatrical exhibitions, and by thus gratuitously fanning the
flame of human lust with the breath of a seemingly divine
approbation. In vain does Cicero, speaking of poets, exclaim
against this state of things in these words: "When the
plaudits and acclamation of the people, who sit as infallible
judges, are won by the poets, what darkness benights the
mind, what fears invade, what passions inflame it!"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p class="center">15. <i>That it was vanity, not reason, which created some of the Roman gods.</i></p>

<p>But is it not manifest that vanity rather than reason regulated
the choice of some of their false gods? This Plato,
whom they reckon a demigod, and who used all his eloquence
to preserve men from the most dangerous spiritual calamities,
has yet not been counted worthy even of a little shrine; but
Romulus, because they can call him their own, they have
esteemed more highly than many gods, though their secret doctrine
can allow him the rank only of a demigod. To him they
allotted a flamen, that is to say, a priest of a class so highly
esteemed in their religion (distinguished, too, by their conical
mitres), that for only three of their gods were flamens appointed&mdash;the
Flamen Dialis for Jupiter, Martialis for Mars, and Quirinalis
for Romulus (for when the ardour of his fellow-citizens
had given Romulus a seat among the gods, they gave him this
new name Quirinus). And thus by this honour Romulus has
been preferred to Neptune and Pluto, Jupiter's brothers, and
to Saturn himself, their father. They have assigned the same
priesthood to serve him as to serve Jove; and in giving Mars
(the reputed father of Romulus) the same honour, is this
not rather for Romulus' sake than to honour Mars?</p>

<p>16. <i>That if the gods had really possessed any regard for righteousness, the
Romans should have received good laws from them, instead of having to
borrow them from other nations.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, if the Romans had been able to receive a rule of
life from their gods, they would not have borrowed Solon's
laws from the Athenians, as they did some years after Rome
was founded; and yet they did not keep them as they
received them, but endeavoured to improve and amend them.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Although Lycurgus pretended that he was authorized by
Apollo to give laws to the Lacedemonians, the sensible
Romans did not choose to believe this, and were not induced
to borrow laws from Sparta. Numa Pompilius, who succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Romulus in the kingdom, is said to have framed some laws,
which, however, were not sufficient for the regulation of civic
affairs. Among these regulations were many pertaining to
religious observances, and yet he is not reported to have
received even these from the gods. With respect, then, to
moral evils, evils of life and conduct,&mdash;evils which are so
mighty, that, according to the wisest pagans,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> by them states
are ruined while their cities stand uninjured,&mdash;their gods
made not the smallest provision for preserving their worshippers
from these evils, but, on the contrary, took special pains
to increase them, as we have previously endeavoured to prove.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the rape of the Sabine women, and other iniquities perpetrated in Rome's
palmiest days.</i></p>

<p>But possibly we are to find the reason for this neglect of
the Romans by their gods, in the saying of Sallust, that
"equity and virtue prevailed among the Romans not more by
force of laws than of nature."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> I presume it is to this inborn
equity and goodness of disposition we are to ascribe the rape
of the Sabine women. What, indeed, could be more equitable
and virtuous, than to carry off by force, as each man was
fit, and without their parents' consent, girls who were strangers
and guests, and who had been decoyed and entrapped by the
pretence of a spectacle! If the Sabines were wrong to deny
their daughters when the Romans asked for them, was it not
a greater wrong in the Romans to carry them off after that
denial? The Romans might more justly have waged war
against the neighbouring nation for having refused their
daughters in marriage when they first sought them, than for
having demanded them back when they had stolen them.
War should have been proclaimed at first: it was then that
Mars should have helped his warlike son, that he might by
force of arms avenge the injury done him by the refusal of
marriage, and might also thus win the women he desired.
There might have been some appearance of "right of war" in
a victor carrying off, in virtue of this right, the virgins who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
had been without any show of right denied him; whereas
there was no "right of peace" entitling him to carry off those
who were not given to him, and to wage an unjust war with
their justly enraged parents. One happy circumstance was
indeed connected with this act of violence, viz., that though
it was commemorated by the games of the circus, yet even
this did not constitute it a precedent in the city or realm of
Rome. If one would find fault with the results of this act, it
must rather be on the ground that the Romans made Romulus
a god in spite of his perpetrating this iniquity; for one cannot
reproach them with making this deed any kind of precedent
for the rape of women.</p>

<p>Again, I presume it was due to this natural equity and
virtue, that after the expulsion of King Tarquin, whose son had
violated Lucretia, Junius Brutus the consul forced Lucius
Tarquinius Collatinus, Lucretia's husband and his own colleague,
a good and innocent man, to resign his office and go
into banishment, on the one sole charge that he was of the
name and blood of the Tarquins. This injustice was perpetrated
with the approval, or at least connivance, of the
people, who had themselves raised to the consular office both
Collatinus and Brutus. Another instance of this equity and
virtue is found in their treatment of Marcus Camillus. This
eminent man, after he had rapidly conquered the Veians, at
that time the most formidable of Rome's enemies, and who
had maintained a ten years' war, in which the Roman army had
suffered the usual calamities attendant on bad generalship,
after he had restored security to Rome, which had begun to
tremble for its safety, and after he had taken the wealthiest
city of the enemy, had charges brought against him by the
malice of those that envied his success, and by the insolence
of the tribunes of the people; and seeing that the city bore
him no gratitude for preserving it, and that he would
certainly be condemned, he went into exile, and even in his
absence was fined 10,000 asses. Shortly after, however, his
ungrateful country had again to seek his protection from the
Gauls. But I cannot now mention all the shameful and
iniquitous acts with which Rome was agitated, when the
aristocracy attempted to subject the people, and the people
resented their encroachments, and the advocates of either party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
were actuated rather by the love of victory than by any equitable
or virtuous consideration.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>18. <i>What the history of Sallust reveals regarding the life of the Romans, either
when straitened by anxiety or relaxed in security.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I will therefore pause, and adduce the testimony of Sallust
himself, whose words in praise of the Romans (that "equity
and virtue prevailed among them not more by force of laws
than of nature") have given occasion to this discussion. He
was referring to that period immediately after the expulsion
of the kings, in which the city became great in an incredibly
short space of time. And yet this same writer acknowledges
in the first book of his history, in the very exordium of his
work, that even at that time, when a very brief interval
had elapsed after the government had passed from kings to
consuls, the more powerful men began to act unjustly, and
occasioned the defection of the people from the patricians,
and other disorders in the city. For after Sallust had stated
that the Romans enjoyed greater harmony and a purer state
of society between the second and third Punic wars than at
any other time, and that the cause of this was not their love
of good order, but their fear lest the peace they had with
Carthage might be broken (this also, as we mentioned, Nasica
contemplated when he opposed the destruction of Carthage,
for he supposed that fear would tend to repress wickedness,
and to preserve wholesome ways of living), he then goes on to
say: "Yet, after the destruction of Carthage, discord, avarice,
ambition, and the other vices which are commonly generated
by prosperity, more than ever increased." If they "increased,"
and that "more than ever," then already they had appeared,
and had been increasing. And so Sallust adds this reason for
what he said. "For," he says, "the oppressive measures of
the powerful, and the consequent secessions of the plebs from
the patricians, and other civil dissensions, had existed from
the first, and affairs were administered with equity and well-tempered
justice for no longer a period than the short time
after the expulsion of the kings, while the city was occupied
with the serious Tuscan war and Tarquin's vengeance." You
see how, even in that brief period after the expulsion of the
kings, fear, he acknowledges, was the cause of the interval of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
equity and good order. They were afraid, in fact, of the war
which Tarquin waged against them, after he had been driven
from the throne and the city, and had allied himself with the
Tuscans. But observe what he adds: "After that, the patricians
treated the people as their slaves, ordering them to be
scourged or beheaded just as the kings had done, driving
them from their holdings, and harshly tyrannizing over those
who had no property to lose. The people, overwhelmed by
these oppressive measures, and most of all by exorbitant
usury, and obliged to contribute both money and personal
service to the constant wars, at length took arms, and seceded
to Mount Aventine and Mount Sacer, and thus obtained for
themselves tribunes and protective laws. But it was only the
second Punic war that put an end on both sides to discord
and strife." You see what kind of men the Romans were,
even so early as a few years after the expulsion of the kings;
and it is of these men he says, that "equity and virtue prevailed
among them not more by force of law than of nature."</p>

<p>Now, if these were the days in which the Roman republic
shows fairest and best, what are we to say or think of the
succeeding age, when, to use the words of the same historian,
"changing little by little from the fair and virtuous city it
was, it became utterly wicked and dissolute?" This was, as he
mentions, after the destruction of Carthage. Sallust's brief
sum and sketch of this period may be read in his own history,
in which he shows how the profligate manners which were
propagated by prosperity resulted at last even in civil wars.
He says: "And from this time the primitive manners, instead
of undergoing an insensible alteration as hitherto they had
done, were swept away as by a torrent: the young men were
so depraved by luxury and avarice, that it may justly be said
that no father had a son who could either preserve his own
patrimony, or keep his hands off other men's." Sallust
adds a number of particulars about the vices of Sylla, and
the debased condition of the republic in general; and other
writers make similar observations, though in much less striking
language.</p>

<p>However, I suppose you now see, or at least any one who
gives his attention has the means of seeing, in what a sink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of iniquity that city was plunged before the advent of our
heavenly King. For these things happened not only before
Christ had begun to teach, but before He was even born of
the Virgin. If, then, they dare not impute to their gods the
grievous evils of those former times, more tolerable before the
destruction of Carthage, but intolerable and dreadful after it,
although it was the gods who by their malign craft instilled
into the minds of men the conceptions from which such
dreadful vices branched out on all sides, why do they impute
these present calamities to Christ, who teaches life-giving truth,
and forbids us to worship false and deceitful gods, and who,
abominating and condemning with His divine authority those
wicked and hurtful lusts of men, gradually withdraws His
own people from a world that is corrupted by these vices,
and is falling into ruins, to make of them an eternal city,
whose glory rests not on the acclamations of vanity, but on
the judgment of truth?</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the corruption which had grown upon the Roman republic before Christ
abolished the worship of the gods.</i></p>

<p>Here, then, is this Roman republic, "which has changed
little by little from the fair and virtuous city it was, and has
become utterly wicked and dissolute." It is not I who am
the first to say this, but their own authors, from whom we
learned it for a fee, and who wrote it long before the coming
of Christ. You see how, before the coming of Christ, and
after the destruction of Carthage, "the primitive manners,
instead of undergoing insensible alteration, as hitherto they had
done, were swept away as by a torrent; and how depraved
by luxury and avarice the youth were." Let them now, on
their part, read to us any laws given by their gods to the
Roman people, and directed against luxury and avarice. And
would that they had only been silent on the subjects of
chastity and modesty, and had not demanded from the people
indecent and shameful practices, to which they lent a pernicious
patronage by their so-called divinity. Let them
read our commandments in the Prophets, Gospels, Acts of
the Apostles, or Epistles; let them peruse the large number
of precepts against avarice and luxury which are everywhere
read to the congregations that meet for this purpose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
which strike the ear, not with the uncertain sound of a philosophical
discussion, but with the thunder of God's own oracle
pealing from the clouds. And yet they do not impute to their
gods the luxury and avarice, the cruel and dissolute manners,
that had rendered the republic utterly wicked and corrupt,
even before the coming of Christ; but whatever affliction
their pride and effeminacy have exposed them to in these
latter days, they furiously impute to our religion. If the
kings of the earth and all their subjects, if all princes and
judges of the earth, if young men and maidens, old and
young, every age, and both sexes; if they whom the Baptist
addressed, the publicans and the soldiers, were all together
to hearken to and observe the precepts of the Christian
religion regarding a just and virtuous life, then should the
republic adorn the whole earth with its own felicity, and
attain in life everlasting to the pinnacle of kingly glory.
But because this man listens, and that man scoffs, and most
are enamoured of the blandishments of vice rather than the
wholesome severity of virtue, the people of Christ, whatever
be their condition&mdash;whether they be kings, princes, judges,
soldiers, or provincials, rich or poor, bond or free, male or
female&mdash;are enjoined to endure this earthly republic, wicked
and dissolute as it is, that so they may by this endurance
win for themselves an eminent place in that most holy and
august assembly of angels and republic of heaven, in which
the will of God is the law.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the kind of happiness and life truly delighted in by those who inveigh
against the Christian religion.</i></p>

<p>But the worshippers and admirers of these gods delight in
imitating their scandalous iniquities, and are nowise concerned
that the republic be less depraved and licentious.
Only let it remain undefeated, they say, only let it flourish
and abound in resources; let it be glorious by its victories, or
still better, secure in peace; and what matters it to us?
This is our concern, that every man be able to increase his
wealth so as to supply his daily prodigalities, and so that the
powerful may subject the weak for their own purposes. Let
the poor court the rich for a living, and that under their protection
they may enjoy a sluggish tranquillity; and let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
rich abuse the poor as their dependants, to minister to their
pride. Let the people applaud not those who protect their
interests, but those who provide them with pleasure. Let no
severe duty be commanded, no impurity forbidden. Let kings
estimate their prosperity, not by the righteousness, but by the
servility of their subjects. Let the provinces stand loyal to
the kings, not as moral guides, but as lords of their possessions
and purveyors of their pleasures; not with a hearty
reverence, but a crooked and servile fear. Let the laws take
cognizance rather of the injury done to another man's property,
than of that done to one's own person. If a man be a
nuisance to his neighbour, or injure his property, family, or
person, let him be actionable; but in his own affairs let every
one with impunity do what he will in company with his own
family, and with those who willingly join him. Let there be
a plentiful supply of public prostitutes for every one who
wishes to use them, but specially for those who are too poor
to keep one for their private use. Let there be erected houses
of the largest and most ornate description: in these let there
be provided the most sumptuous banquets, where every one
who pleases may, by day or night, play, drink, vomit,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> dissipate.
Let there be everywhere heard the rustling of dancers,
the loud, immodest laughter of the theatre; let a succession of
the most cruel and the most voluptuous pleasures maintain a
perpetual excitement. If such happiness is distasteful to any,
let him be branded as a public enemy; and if any attempt to
modify or put an end to it, let him be silenced, banished, put
an end to. Let these be reckoned the true gods, who procure
for the people this condition of things, and preserve it when
once possessed. Let them be worshipped as they wish; let
them demand whatever games they please, from or with their
own worshippers; only let them secure that such felicity be
not imperilled by foe, plague, or disaster of any kind. What
sane man would compare a republic such as this, I will not
say to the Roman empire, but to the palace of Sardanapalus,
the ancient king who was so abandoned to pleasures, that he
caused it to be inscribed on his tomb, that now that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
dead, he possessed only those things which he had swallowed
and consumed by his appetites while alive? If these men
had such a king as this, who, while self-indulgent, should lay
no severe restraint on them, they would more enthusiastically
consecrate to him a temple and a flamen than the ancient
Romans did to Romulus.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap221"></a>21. <i>Cicero's opinion of the Roman republic.</i></p>

<p>But if our adversaries do not care how foully and disgracefully
the Roman republic be stained by corrupt practices, so
long only as it holds together and continues in being, and
if they therefore pooh-pooh the testimony of Sallust to its
"utterly wicked and profligate" condition, what will they
make of Cicero's statement, that even in his time it had
become entirely extinct, and that there remained extant no
Roman republic at all? He introduces Scipio (the Scipio
who had destroyed Carthage) discussing the republic, at a time
when already there were presentiments of its speedy ruin by
that corruption which Sallust describes. In fact, at the time
when the discussion took place, one of the Gracchi, who,
according to Sallust, was the first great instigator of seditions,
had already been put to death. His death, indeed, is mentioned
in the same book. Now Scipio, in the end of the
second book, says: "As, among the different sounds which proceed
from lyres, flutes, and the human voice, there must be
maintained a certain harmony which a cultivated ear cannot
endure to hear disturbed or jarring, but which may be elicited
in full and absolute concord by the modulation even of voices
very unlike one another; so, where reason is allowed to
modulate the diverse elements of the state, there is obtained a
perfect concord from the upper, lower, and middle classes as
from various sounds; and what musicians call harmony in
singing, is concord in matters of state, which is the strictest
bond and best security of any republic, and which by no
ingenuity can be retained where justice has become extinct."
Then, when he had expatiated somewhat more fully, and had
more copiously illustrated the benefits of its presence and the
ruinous effects of its absence upon a state, Pilus, one of the
company present at the discussion, struck in and demanded
that the question should be more thoroughly sifted, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the subject of justice should be freely discussed for the sake
of ascertaining what truth there was in the maxim which was
then becoming daily more current, that "the republic cannot
be governed without injustice." Scipio expressed his willingness
to have this maxim discussed and sifted, and gave it as
his opinion that it was baseless, and that no progress could be
made in discussing the republic unless it was established, not
only that this maxim, that "the republic cannot be governed
without injustice," was false, but also that the truth is, that it
cannot be governed without the most absolute justice. And
the discussion of this question, being deferred till the next
day, is carried on in the third book with great animation.
For Pilus himself undertook to defend the position that the
republic cannot be governed without injustice, at the same
time being at special pains to clear himself of any real participation
in that opinion. He advocated with great keenness
the cause of injustice against justice, and endeavoured by
plausible reasons and examples to demonstrate that the former
is beneficial, the latter useless, to the republic. Then, at the
request of the company, Lælius attempted to defend justice,
and strained every nerve to prove that nothing is so hurtful
to a state as injustice; and that without justice a republic
can neither be governed, nor even continue to exist.</p>

<p>When this question has been handled to the satisfaction of
the company, Scipio reverts to the original thread of discourse,
and repeats with commendation his own brief definition of a
republic, that it is the weal of the people. "The people" he
defines as being not every assemblage or mob, but an assemblage
associated by a common acknowledgment of law, and by
a community of interests. Then he shows the use of definition
in debate; and from these definitions of his own he
gathers that a republic, or "weal of the people," then exists
only when it is well and justly governed, whether by a
monarch, or an aristocracy, or by the whole people. But
when the monarch is unjust, or, as the Greeks say, a tyrant;
or the aristocrats are unjust, and form a faction; or the
people themselves are unjust, and become, as Scipio for want
of a better name calls them, themselves the tyrant, then the
republic is not only blemished (as had been proved the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
before), but by legitimate deduction from those definitions, it
altogether ceases to be. For it could not be the people's weal
when a tyrant factiously lorded it over the state; neither
would the people be any longer a people if it were unjust,
since it would no longer answer the definition of a people&mdash;"an
assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of
law, and by a community of interests."</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Roman republic was such as Sallust
described it, it was not "utterly wicked and profligate," as
he says, but had altogether ceased to exist, if we are to admit
the reasoning of that debate maintained on the subject of
the republic by its best representatives. Tully himself, too,
speaking not in the person of Scipio or any one else, but
uttering his own sentiments, uses the following language in
the beginning of the fifth book, after quoting a line from the
poet Ennius, in which he said, "Rome's severe morality and
her citizens are her safeguard." "This verse," says Cicero,
"seems to me to have all the sententious truthfulness of an
oracle. For neither would the citizens have availed without
the morality of the community, nor would the morality of the
commons without outstanding men have availed either to
establish or so long to maintain in vigour so grand a republic
with so wide and just an empire. Accordingly, before our
day, the hereditary usages formed our foremost men, and they
on their part retained the usages and institutions of their
fathers. But our age, receiving the republic as a <i>chef-d'&#339;uvre</i>
of another age which has already begun to grow old, has not
merely neglected to restore the colours of the original, but has
not even been at the pains to preserve so much as the general
outline and most outstanding features. For what survives
of that primitive morality which the poet called Rome's safeguard?
It is so obsolete and forgotten, that, far from practising
it, one does not even know it. And of the citizens what
shall I say? Morality has perished through poverty of great
men; a poverty for which we must not only assign a reason,
but for the guilt of which we must answer as criminals charged
with a capital crime. For it is through our vices, and not by
any mishap, that we retain only the name of a republic, and
have long since lost the reality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the confession of Cicero, long indeed after the death
of Africanus, whom he introduced as an interlocutor in his
work <i>De Republica</i>, but still before the coming of Christ. Yet,
if the disasters he bewails had been lamented after the Christian
religion had been diffused, and had begun to prevail, is
there a man of our adversaries who would not have thought
that they were to be imputed to the Christians? Why, then,
did their gods not take steps then to prevent the decay and
extinction of that republic, over the loss of which Cicero, long
before Christ had come in the flesh, sings so lugubrious a
dirge? Its admirers have need to inquire whether, even in
the days of primitive men and morals, true justice flourished
in it; or was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression
of Cicero, rather a coloured painting than the living
reality? But, if God will, we shall consider this elsewhere.
For I mean in its own place to show that&mdash;according to the
definitions in which Cicero himself, using Scipio as his mouthpiece,
briefly propounded what a republic is, and what a
people is, and according to many testimonies, both of his own
lips and of those who took part in that same debate&mdash;Rome
never was a republic, because true justice had never a place
in it. But accepting the more feasible definitions of a republic,
I grant there was a republic of a certain kind, and certainly
much better administered by the more ancient Romans than
by their modern representatives. But the fact is, true justice
has no existence save in that republic whose founder and
ruler is Christ, if at least any choose to call this a republic;
and indeed we cannot deny that it is the people's weal. But
if perchance this name, which has become familiar in other
connections, be considered alien to our common parlance, we
may at all events say that in this city is true justice; the city
of which Holy Scripture says, "Glorious things are said of
thee, O city of God."</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>That the Roman gods never took any steps to prevent the republic from being
ruined by immorality.</i></p>

<p>But what is relevant to the present question is this, that
however admirable our adversaries say the republic was or is,
it is certain that by the testimony of their own most learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
writers it had become, long before the coming of Christ,
utterly wicked and dissolute, and indeed had no existence,
but had been destroyed by profligacy. To prevent this, surely
these guardian gods ought to have given precepts of morals
and a rule of life to the people by whom they were worshipped
in so many temples, with so great a variety of priests
and sacrifices, with such numberless and diverse rites, so
many festal solemnities, so many celebrations of magnificent
games. But in all this the demons only looked after their
own interest, and cared not at all how their worshippers lived,
or rather were at pains to induce them to lead an abandoned
life, so long as they paid these tributes to their honour, and
regarded them with fear. If any one denies this, let him
produce, let him point to, let him read the laws which the
gods had given against sedition, and which the Gracchi transgressed
when they threw everything into confusion; or those
Marius, and Cinna, and Carbo broke when they involved their
country in civil wars, most iniquitous and unjustifiable in their
causes, cruelly conducted, and yet more cruelly terminated; or
those which Sylla scorned, whose life, character, and deeds, as
described by Sallust and other historians, are the abhorrence
of all mankind. Who will deny that at that time the
republic had become extinct?</p>

<p>Possibly they will be bold enough to suggest in defence
of the gods, that they abandoned the city on account of the
profligacy of the citizens, according to the lines of Virgil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gone from each fane, each sacred shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are those who made this realm divine."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, firstly, if it be so, then they cannot complain against the
Christian religion, as if it were that which gave offence to
the gods and caused them to abandon Rome, since the Roman
immorality had long ago driven from the altars of the city a
cloud of little gods, like as many flies. And yet where was
this host of divinities, when, long before the corruption of the
primitive morality, Rome was taken and burnt by the Gauls?
Perhaps they were present, but asleep? For at that time the
whole city fell into the hands of the enemy, with the single
exception of the Capitoline hill; and this too would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
taken, had not&mdash;the watchful geese aroused the sleeping gods!
And this gave occasion to the festival of the goose, in which
Rome sank nearly to the superstition of the Egyptians, who
worship beasts and birds. But of these adventitious evils
which are inflicted by hostile armies or by some disaster, and
which attach rather to the body than the soul, I am not
meanwhile disputing. At present I speak of the decay of
morality, which at first almost imperceptibly lost its brilliant
hue, but afterwards was wholly obliterated, was swept away as
by a torrent, and involved the republic in such disastrous
ruin, that though the houses and walls remained standing,
the leading writers do not scruple to say that the republic
was destroyed. Now, the departure of the gods "from each
fane, each sacred shrine," and their abandonment of the city
to destruction, was an act of justice, if their laws inculcating
justice and a moral life had been held in contempt by that
city. But what kind of gods were these, pray, who declined
to live with a people who worshipped them, and whose
corrupt life they had done nothing to reform?</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>That the vicissitudes of this life are dependent not on the favour or hostility
of demons, but on the will of the true God.</i></p>

<p>But, further, is it not obvious that the gods have abetted the
fulfilment of men's desires, instead of authoritatively bridling
them? For Marius, a low-born and self-made man, who ruthlessly
provoked and conducted civil wars, was so effectually
aided by them, that he was seven times consul, and died
full of years in his seventh consulship, escaping the hands of
Sylla, who immediately afterwards came into power. Why,
then, did they not also aid him, so as to restrain him from so
many enormities? For if it is said that the gods had no
hand in his success, this is no trivial admission, that a man
can attain the dearly coveted felicity of this life even though
his own gods be not propitious; that men can be loaded with
the gifts of fortune as Marius was, can enjoy health, power,
wealth, honours, dignity, length of days, though the gods be
hostile to him; and that, on the other hand, men can be tormented
as Regulus was, with captivity, bondage, destitution,
watchings, pain, and cruel death, though the gods be his friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
To concede this is to make a compendious confession that the
gods are useless, and their worship superfluous. If the gods
have taught the people rather what goes clean counter to the
virtues of the soul, and that integrity of life which meets a
reward after death; if even in respect of temporal and transitory
blessings they neither hurt those whom they hate nor profit
whom they love, why are they worshipped, why are they invoked
with such eager homage? Why do men murmur in difficult
and sad emergencies, as if the gods had retired in anger? and
why, on their account, is the Christian religion injured by the
most unworthy calumnies? If in temporal matters they have
power either for good or for evil, why did they stand by Marius,
the worst of Rome's citizens, and abandon Regulus, the best?
Does this not prove themselves to be most unjust and wicked?
And even if it be supposed that for this very reason they are
the rather to be feared and worshipped, this is a mistake; for
we do not read that Regulus worshipped them less assiduously
than Marius. Neither is it apparent that a wicked life is to
be chosen, on the ground that the gods are supposed to have
favoured Marius more than Regulus. For Metellus, the
most highly esteemed of all the Romans, who had five sons
in the consulship, was prosperous even in this life; and
Catiline, the worst of men, reduced to poverty and defeated
in the war his own guilt had aroused, lived and perished
miserably. Real and secure felicity is the peculiar possession
of those who worship that God by whom alone it can be
conferred.</p>

<p>It is thus apparent, that when the republic was being
destroyed by profligate manners, its gods did nothing to
hinder its destruction by the direction or correction of its
manners, but rather accelerated its destruction by increasing
the demoralization and corruption that already existed. They
need not pretend that their goodness was shocked by the
iniquity of the city, and that they withdrew in anger. For
they were there, sure enough; they are detected, convicted:
they were equally unable to break silence so as to guide
others, and to keep silence so as to conceal themselves. I
do not dwell on the fact that the inhabitants of Minturnæ
took pity on Marius, and commended him to the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Marica in her grove, that she might give him success in
all things, and that from the abyss of despair in which he
then lay he forthwith returned unhurt to Rome, and entered
the city the ruthless leader of a ruthless army; and they
who wish to know how bloody was his victory, how unlike a
citizen, and how much more relentlessly than any foreign foe
he acted, let them read the histories. But this, as I said, I
do not dwell upon; nor do I attribute the bloody bliss of
Marius to, I know not what Minturnian goddess [Marica], but
rather to the secret providence of God, that the mouths of our
adversaries might be shut, and that they who are not led by
passion, but by prudent consideration of events, might be delivered
from error. And even if the demons have any power
in these matters, they have only that power which the secret
decree of the Almighty allots to them, in order that we may
not set too great store by earthly prosperity, seeing it is oftentimes
vouchsafed even to wicked men like Marius; and that
we may not, on the other hand, regard it as an evil, since
we see that many good and pious worshippers of the one true
God are, in spite of the demons, pre-eminently successful;
and, finally, that we may not suppose that these unclean
spirits are either to be propitiated or feared for the sake of
earthly blessings or calamities: for as wicked men on earth
cannot do all they would, so neither can these demons, but
only in so far as they are permitted by the decree of Him
whose judgments are fully comprehensible, justly reprehensible
by none.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the deeds of Sylla, in which the demons boasted that he had their help.</i></p>

<p>It is certain that Sylla&mdash;whose rule was so cruel, that, in
comparison with it, the preceding state of things which he
came to avenge was regretted&mdash;when first he advanced towards
Rome to give battle to Marius, found the auspices so favourable
when he sacrificed, that, according to Livy's account, the
augur Postumius expressed his willingness to lose his head if
Sylla did not, with the help of the gods, accomplish what he
designed. The gods, you see, had not departed from "every
fane and sacred shrine," since they were still predicting the
issue of these affairs, and yet were taking no steps to correct
Sylla himself. Their presages promised him great prosperity, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
no threatenings of theirs subdued his evil passions. And then,
when he was in Asia conducting the war against Mithridates,
a message from Jupiter was delivered to him by Lucius Titius,
to the effect that he would conquer Mithridates; and so it came
to pass. And afterwards, when he was meditating a return
to Rome for the purpose of avenging in the blood of the
citizens injuries done to himself and his friends, a second
message from Jupiter was delivered to him by a soldier of
the sixth legion, to the effect that it was he who had predicted
the victory over Mithridates, and that now he promised to give
him power to recover the republic from his enemies, though
with great bloodshed. Sylla at once inquired of the soldier
what form had appeared to him; and, on his reply, recognised
that it was the same as Jupiter had formerly employed to
convey to him the assurance regarding the victory over Mithridates.
How, then, can the gods be justified in this matter
for the care they took to predict these shadowy successes, and
for their negligence in correcting Sylla, and restraining him
from stirring up a civil war so lamentable and atrocious, that it
not merely disfigured, but extinguished, the republic? The
truth is, as I have often said, and as Scripture informs us, and
as the facts themselves sufficiently indicate, the demons are
found to look after their own ends only, that they may be
regarded and worshipped as gods, and that men may be induced
to offer to them a worship which associates them with
their crimes, and involves them in one common wickedness
and judgment of God.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when Sylla had come to Tarentum, and had
sacrificed there, he saw on the head of the victim's liver the
likeness of a golden crown. Thereupon the same soothsayer
Postumius interpreted this to signify a signal victory, and
ordered that he only should eat of the entrails. A little
afterwards, the slave of a certain Lucius Pontius cried out, "I
am Bellona's messenger; the victory is yours, Sylla!" Then
he added that the Capitol should be burned. As soon as he
had uttered this prediction he left the camp, but returned the
following day more excited than ever, and shouted, "The Capitol
is fired!" And fired indeed it was. This it was easy for a
demon both to foresee and quickly to announce. But observe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
as relevant to our subject, what kind of gods they are under
whom these men desire to live, who blaspheme the Saviour
that delivers the wills of the faithful from the dominion of
devils. The man cried out in prophetic rapture, "The victory
is yours, Sylla!" And to certify that he spoke by a divine
spirit, he predicted also an event which was shortly to happen,
and which indeed did fall out, in a place from which he in
whom this spirit was speaking was far distant. But he never
cried, Forbear thy villanies, Sylla!&mdash;the villanies which were
committed at Rome by that victor to whom a golden crown
on the calf's liver had been shown as the divine evidence of
his victory. If such signs as this were customarily sent by
just gods, and not by wicked demons, then certainly the entrails
he consulted should rather have given Sylla intimation
of the cruel disasters that were to befall the city and himself.
For that victory was not so conducive to his exaltation to
power, as it was fatal to his ambition; for by it he became
so insatiable in his desires, and was rendered so arrogant and
reckless by prosperity, that he may be said rather to have
inflicted a moral destruction on himself than corporal destruction
on his enemies. But these truly woful and deplorable
calamities the gods gave him no previous hint of, neither
by entrails, augury, dream, nor prediction. For they feared
his amendment more than his defeat. Yea, they took good
care that this glorious conqueror of his own fellow-citizens
should be conquered and led captive by his own infamous
vices, and should thus be the more submissive slave of the
demons themselves.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>How powerfully the evil spirits incite men to wicked actions, by giving them
the quasi-divine authority of their example.</i></p>

<p>Now, who does not hereby comprehend,&mdash;unless he has
preferred to imitate such gods rather than by divine grace to
withdraw himself from their fellowship,&mdash;who does not see
how eagerly these evil spirits strive by their example to lend,
as it were, divine authority to crime? Is not this proved by
the fact that they were seen in a wide plain in Campania rehearsing
among themselves the battle which shortly after took
place there with great bloodshed between the armies of Rome?
For at first there were heard loud crashing noises, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
many reported that they had seen for some days together
two armies engaged. And when this battle ceased, they
found the ground all indented with just such footprints of
men and horses as a great conflict would leave. If, then, the
deities were veritably fighting with one another, the civil wars
of men are sufficiently justified; yet, by the way, let it be observed
that such pugnacious gods must be very wicked or very
wretched. If, however, it was but a sham-fight, what did
they intend by this, but that the civil wars of the Romans
should seem no wickedness, but an imitation of the gods?
For already the civil wars had begun; and before this, some
lamentable battles and execrable massacres had occurred.
Already many had been moved by the story of the soldier,
who, on stripping the spoils of his slain foe, recognised in the
stripped corpse his own brother, and, with deep curses on civil
wars, slew himself there and then on his brother's body. To
disguise the bitterness of such tragedies, and kindle increasing
ardour in this monstrous warfare, these malign demons, who
were reputed and worshipped as gods, fell upon this plan of
revealing themselves in a state of civil war, that no compunction
for fellow-citizens might cause the Romans to shrink
from such battles, but that the human criminality might be
justified by the divine example. By a like craft, too, did these
evil spirits command that scenic entertainments, of which I
have already spoken, should be instituted and dedicated to
them. And in these entertainments the poetical compositions
and actions of the drama ascribed such iniquities to the
gods, that every one might safely imitate them, whether he
believed the gods had actually done such things, or, not believing
this, yet perceived that they most eagerly desired to be
represented as having done them. And that no one might
suppose, that in representing the gods as fighting with one
another, the poets had slandered them, and imputed to them
unworthy actions, the gods themselves, to complete the deception,
confirmed the compositions of the poets by exhibiting
their own battles to the eyes of men, not only through actions
in the theatres, but in their own persons on the actual field.</p>

<p>We have been forced to bring forward these facts, because
their authors have not scrupled to say and to write that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Roman republic had already been ruined by the depraved
moral habits of the citizens, and had ceased to exist before the
advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now this ruin they do not
impute to their own gods, though they impute to our Christ
the evils of this life, which cannot ruin good men, be they
alive or dead. And this they do, though our Christ has
issued so many precepts inculcating virtue and restraining
vice; while their own gods have done nothing whatever to
preserve that republic that served them, and to restrain it
from ruin by such precepts, but have rather hastened its
destruction, by corrupting its morality through their pestilent
example. No one, I fancy, will now be bold enough to say
that the republic was then ruined because of the departure
of the gods "from each fane, each sacred shrine," as if they
were the friends of virtue, and were offended by the vices of
men. No, there are too many presages from entrails, auguries,
soothsayings, whereby they boastingly proclaimed themselves
prescient of future events and controllers of the fortune of
war,&mdash;all which prove them to have been present. And had
they been indeed absent, the Romans would never in these
civil wars have been so far transported by their own passions
as they were by the instigations of these gods.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That the demons gave in secret certain obscure instructions in morals, while
in public their own solemnities inculcated all wickedness.</i></p>

<p>Seeing that this is so,&mdash;seeing that the filthy and cruel
deeds, the disgraceful and criminal actions of the gods, whether
real or feigned, were at their own request published, and were
consecrated, and dedicated in their honour as sacred and
stated solemnities; seeing they vowed vengeance on those who
refused to exhibit them to the eyes of all, that they might be
proposed as deeds worthy of imitation, why is it that these
same demons, who, by taking pleasure in such obscenities, acknowledge
themselves to be unclean spirits, and by delighting
in their own villanies and iniquities, real or imaginary, and by
requesting from the immodest, and extorting from the modest,
the celebration of these licentious acts, proclaim themselves
instigators to a criminal and lewd life;&mdash;why, I ask, are they
represented as giving some good moral precepts to a few of
their own elect, initiated in the secrecy of their shrines? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
it be so, this very thing only serves further to demonstrate the
malicious craft of these pestilent spirits. For so great is the
influence of probity and chastity, that all men, or almost all
men, are moved by the praise of these virtues; nor is any
man so depraved by vice, but he hath some feeling of honour
left in him. So that, unless the devil sometimes transformed
himself, as Scripture says, into an angel of light,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> he could not
compass his deceitful purpose. Accordingly, in public, a bold
impurity fills the ear of the people with noisy clamour; in
private, a feigned chastity speaks in scarce audible whispers to
a few: an open stage is provided for shameful things, but on
the praiseworthy the curtain falls: grace hides, disgrace flaunts:
a wicked deed draws an overflowing house, a virtuous speech
finds scarce a hearer, as though purity were to be blushed at,
impurity boasted of. Where else can such confusion reign,
but in devils' temples? Where, but in the haunts of deceit?
For the secret precepts are given as a sop to the virtuous,
who are few in number; the wicked examples are exhibited
to encourage the vicious, who are countless.</p>

<p>Where and when those initiated in the mysteries of C&#339;lestis
received any good instructions, we know not. What we do
know is, that before her shrine, in which her image is set, and
amidst a vast crowd gathering from all quarters, and standing
closely packed together, we were intensely interested spectators
of the games which were going on, and saw, as we pleased to
turn the eye, on this side a grand display of harlots, on the
other the virgin goddess: we saw this virgin worshipped with
prayer and with obscene rites. There we saw no shamefaced
mimes, no actress overburdened with modesty: all that the
obscene rites demanded was fully complied with. We were
plainly shown what was pleasing to the virgin deity, and the
matron who witnessed the spectacle returned home from the
temple a wiser woman. Some, indeed, of the more prudent
women turned their faces from the immodest movements of
the players, and learned the art of wickedness by a furtive
regard. For they were restrained, by the modest demeanour
due to men, from looking boldly at the immodest gestures; but
much more were they restrained from condemning with chaste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
heart the sacred rites of her whom they adored. And yet
this licentiousness&mdash;which, if practised in one's home, could only
be done there in secret&mdash;was practised as a public lesson in the
temple; and if any modesty remained in men, it was occupied
in marvelling that wickedness which men could not unrestrainedly
commit should be part of the religious teaching of
the gods, and that to omit its exhibition should incur the
anger of the gods. What spirit can that be, which by a hidden
inspiration stirs men's corruption, and goads them to adultery,
and feeds on the full-fledged iniquity, unless it be the same that
finds pleasure in such religious ceremonies, sets in the temples
images of devils, and loves to see in play the images of vices;
that whispers in secret some righteous sayings to deceive the
few who are good, and scatters in public invitations to profligacy,
to gain possession of the millions who are wicked?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>That the obscenities of those plays which the Romans consecrated in order
to propitiate their gods, contributed largely to the overthrow of public
order.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Cicero, a weighty man, and a philosopher in his way, when
about to be made edile, wished the citizens to understand<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
that, among the other duties of his magistracy, he must propitiate
Flora by the celebration of games. And these games
are reckoned devout in proportion to their lewdness. In
another place,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and when he was now consul, and the state in
great peril, he says that games had been celebrated for ten
days together, and that nothing had been omitted which could
pacify the gods: as if it had not been more satisfactory to irritate
the gods by temperance, than to pacify them by debauchery;
and to provoke their hate by honest living, than soothe it by
such unseemly grossness. For no matter how cruel was the
ferocity of those men who were threatening the state, and on
whose account the gods were being propitiated: it could not
have been more hurtful than the alliance of gods who were
won with the foulest vices. To avert the danger which
threatened men's bodies, the gods were conciliated in a fashion
that drove virtue from their spirits; and the gods did not
enrol themselves as defenders of the battlements against the
besiegers, until they had first stormed and sacked the morality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the citizens. This propitiation of such divinities,&mdash;a propitiation
so wanton, so impure, so immodest, so wicked, so filthy,
whose actors the innate and praiseworthy virtue of the Romans
disabled from civic honours, erased from their tribe, recognised
as polluted and made infamous;&mdash;this propitiation, I say, so
foul, so detestable, and alien from every religious feeling, these
fabulous and ensnaring accounts of the criminal actions of the
gods, these scandalous actions which they either shamefully
and wickedly committed, or more shamefully and wickedly
feigned, all this the whole city learned in public both by the
words and gestures of the actors. They saw that the gods
delighted in the commission of these things, and therefore
believed that they wished them not only to be exhibited to
them, but to be imitated by themselves. But as for that good
and honest instruction which they speak of, it was given in
such secrecy, and to so few (if indeed given at all), that they
seemed rather to fear it might be divulged, than that it might
not be practised.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>That the Christian religion is health-giving.</i></p>

<p>They, then, are but abandoned and ungrateful wretches, in
deep and fast bondage to that malign spirit, who complain and
murmur that men are rescued by the name of Christ from the
hellish thraldom of these unclean spirits, and from a participation
in their punishment, and are brought out of the night of
pestilential ungodliness into the light of most healthful piety.
Only such men could murmur that the masses flock to the
churches and their chaste acts of worship, where a seemly
separation of the sexes is observed; where they learn how they
may so spend this earthly life, as to merit a blessed eternity
hereafter; where Holy Scripture and instruction in righteousness
are proclaimed from a raised platform in presence of all,
that both they who do the word may hear to their salvation,
and they who do it not may hear to judgment. And though
some enter who scoff at such precepts, all their petulance is
either quenched by a sudden change, or is restrained through
fear or shame. For no filthy and wicked action is there set
forth to be gazed at or to be imitated; but either the precepts
of the true God are recommended, His miracles narrated, His
gifts praised, or His benefits implored.</p>

<p class="center">29. <i>An exhortation to the Romans to renounce paganism.</i></p>

<p>This, rather, is the religion worthy of your desires, O admirable
Roman race,&mdash;the progeny of your Scævolas and Scipios, of
Regulus, and of Fabricius. This rather covet, this distinguish
from that foul vanity and crafty malice of the devils. If there
is in your nature any eminent virtue, only by true piety is it
purged and perfected, while by impiety it is wrecked and
punished. Choose now what you will pursue, that your praise
may be not in yourself, but in the true God, in whom is no
error. For of popular glory you have had your share; but by
the secret providence of God, the true religion was not offered
to your choice. Awake, it is now day; as you have already
awaked in the persons of some in whose perfect virtue and
sufferings for the true faith we glory: for they, contending
on all sides with hostile powers, and conquering them all by
bravely dying, have purchased for us this country of ours with
their blood; to which country we invite you, and exhort you
to add yourselves to the number of the citizens of this city,
which also has a sanctuary<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of its own in the true remission of
sins. Do not listen to those degenerate sons of thine who
slander Christ and Christians, and impute to them these disastrous
times, though they desire times in which they may
enjoy rather impunity for their wickedness than a peaceful life.
Such has never been Rome's ambition even in regard to her
earthly country. Lay hold now on the celestial country,
which is easily won, and in which you will reign truly and
for ever. For there shalt thou find no vestal fire, no Capitoline
stone, but the one true God</p>

<p>No longer, then, follow after false and deceitful gods; abjure
them rather, and despise them, bursting forth into true liberty.
Gods they are not, but malignant spirits, to whom your eternal
happiness will be a sore punishment. Juno, from whom you
deduce your origin according to the flesh, did not so bitterly
grudge Rome's citadels to the Trojans, as these devils whom
yet ye repute gods, grudge an everlasting seat to the race of
mankind. And thou thyself hast in no wavering voice passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
judgment on them, when thou didst pacify them with games,
and yet didst account as infamous the men by whom the plays
were acted. Suffer us, then, to assert thy freedom against the
unclean spirits who had imposed on thy neck the yoke of
celebrating their own shame and filthiness. The actors of
these divine crimes thou hast removed from offices of honour;
supplicate the true God, that He may remove from thee those
gods who delight in their crimes,&mdash;a most disgraceful thing if
the crimes are really theirs, and a most malicious invention
if the crimes are feigned. Well done, in that thou hast spontaneously
banished from the number of your citizens all actors
and players. Awake more fully: the majesty of God cannot be
propitiated by that which defiles the dignity of man. How,
then, can you believe that gods who take pleasure in such
lewd plays, belong to the number of the holy powers of heaven,
when the men by whom these plays are acted are by yourselves
refused admission into the number of Roman citizens
even of the lowest grade? Incomparably more glorious than
Rome, is that heavenly city in which for victory you have
truth; for dignity, holiness; for peace, felicity; for life, eternity.
Much less does it admit into its society such gods, if thou dost
blush to admit into thine such men. Wherefore, if thou wouldst
attain to the blessed city, shun the society of devils. They
who are propitiated by deeds of shame, are unworthy of the
worship of right-hearted men. Let these, then, be obliterated
from your worship by the cleansing of the Christian religion,
as those men were blotted from your citizenship by the censor's
mark.</p>

<p>But, so far as regards carnal benefits, which are the only
blessings the wicked desire to enjoy, and carnal miseries, which
alone they shrink from enduring, we will show in the following
book that the demons have not the power they are supposed
to have; and although they had it, we ought rather on that
account to despise these blessings, than for the sake of them
to worship those gods, and by worshipping them to miss the
attainment of these blessings they grudge us. But that they
have not even this power which is ascribed to them by those
who worship them for the sake of temporal advantages, this,
I say, I will prove in the following book; so let us here close
the present argument.</p>

<p>AS IN THE FOREGOING BOOK AUGUSTINE HAS PROVED REGARDING MORAL AND
SPIRITUAL CALAMITIES, SO IN THIS BOOK HE PROVES REGARDING EXTERNAL
AND BODILY DISASTERS, THAT SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE CITY THE
ROMANS HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY SUBJECT TO THEM; AND THAT EVEN
WHEN THE FALSE GODS WERE WORSHIPPED WITHOUT A RIVAL, BEFORE THE
ADVENT OF CHRIST, THEY AFFORDED NO RELIEF FROM SUCH CALAMITIES.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of the ills which alone the wicked fear, and which the world continually
suffered, even when the gods were worshipped.</i></p>

<p>Of moral and spiritual evils, which are above all others to
be deprecated, I think enough has already been said to
show that the false gods took no steps to prevent the people
who worshipped them from being overwhelmed by such calamities,
but rather aggravated the ruin. I see I must now
speak of those evils which alone are dreaded by the heathen&mdash;famine,
pestilence, war, pillage, captivity, massacre, and the
like calamities, already enumerated in the first book. For
evil men account those things alone evil which do not make
men evil; neither do they blush to praise good things, and
yet to remain evil among the good things they praise. It
grieves them more to own a bad house than a bad life, as if
it were man's greatest good to have everything good but himself.
But not even such evils as were alone dreaded by the
heathen were warded off by their gods, even when they were
most unrestrictedly worshipped. For in various times and
places before the advent of our Redeemer, the human race was
crushed with numberless and sometimes incredible calamities;
and at that time what gods but those did the world worship,
if you except the one nation of the Hebrews, and, beyond them,
such individuals as the most secret and most just judgment
of God counted worthy of divine grace?<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But that I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
not be prolix, I will be silent regarding the heavy calamities
that have been suffered by any other nations, and will speak
only of what happened to Rome and the Roman empire, by
which I mean Rome properly so called, and those lands which
already, before the coming of Christ, had by alliance or conquest
become, as it were, members of the body of the state.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Whether the gods, whom the Greeks and Romans worshipped in common,
were justified in permitting the destruction of Ilium.</i></p>

<p>First, then, why was Troy or Ilium, the cradle of the
Roman people (for I must not overlook nor disguise what I
touched upon in the first book<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>), conquered, taken, and destroyed
by the Greeks, though it esteemed and worshipped
the same gods as they? Priam, some answer, paid the
penalty of the perjury of his father Laomedon.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Then it is
true that Laomedon hired Apollo and Neptune as his workmen.
For the story goes that he promised them wages, and
then broke his bargain. I wonder that famous diviner Apollo
toiled at so huge a work, and never suspected Laomedon was
going to cheat him of his pay. And Neptune too, his uncle,
brother of Jupiter, king of the sea, it really was not seemly
that he should be ignorant of what was to happen. For he
is introduced by Homer<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> (who lived and wrote before the
building of Rome) as predicting something great of the posterity
of Æneas, who in fact founded Rome. And as Homer
says, Neptune also rescued Æneas in a cloud from the wrath of
Achilles, though (according to Virgil<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All his will was to destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His own creation, perjured Troy."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Gods, then, so great as Apollo and Neptune, in ignorance of
the cheat that was to defraud them of their wages, built the
walls of Troy for nothing but thanks and thankless people.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
There may be some doubt whether it is not a worse crime to
believe such persons to be gods, than to cheat such gods.
Even Homer himself did not give full credence to the story;
for while he represents Neptune, indeed, as hostile to the
Trojans, he introduces Apollo as their champion, though the
story implies that both were offended by that fraud. If, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
they believe their fables, let them blush to worship such
gods; if they discredit the fables, let no more be said of the
"Trojan perjury;" or let them explain how the gods hated
Trojan, but loved Roman perjury. For how did the conspiracy
of Catiline, even in so large and corrupt a city, find so abundant
a supply of men whose hands and tongues found them a
living by perjury and civic broils? What else but perjury
corrupted the judgments pronounced by so many of the senators?
What else corrupted the people's votes and decisions
of all causes tried before them? For it seems that the
ancient practice of taking oaths has been preserved even in
the midst of the greatest corruption, not for the sake of restraining
wickedness by religious fear, but to complete the tale
of crimes by adding that of perjury.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>That the gods could not be offended by the adultery of Paris, this crime being
so common among themselves.</i></p>

<p>There is no ground, then, for representing the gods (by
whom, as they say, that empire stood, though they are proved
to have been conquered by the Greeks) as being enraged at the
Trojan perjury. Neither, as others again plead in their defence,
was it indignation at the adultery of Paris that caused
them to withdraw their protection from Troy. For their
habit is to be instigators and instructors in vice, not its
avengers. "The city of Rome," says Sallust, "was first built
and inhabited, as I have heard, by the Trojans, who, flying
their country, under the conduct of Æneas, wandered about
without making any settlement."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> If, then, the gods were
of opinion that the adultery of Paris should be punished, it
was chiefly the Romans, or at least the Romans also, who
should have suffered; for the adultery was brought about by
Æneas' mother. But how could they hate in Paris a crime
which they made no objection to in their own sister Venus,
who (not to mention any other instance) committed adultery
with Anchises, and so became the mother of Æneas? Is it
because in the one case Menelaus<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> was aggrieved, while in
the other Vulcan<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> connived at the crime? For the gods, I
fancy, are so little jealous of their wives, that they make no
scruple of sharing them with men. But perhaps I may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
suspected of turning the myths into ridicule, and not handling
so weighty a subject with sufficient gravity. Well, then, let
us say that Æneas is not the son of Venus. I am willing to
I admit it; but is Romulus any more the son of Mars? For
why not the one as well as the other? Or is it lawful for
gods to have intercourse with women, unlawful for men to
have intercourse with goddesses? A hard, or rather an incredible
condition, that what was allowed to Mars by the law
of Venus, should not be allowed to Venus herself by her own
law. However, both cases have the authority of Rome; for
Cæsar in modern times believed no less that he was descended
from Venus,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> than the ancient Romulus believed himself the
son of Mars.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of Varro's opinion, that it is useful for men to feign themselves the offspring
of the gods.</i></p>

<p>Some one will say, But do you believe all this? Not I
indeed. For even Varro, a very learned heathen, all but
admits that these stories are false, though he does not boldly
and confidently say so. But he maintains it is useful for
states that brave men believe, though falsely, that they are
descended from the gods; for that thus the human spirit,
cherishing the belief of its divine descent, will both more
boldly venture into great enterprises, and will carry them out
more energetically, and will therefore by its very confidence
secure more abundant success. You see how wide a field is
opened to falsehood by this opinion of Varro's, which I have
expressed as well as I could in my own words; and how
comprehensible it is, that many of the religions and sacred
legends should be feigned in a community in which it was
judged profitable for the citizens that lies should be told even
about the gods themselves.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>5. <i>That it is not credible that the gods should have punished the adultery of
Paris, seeing they showed no indignation at the adultery of the mother of
Romulus.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But whether Venus could bear Æneas to a human father
Anchises, or Mars beget Romulus of the daughter of Numitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
we leave as unsettled questions. For our own Scriptures
suggest the very similar question, whether the fallen angels
had sexual intercourse with the daughters of men, by which
the earth was at that time filled with giants, that is, with enormously
large and strong men. At present, then, I will limit
my discussion to this dilemma: If that which their books
relate about the mother of Æneas and the father of Romulus
be true, how can the gods be displeased with men for adulteries
which, when committed by themselves, excite no displeasure?
If it is false, not even in this case can the gods be angry that
men should really commit adulteries, which, even when falsely
attributed to the gods, they delight in. Moreover, if the
adultery of Mars be discredited, that Venus also may be freed
from the imputation, then the mother of Romulus is left unshielded
by the pretext of a divine seduction. For Sylvia
was a vestal priestess, and the gods ought to avenge this sacrilege
on the Romans with greater severity than Paris' adultery
on the Trojans. For even the Romans themselves in primitive
times used to go so far as to bury alive any vestal who
was detected in adultery, while women unconsecrated, though
they were punished, were never punished with death for that
crime; and thus they more earnestly vindicated the purity of
shrines they esteemed divine, than of the human bed.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That the gods exacted no penalty for the fratricidal act of Romulus.</i></p>

<p>I add another instance: If the sins of men so greatly incensed
those divinities, that they abandoned Troy to fire and
sword to punish the crime of Paris, the murder of Romulus'
brother ought to have incensed them more against the Romans
than the cajoling of a Greek husband moved them against the
Trojans: fratricide in a newly-born city should have provoked
them more than adultery in a city already flourishing. It
makes no difference to the question we now discuss, whether
Romulus ordered his brother to be slain, or slew him with his
own hand; a crime this latter which many shamelessly deny,
many through shame doubt, many in grief disguise. And we
shall not pause to examine and weigh the testimonies of historical
writers on the subject. All agree that the brother of
Romulus was slain, not by enemies, not by strangers. If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
was Romulus who either commanded or perpetrated this crime;
Romulus was more truly the head of the Romans than Paris
of the Trojans; why then did he who carried off another man's
wife bring down the anger of the gods on the Trojans, while he
who took his brother's life obtained the guardianship of those
same gods? If, on the other hand, that crime was not wrought
either by the hand or will of Romulus, then the whole city is
chargeable with it, because it did not see to its punishment,
and thus committed, not fratricide, but parricide, which is worse.
For both brothers were the founders of that city, of which the
one was by villany prevented from being a ruler. So far as
I see, then, no evil can be ascribed to Troy which warranted
the gods in abandoning it to destruction, nor any good to Rome
which accounts for the gods visiting it with prosperity; unless
the truth be, that they fled from Troy because they were
vanquished, and betook themselves to Rome to practise their
characteristic deceptions there. Nevertheless they kept a
footing for themselves in Troy, that they might deceive future
inhabitants who repeopled these lands; while at Rome, by a
wider exercise of their malignant arts, they exulted in more
abundant honours.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the destruction of Ilium by Fimbria, a lieutenant of Marius.</i></p>

<p>And surely we may ask what wrong poor Ilium had done,
that, in the first heat of the civil wars of Rome, it should
suffer at the hand of Fimbria, the veriest villain among
Marius' partisans, a more fierce and cruel destruction than
the Grecian sack.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> For when the Greeks took it many
escaped, and many who did not escape were suffered to
live, though in captivity. But Fimbria from the first gave
orders that not a life should be spared, and burnt up together
the city and all its inhabitants. Thus was Ilium requited,
not by the Greeks, whom she had provoked by wrong-doing;
but by the Romans, who had been built out of her ruins;
while the gods, adored alike of both sides, did simply nothing,
or, to speak more correctly, could do nothing. Is it then true,
that at this time also, after Troy had repaired the damage
done by the Grecian fire, all the gods by whose help the kingdom
stood, "forsook each fane, each sacred shrine?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>But if so, I ask the reason; for in my judgment, the conduct
of the gods was as much to be reprobated as that of the
townsmen to be applauded. For these closed their gates
against Fimbria, that they might preserve the city for Sylla,
and were therefore burnt and consumed by the enraged
general. Now, up to this time, Sylla's cause was the more
worthy of the two; for till now he used arms to restore the
republic, and as yet his good intentions had met with no
reverses. What better thing, then, could the Trojans have
done? What more honourable, what more faithful to Rome, or
more worthy of her relationship, than to preserve their city for
the better part of the Romans, and to shut their gates against
a parricide of his country? It is for the defenders of the
gods to consider the ruin which this conduct brought on Troy.
The gods deserted an adulterous people, and abandoned Troy
to the fires of the Greeks, that out of her ashes a chaster
Rome might arise. But why did they a second time abandon
this same town, allied now to Rome, and not making
war upon her noble daughter, but preserving a most stedfast
and pious fidelity to Rome's most justifiable faction? Why did
they give her up to be destroyed, not by the Greek heroes,
but by the basest of the Romans? Or, if the gods did not
favour Sylla's cause, for which the unhappy Trojans maintained
their city, why did they themselves predict and promise
Sylla such successes? Must we call them flatterers of
the fortunate, rather than helpers of the wretched? Troy was
not destroyed, then, because the gods deserted it. For the
demons, always watchful to deceive, did what they could.
For, when all the statues were overthrown and burnt together
with the town, Livy tells us that only the image of Minerva
is said to have been found standing uninjured amidst the
ruins of her temple; not that it might be said in their praise,
"The gods who made this realm divine," but that it might not
be said in their defence, They are "gone from each fane, each
sacred shrine:" for that marvel was permitted to them, not
that they might be proved to be powerful, but that they might
be convicted of being present.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Whether Rome ought to have been entrusted to the Trojan gods?</i></p>

<p>Where, then, was the wisdom of entrusting Rome to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Trojan gods, who had demonstrated their weakness in the
loss of Troy? Will some one say that, when Fimbria
stormed Troy, the gods were already resident in Rome?
How, then, did the image of Minerva remain standing?
Besides, if they were at Rome when Fimbria destroyed Troy,
perhaps they were at Troy when Rome itself was taken and set
on fire by the Gauls. But as they are very acute in hearing,
and very swift in their movements, they came quickly at the
cackling of the goose to defend at least the Capitol, though to
defend the rest of the city they were too long in being warned.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether it is credible that the peace during the reign of Numa was brought
about by the gods.</i></p>

<p>It is also believed that it was by the help of the gods that
the successor of Romulus, Numa Pompilius, enjoyed peace
during his entire reign, and shut the gates of Janus, which
are customarily kept open<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> during war. And it is supposed
he was thus requited for appointing many religious observances
among the Romans. Certainly that king would have
commanded our congratulations for so rare a leisure, had he
been wise enough to spend it on wholesome pursuits, and,
subduing a pernicious curiosity, had sought out the true God
with true piety. But as it was, the gods were not the authors
of his leisure; but possibly they would have deceived him less
had they found him busier. For the more disengaged they
found him, the more they themselves occupied his attention.
Varro informs us of all his efforts, and of the arts he employed
to associate these gods with himself and the city; and in its
own place, if God will, I shall discuss these matters. Meanwhile,
as we are speaking of the benefits conferred by the
gods, I readily admit that peace is a great benefit; but it is
a benefit of the true God, which, like the sun, the rain, and
other supports of life, is frequently conferred on the ungrateful
and wicked. But if this great boon was conferred on
Rome and Pompilius by their gods, why did they never afterwards
grant it to the Roman empire during even more meritorious
periods? Were the sacred rites more efficient at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
their first institution than during their subsequent celebration?
But they had no existence in Numa's time, until he
added them to the ritual; whereas afterwards they had
already been celebrated and preserved, that benefit might
arise from them. How, then, is it that those forty-three, or
as others prefer it, thirty-nine years of Numa's reign, were
passed in unbroken peace, and yet that afterwards, when the
worship was established, and the gods themselves, who were
invoked by it, were the recognised guardians and patrons of
the city, we can with difficulty find during the whole period,
from the building of the city to the reign of Augustus, one
year&mdash;that, viz., which followed the close of the first Punic
war&mdash;in which, for a marvel, the Romans were able to shut
the gates of war?<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Do they reply that the Roman empire could never have
been so widely extended, nor so glorious, save by constant
and unintermitting wars? A fit argument, truly! Why
must a kingdom be distracted in order to be great? In this
little world of man's body, is it not better to have a moderate
stature, and health with it, than to attain the huge dimensions
of a giant by unnatural torments, and when you attain it to
find no rest, but to be pained the more in proportion to the
size of your members? What evil would have resulted, or
rather what good would not have resulted, had those times
continued which Sallust sketched, when he says, "At first the
kings (for that was the first title of empire in the world) were
divided in their sentiments: part cultivated the mind, others
the body: at that time the life of men was led without
covetousness; every one was sufficiently satisfied with his
own!"<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Was it requisite, then, for Rome's prosperity, that the
state of things which Virgil reprobates should succeed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At length stole on a baser age,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And war's indomitable rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And greedy lust of gain?"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>But obviously the Romans have a plausible defence for
undertaking and carrying on such disastrous wars,&mdash;to wit,
that the pressure of their enemies forced them to resist, so
that they were compelled to fight, not by any greed of human
applause, but by the necessity of protecting life and liberty.
Well, let that pass. Here is Sallust's account of the matter:
"For when their state, enriched with laws, institutions, territory,
seemed abundantly prosperous and sufficiently powerful,
according to the ordinary law of human nature, opulence gave
birth to envy. Accordingly, the neighbouring kings and states
took arms and assaulted them. A few allies lent assistance;
the rest, struck with fear, kept aloof from dangers. But the
Romans, watchful at home and in war, were active, made preparations,
encouraged one another, marched to meet their
enemies,&mdash;protected by arms their liberty, country, parents.
Afterwards, when they had repelled the dangers by their
bravery, they carried help to their allies and friends, and procured
alliances more by conferring than by receiving favours."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
This was to build up Rome's greatness by honourable means.
But, in Numa's reign, I would know whether the long peace
was maintained in spite of the incursions of wicked neighbours,
or if these incursions were discontinued that the peace
might be maintained? For if even then Rome was harassed
by wars, and yet did not meet force with force, the same
means she then used to quiet her enemies without conquering
them in war, or terrifying them with the onset of battle, she
might have used always, and have reigned in peace with the
gates of Janus shut. And if this was not in her power, then
Rome enjoyed peace not at the will of her gods, but at the
will of her neighbours round about, and only so long as they
cared to provoke her with no war, unless perhaps these pitiful
gods will dare to sell to one man as their favour what lies not
in their power to bestow, but in the will of another man.
These demons, indeed, in so far as they are permitted, can
terrify or incite the minds of wicked men by their own peculiar
wickedness. But if they always had this power, and if
no action were taken against their efforts by a more secret
and higher power, they would be supreme to give peace or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the victories of war, which almost always fall out through
some human emotion, and frequently in opposition to the will
of the gods, as is proved not only by lying legends, which
scarcely hint or signify any grain of truth, but even by
Roman history itself.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the statue of Apollo at Cumæ, whose tears are supposed to have portended
disaster to the Greeks, whom the god was unable to succour.</i></p>

<p>And it is still this weakness of the gods which is confessed
in the story of the Cuman Apollo, who is said to have wept
for four days during the war with the Achæans and King
Aristonicus. And when the augurs were alarmed at the
portent, and had determined to cast the statue into the sea,
the old men of Cumæ interposed, and related that a similar
prodigy had occurred to the same image during the wars
against Antiochus and against Perseus, and that by a decree
of the senate gifts had been presented to Apollo, because the
event had proved favourable to the Romans. Then soothsayers
were summoned who were supposed to have greater
professional skill, and they pronounced that the weeping of
Apollo's image was propitious to the Romans, because Cumæ
was a Greek colony, and that Apollo was bewailing (and
thereby presaging) the grief and calamity that was about to
light upon his own land of Greece, from which he had been
brought. Shortly afterwards it was reported that King Aristonicus
was defeated and made prisoner,&mdash;a defeat certainly
opposed to the will of Apollo; and this he indicated by even
shedding tears from his marble image. And this shows us
that, though the verses of the poets are mythical, they are not
altogether devoid of truth, but describe the manners of the
demons in a sufficiently fit style. For in Virgil Diana
mourned for Camilla,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and Hercules wept for Pallas doomed
to die.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> This is perhaps the reason why Numa Pompilius,
too, when, enjoying prolonged peace, but without knowing or
inquiring from whom he received it, he began in his leisure
to consider to what gods he should entrust the safe keeping
and conduct of Rome, and not dreaming that the true,
almighty, and most high God cares for earthly affairs, but
recollecting only that the Trojan gods which Æneas had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
brought to Italy had been able to preserve neither the Trojan
nor Lavinian kingdom founded by Æneas himself, concluded
that he must provide other gods as guardians of fugitives
and helpers of the weak, and add them to those earlier
divinities who had either come over to Rome with Romulus,
or when Alba was destroyed.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>That the Romans added a vast number of gods to those introduced by
Numa, and that their numbers helped them not at all.</i></p>

<p>But though Pompilius introduced so ample a ritual, yet did
not Rome see fit to be content with it. For as yet Jupiter
himself had not his chief temple,&mdash;it being King Tarquin
who built the Capitol. And Æsculapius left Epidaurus for
Rome, that in this foremost city he might have a finer field
for the exercise of his great medical skill.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The mother of
the gods, too, came I know not whence from Pessinuns; it
being unseemly that, while her son presided on the Capitoline
hill, she herself should lie hid in obscurity. But if she is the
mother of all the gods, she not only followed some of her
children to Rome, but left others to follow her. I wonder,
indeed, if she were the mother of Cynocephalus, who a long
while afterwards came from Egypt. Whether also the goddess
Fever was her offspring, is a matter for her grandson Æsculapius<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
to decide. But of whatever breed she be, the foreign
gods will not presume, I trust, to call a goddess base-born who
is a Roman citizen. Who can number the deities to whom
the guardianship of Rome was entrusted? Indigenous and
imported, both of heaven, earth, hell, seas, fountains, rivers;
and, as Varro says, gods certain and uncertain, male and
female: for, as among animals, so among all kinds of gods
are there these distinctions. Rome, then, enjoying the protection
of such a cloud of deities, might surely have been preserved
from some of those great and horrible calamities, of
which I can mention but a few. For by the great smoke of
her altars she summoned to her protection, as by a beacon-fire,
a host of gods, for whom she appointed and maintained
temples, altars, sacrifices, priests, and thus offended the true
and most high God, to whom alone all this ceremonial is lawfully
due. And, indeed, she was more prosperous when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
had fewer gods; but the greater she became, the more gods
she thought she should have, as the larger ship needs to be
manned by a larger crew. I suppose she despaired of the
smaller number, under whose protection she had spent comparatively
happy days, being able to defend her greatness.
For even under the kings (with the exception of Numa Pompilius,
of whom I have already spoken), how wicked a contentiousness
must have existed to occasion the death of
Romulus' brother!</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>By what right or agreement the Romans obtained their first wives.</i></p>

<p>How is it that neither Juno, who with her husband Jupiter
even then cherished</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>nor Venus herself, could assist the children of the loved
Æneas to find wives by some right and equitable means?
For the lack of this entailed upon the Romans the lamentable
necessity of stealing their wives, and then waging war with
their fathers-in-law; so that the wretched women, before they
had recovered from the wrong done them by their husbands,
were dowried with the blood of their fathers. "But the
Romans conquered their neighbours." Yes; but with what
wounds on both sides, and with what sad slaughter of relatives
and neighbours! The war of Cæsar and Pompey was the
contest of only one father-in-law with one son-in-law; and
before it began, the daughter of Cæsar, Pompey's wife, was
already dead. But with how keen and just an accent of grief
does Lucan<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> exclaim: "I sing that worse than civil war
waged in the plains of Emathia, and in which the crime was
justified by the victory!"</p>

<p>The Romans, then, conquered that they might, with hands
stained in the blood of their fathers-in-law, wrench the
miserable girls from their embrace,&mdash;girls who dared not
weep for their slain parents, for fear of offending their victorious
husbands; and while yet the battle was raging, stood
with their prayers on their lips, and knew not for whom to
utter them. Such nuptials were certainly prepared for the
Roman people not by Venus, but Bellona; or possibly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
infernal fury Alecto had more liberty to injure them now that
Juno was aiding them, than when the prayers of that goddess
had excited her against Æneas. Andromache in captivity
was happier than these Roman brides. For though she was a
slave, yet, after she had become the wife of Pyrrhus, no more
Trojans fell by his hand; but the Romans slew in battle the
very fathers of the brides they fondled. Andromache, the
victor's captive, could only mourn, not fear, the death of her
people. The Sabine women, related to men still combatants,
feared the death of their fathers when their husbands went
out to battle, and mourned their death as they returned, while
neither their grief nor their fear could be freely expressed.
For the victories of their husbands, involving the destruction
of fellow-townsmen, relatives, brothers, fathers, caused either
pious agony or cruel exultation. Moreover, as the fortune of
war is capricious, some of them lost their husbands by the
sword of their parents, while others lost husband and father
together in mutual destruction. For the Romans by no means
escaped with impunity, but they were driven back within
their walls, and defended themselves behind closed gates; and
when the gates were opened by guile, and the enemy admitted
into the town, the Forum itself was the field of a hateful and
fierce engagement of fathers-in-law and sons-in-law. The
ravishers were indeed quite defeated, and, flying on all sides
to their houses, sullied with new shame their original shameful
and lamentable triumph. It was at this juncture that
Romulus, hoping no more from the valour of his citizens,
prayed Jupiter that they might stand their ground; and from
this occasion the god gained the name of Stator. But not
even thus would the mischief have been finished, had not the
ravished women themselves flashed out with dishevelled hair,
and cast themselves before their parents, and thus disarmed
their just rage, not with the arms of victory, but with the
supplications of filial affection. Then Romulus, who could
not brook his own brother as a colleague, was compelled to
accept Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, as his partner on the
throne. But how long would he who misliked the fellowship
of his own twin-brother endure a stranger? So, Tatius being
slain, Romulus remained sole king, that he might be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
greater god. See what rights of marriage these were that
fomented unnatural wars. These were the Roman leagues of
kindred, relationship, alliance, religion. This was the life of
the city so abundantly protected by the gods. You see how
many severe things might be said on this theme; but our purpose
carries us past them, and requires our discourse for other
matters.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the wickedness of the war waged by the Romans against the Albans, and
of the victories won by the lust of power.</i></p>

<p>But what happened after Numa's reign, and under the other
kings, when the Albans were provoked into war, with sad results
not to themselves alone, but also to the Romans? The
long peace of Numa had become tedious; and with what
endless slaughter and detriment of both states did the Roman
and Alban armies bring it to an end! For Alba, which had
been founded by Ascanius, son of Æneas, and which was more
properly the mother of Rome than Troy herself, was provoked
to battle by Tullus Hostilius, king of Rome, and in the conflict
both inflicted and received such damage, that at length both
parties wearied of the struggle. It was then devised that the
war should be decided by the combat of three twin-brothers
from each army: from the Romans the three Horatii stood
forward, from the Albans the three Curiatii. Two of the
Horatii were overcome and disposed of by the Curiatii; but
by the remaining Horatius the three Curiatii were slain. Thus
Rome remained victorious, but with such a sacrifice that only
one survivor returned to his home. Whose was the loss on
both sides? Whose the grief, but of the offspring of Æneas, the
descendants of Ascanius, the progeny of Venus, the grandsons of
Jupiter? For this, too, was a "worse than civil" war, in which
the belligerent states were mother and daughter. And to this
combat of the three twin-brothers there was added another
atrocious and horrible catastrophe. For as the two nations
had formerly been friendly (being related and neighbours), the
sister of the Horatii had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii;
and she, when she saw her brother wearing the spoils of her
betrothed, burst into tears, and was slain by her own brother in
his anger. To me, this one girl seems to have been more humane
than the whole Roman people. I cannot think her to blame for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
lamenting the man to whom already she had plighted her troth,
or, as perhaps she was doing, for grieving that her brother should
have slain him to whom he had promised his sister. For why
do we praise the grief of Æneas (in Virgil<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>) over the enemy cut
down even by his own hand? Why did Marcellus shed tears
over the city of Syracuse, when he recollected, just before he
destroyed, its magnificence and meridian glory, and thought
upon the common lot of all things? I demand, in the name
of humanity, that if men are praised for tears shed over enemies
conquered by themselves, a weak girl should not be
counted criminal for bewailing her lover slaughtered by the
hand of her brother. While, then, that maiden was weeping
for the death of her betrothed inflicted by her brother's hand,
Rome was rejoicing that such devastation had been wrought
on her mother state, and that she had purchased a victory with
such an expenditure of the common blood of herself and the
Albans.</p>

<p>Why allege to me the mere names and words of "glory" and
"victory?" Tear off the disguise of wild delusion, and look at
the naked deeds: weigh them naked, judge them naked. Let
the charge be brought against Alba, as Troy was charged with
adultery. There is no such charge, none like it found: the
war was kindled only in order that there</p>

<span class="i0">"Might sound in languid ears the cry<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>This vice of restless ambition was the sole motive to that
social and parricidal war,&mdash;a vice which Sallust brands in
passing; for when he has spoken with brief but hearty commendation
of those primitive times in which life was spent
without covetousness, and every one was sufficiently satisfied
with what he had, he goes on: "But after Cyrus in Asia, and
the Lacedemonians and Athenians in Greece, began to subdue
cities and nations, and to account the lust of sovereignty a
sufficient ground for war, and to reckon that the greatest glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
consisted in the greatest empire;"<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and so on, as I need not now
quote. This lust of sovereignty disturbs and consumes the
human race with frightful ills. By this lust Rome was overcome
when she triumphed over Alba, and praising her own
crime, called it glory. For, as our Scriptures say, "the wicked
boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom
the Lord abhorreth."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Away, then, with these deceitful masks,
these deluding whitewashes, that things may be truthfully seen
and scrutinized. Let no man tell me that this and the other
was a "great" man, because he fought and conquered so and
so. Gladiators fight and conquer, and this barbarism has its
meed of praise; but I think it were better to take the consequences
of any sloth, than to seek the glory won by such
arms. And if two gladiators entered the arena to fight, one
being father, the other his son, who would endure such a spectacle?
who would not be revolted by it? How, then, could
that be a glorious war which a daughter-state waged against
its mother? Or did it constitute a difference, that the battlefield
was not an arena, and that the wide plains were filled
with the carcases not of two gladiators, but of many of the
flower of two nations; and that those contests were viewed not
by the amphitheatre, but by the whole world, and furnished a
profane spectacle both to those alive at the time, and to their
posterity, so long as the fame of it is handed down?</p>

<p>Yet those gods, guardians of the Roman empire, and, as it
were, theatric spectators of such contests as these, were not
satisfied until the sister of the Horatii was added by her
brother's sword as a third victim from the Roman side, so that
Rome herself, though she won the day, should have as many
deaths to mourn. Afterwards, as a fruit of the victory, Alba
was destroyed, though it was there the Trojan gods had formed
a third asylum after Ilium had been sacked by the Greeks, and
after they had left Lavinium, where Æneas had founded a
kingdom in a land of banishment. But probably Alba was
destroyed because from it too the gods had migrated, in their
usual fashion, as Virgil says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gone from each fane, each sacred shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are those who made this realm divine."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Gone, indeed, and from now their third asylum, that Rome
might seem all the wiser in committing herself to them after
they had deserted three other cities. Alba, whose king
Amulius had banished his brother, displeased them; Rome,
whose king Romulus had slain his brother, pleased them. But
before Alba was destroyed, its population, they say, was amalgamated
with the inhabitants of Rome, so that the two cities
were one. Well, admitting it was so, yet the fact remains
that the city of Ascanius, the third retreat of the Trojan gods,
was destroyed by the daughter-city. Besides, to effect this
pitiful conglomerate of the war's leavings, much blood was
spilt on both sides. And how shall I speak in detail of
the same wars, so often renewed in subsequent reigns, though
they seemed to have been finished by great victories; and of
wars that time after time were brought to an end by great
slaughters, and which yet time after time were renewed
by the posterity of those who had made peace and struck
treaties? Of this calamitous history we have no small proof,
in the fact that no subsequent king closed the gates of war;
and therefore, with all their tutelar gods, no one of them
reigned in peace.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>What manner of life and death the Roman kings had.</i></p>

<p>And what was the end of the kings themselves? Of
Romulus, a flattering legend tells us that he was assumed into
heaven. But certain Roman historians relate that he was
torn in pieces by the senate for his ferocity, and that a man,
Julius Proculus, was suborned to give out that Romulus had
appeared to him, and through him commanded the Roman
people to worship him as a god; and that in this way the
people, who were beginning to resent the action of the senate,
were quieted and pacified. For an eclipse of the sun had also
happened; and this was attributed to the divine power of
Romulus by the ignorant multitude, who did not know that
it was brought about by the fixed laws of the sun's course:
though this grief of the sun might rather have been considered
proof that Romulus had been slain, and that the crime
was indicated by this deprivation of the sun's light; as, in
truth, was the case when the Lord was crucified through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
cruelty and impiety of the Jews. For it is sufficiently demonstrated
that this latter obscuration of the sun did not occur
by the natural laws of the heavenly bodies, because it was
then the Jewish passover, which is held only at full moon,
whereas natural eclipses of the sun happen only at the last
quarter of the moon. Cicero, too, shows plainly enough that
the apotheosis of Romulus was imaginary rather than real, when,
even while he is praising him in one of Scipio's remarks in the
<i>De Republica</i>, he says: "Such a reputation had he acquired,
that when he suddenly disappeared during an eclipse of the
sun, he was supposed to have been assumed into the number
of the gods, which could be supposed of no mortal who had
not the highest reputation for virtue."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> By these words, "he
suddenly disappeared," we are to understand that he was mysteriously
made away with by the violence either of the tempest
or of a murderous assault. For their other writers speak not
only of an eclipse, but of a sudden storm also, which certainly
either afforded opportunity for the crime, or itself made an end
of Romulus. And of Tullus Hostilius, who was the third king
of Rome, and who was himself destroyed by lightning, Cicero
in the same book says, that "he was not supposed to have been
deified by this death, possibly because the Romans were unwilling
to vulgarize the promotion they were assured or persuaded
of in the case of Romulus, lest they should bring it
into contempt by gratuitously assigning it to all and sundry."
In one of his invectives,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> too, he says, in round terms, "The
founder of this city, Romulus, we have raised to immortality
and divinity by kindly celebrating his services;" implying
that his deification was not real, but reputed, and called so
by courtesy on account of his virtues. In the dialogue <i>Hortensius</i>,
too, while speaking of the regular eclipses of the sun,
he says that they "produce the same darkness as covered
the death of Romulus, which happened during an eclipse
of the sun." Here you see he does not at all shrink from
speaking of his "death," for Cicero was more of a reasoner
than an eulogist.</p>

<p>The other kings of Rome, too, with the exception of Numa
Pompilius and Ancus Marcius, who died natural deaths, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
horrible ends they had! Tullus Hostilius, the conqueror and
destroyer of Alba, was, as I said, himself and all his house
consumed by lightning. Priscus Tarquinius was slain by his
predecessor's sons. Servius Tullius was foully murdered by
his son-in-law Tarquinius Superbus, who succeeded him on the
throne. Nor did so flagrant a parricide committed against
Rome's best king drive from their altars and shrines those gods
who were said to have been moved by Paris' adultery to treat
poor Troy in this style, and abandon it to the fire and sword
of the Greeks. Nay, the very Tarquin who had murdered, was
allowed to succeed his father-in-law. And this infamous parricide,
during the reign he had secured by murder, was allowed
to triumph in many victorious wars, and to build the Capitol
from their spoils; the gods meanwhile not departing, but abiding,
and abetting, and suffering their king Jupiter to preside and
reign over them in that very splendid Capitol, the work of a
parricide. For he did not build the Capitol in the days of
his innocence, and then suffer banishment for subsequent
crimes; but to that reign during which he built the Capitol,
he won his way by unnatural crime. And when he was afterwards
banished by the Romans, and forbidden the city, it
was not for his own but his son's wickedness in the affair of
Lucretia,&mdash;a crime perpetrated not only without his cognizance,
but in his absence. For at that time he was besieging
Ardea, and fighting Rome's battles; and we cannot say what
he would have done had he been aware of his son's crime.
Notwithstanding, though his opinion was neither inquired into
nor ascertained, the people stripped him of royalty; and when
he returned to Rome with his army, it was admitted, but he
was excluded, abandoned by his troops, and the gates shut in
his face. And yet, after he had appealed to the neighbouring
states, and tormented the Romans with calamitous but unsuccessful
wars, and when he was deserted by the ally on
whom he most depended, despairing of regaining the kingdom,
he lived a retired and quiet life for fourteen years, as it
is reported, in Tusculum, a Roman town; where he grew old
in his wife's company, and at last terminated his days in a
much more desirable fashion than his father-in-law, who had
perished by the hand of his son-in-law; his own daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
abetting, if report be true. And this Tarquin the Romans
called, not the Cruel, nor the Infamous, but the Proud; their
own pride perhaps resenting his tyrannical airs. So little did
they make of his murdering their best king, his own father-in-law,
that they elected him their own king. I wonder if it
was not even more criminal in them to reward so bountifully
so great a criminal. And yet there was no word of the gods
abandoning the altars; unless, perhaps, some one will say in
defence of the gods, that they remained at Rome for the purpose
of punishing the Romans, rather than of aiding and profiting
them, seducing them by empty victories, and wearing them
out by severe wars. Such was the life of the Romans under
the kings during the much-praised epoch of the state which
extends to the expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus in the 243d
year, during which all those victories, which were bought with
so much blood and such disasters, hardly pushed Rome's
dominion twenty miles from the city; a territory which would
by no means bear comparison with that of any petty Gætulian
state.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>16. <i>Of the first Roman consuls, the one of whom drove the other from the country,
and shortly after perished at Rome by the hand of a wounded enemy,
and so ended a career of unnatural murders.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To this epoch let us add also that of which Sallust says,
that it was ordered with justice and moderation, while the
fear of Tarquin and of a war with Etruria was impending. For
so long as the Etrurians aided the efforts of Tarquin to regain
the throne, Rome was convulsed with distressing war. And
therefore he says that the state was ordered with justice and
moderation, through the pressure of fear, not through the influence
of equity. And in this very brief period, how calamitous
a year was that in which consuls were first created, when
the kingly power was abolished! They did not fulfil their
term of office. For Junius Brutus deprived his colleague
Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, and banished him from the
city; and shortly after he himself fell in battle, at once
slaying and slain, having formerly put to death his own sons
and his brothers-in-law, because he had discovered that they
were conspiring to restore Tarquin. It is this deed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Virgil shudders to record, even while he seems to praise it;
for when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And call his own rebellious seed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For menaced liberty to bleed,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>he immediately exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unhappy father! howsoe'er<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The deed be judged by after days;"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that is to say, let posterity judge the deed as they please,
let them praise and extol the father who slew his sons, he is
unhappy. And then he adds, as if to console so unhappy a
man:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His country's love shall all o'erbear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And unextinguished thirst of praise."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the tragic end of Brutus, who slew his own sons, and
though he slew his enemy, Tarquin's son, yet could not survive
him, but was survived by Tarquin the elder, does not
the innocence of his colleague Collatinus seem to be vindicated,
who, though a good citizen, suffered the same punishment
as Tarquin himself, when that tyrant was banished?
For Brutus himself is said to have been a relative<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> of Tarquin.
But Collatinus had the misfortune to bear not only
the blood, but the name of Tarquin. To change his name,
then, not his country, would have been his fit penalty: to
abridge his name by this word, and be called simply L. Collatinus.
But he was not compelled to lose what he could
lose without detriment, but was stripped of the honour of the
first consulship, and was banished from the land he loved. Is
this, then, the glory of Brutus&mdash;this injustice, alike detestable
and profitless to the republic? Was it to this he was driven
by "his country's love, and unextinguished thirst of praise?"</p>

<p>When Tarquin the tyrant was expelled, L. Tarquinius Collatinus,
the husband of Lucretia, was created consul along
with Brutus. How justly the people acted, in looking more
to the character than the name of a citizen! How unjustly
Brutus acted, in depriving of honour and country his colleague
in that new office, whom he might have deprived of his name,
if it were so offensive to him! Such were the ills, such the
disasters, which fell out when the government was "ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
with justice and moderation." Lucretius, too, who succeeded
Brutus, was carried off by disease before the end of that same
year. So P. Valerius, who succeeded Collatinus, and M. Horatius,
who filled the vacancy occasioned by the death of Lucretius,
completed that disastrous and funereal year, which had
five consuls. Such was the year in which the Roman republic
inaugurated the new honour and office of the consulship.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the disasters which vexed the Roman republic after the inauguration of
the consulship, and of the non-intervention of the gods of Rome.</i></p>

<p>After this, when their fears were gradually diminished,&mdash;not
because the wars ceased, but because they were not so
furious,&mdash;that period in which things were "ordered with
justice and moderation" drew to an end, and there followed
that state of matters which Sallust thus briefly sketches:
"Then began the patricians to oppress the people as slaves,
to condemn them to death or scourging, as the kings had
done, to drive them from their holdings, and to tyrannize over
those who had no property to lose. The people, overwhelmed
by these oppressive measures, and most of all by usury, and
obliged to contribute both money and personal service to the
constant wars, at length took arms and seceded to Mount
Aventine and Mount Sacer, and thus secured for themselves
tribunes and protective laws. But it was only the second
Punic war that put an end on both sides to discord and
strife."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But why should I spend time in writing such
things, or make others spend it in reading them? Let the
terse summary of Sallust suffice to intimate the misery of the
republic through all that long period till the second Punic
war,&mdash;how it was distracted from without by unceasing wars,
and torn with civil broils and dissensions. So that those
victories they boast were not the substantial joys of the
happy, but the empty comforts of wretched men, and seductive
incitements to turbulent men to concoct disasters upon
disasters. And let not the good and prudent Romans be
angry at our saying this; and indeed we need neither deprecate
nor denounce their anger, for we know they will harbour
none. For we speak no more severely than their own authors,
and much less elaborately and strikingly; yet they diligently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
read these authors, and compel their children to learn them.
But they who are angry, what would they do to me were I
to say what Sallust says? "Frequent mobs, seditions, and at
last civil wars, became common, while a few leading men on
whom the masses were dependent, affected supreme power
under the seemly pretence of seeking the good of senate and
people; citizens were judged good or bad, without reference
to their loyalty to the republic (for all were equally corrupt);
but the wealthy and dangerously powerful were esteemed good
citizens, because they maintained the existing state of things."
Now, if those historians judged that an honourable freedom of
speech required that they should not be silent regarding the
blemishes of their own state, which they have in many places
loudly applauded in their ignorance of that other and true city
in which citizenship is an everlasting dignity; what does it
become us to do, whose liberty ought to be so much greater,
as our hope in God is better and more assured, when they
impute to our Christ the calamities of this age, in order that
men of the less instructed and weaker sort may be alienated
from that city in which alone eternal and blessed life can
be enjoyed? Nor do we utter against their gods anything
more horrible than their own authors do, whom they read and
circulate. For, indeed, all that we have said we have derived
from them, and there is much more to say of a worse kind
which we are unable to say.</p>

<p>Where, then, were those gods who are supposed to be justly
worshipped for the slender and delusive prosperity of this
world, when the Romans, who were seduced to their service
by lying wiles, were harassed by such calamities? Where
were they when Valerius the consul was killed while defending
the Capitol, that had been fired by exiles and slaves? He
was himself better able to defend the temple of Jupiter, than
that crowd of divinities with their most high and mighty king,
whose temple he came to the rescue of, were able to defend
him. Where were they when the city, worn out with unceasing
seditions, was waiting in some kind of calm for the return
of the ambassadors who had been sent to Athens to borrow
laws, and was desolated by dreadful famine and pestilence?
Where were they when the people, again distressed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
famine, created for the first time a prefect of the market; and
when Spurius Melius, who, as the famine increased, distributed
corn to the famishing masses, was accused of aspiring to royalty,
and at the instance of this same prefect, and on the authority
of the superannuated dictator L. Quintius, was put to death by
Quintus Servilius, master of the horse,&mdash;an event which occasioned
a serious and dangerous riot? Where were they when
that very severe pestilence visited Rome, on account of which
the people, after long and wearisome and useless supplications
of the helpless gods, conceived the idea of celebrating Lectisternia,
which had never been done before; that is to say,
they set couches in honour of the gods, which accounts for
the name of this sacred rite, or rather sacrilege?<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Where
were they when, during ten successive years of reverses, the
Roman army suffered frequent and great losses among the
Veians, and would have been destroyed but for the succour
of Furius Camillus, who was afterwards banished by an ungrateful
country? Where were they when the Gauls took,
sacked, burned, and desolated Rome? Where were they when
that memorable pestilence wrought such destruction, in which
Furius Camillus too perished, who first defended the ungrateful
republic from the Veians, and afterwards saved it from the
Gauls? Nay, during this plague they introduced a new pestilence
of scenic entertainments, which spread its more fatal
contagion, not to the bodies, but the morals of the Romans?
Where were they when another frightful pestilence visited the
city&mdash;I mean the poisonings imputed to an incredible number
of noble Roman matrons, whose characters were infected with
a disease more fatal than any plague? Or when both consuls
at the head of the army were beset by the Samnites in
the Caudine Forks, and forced to strike a shameful treaty,
600 Roman knights being kept as hostages; while the troops,
having laid down their arms, and being stripped of everything,
were made to pass under the yoke with one garment each?
Or when, in the midst of a serious pestilence, lightning struck
the Roman camp and killed many? Or when Rome was
driven, by the violence of another intolerable plague, to send
to Epidaurus for Æsculapius as a god of medicine; since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
frequent adulteries of Jupiter in his youth had not perhaps
left this king of all who so long reigned in the Capitol, any
leisure for the study of medicine? Or when, at one time,
the Lucanians, Brutians, Samnites, Tuscans, and Senonian
Gauls conspired against Rome, and first slew her ambassadors,
then overthrew an army under the prætor, putting to the sword
13,000 men, besides the commander and seven tribunes? Or
when the people, after the serious and long-continued disturbances
at Rome, at last plundered the city and withdrew
to Janiculus; a danger so grave, that Hortensius was created
dictator,&mdash;an office which they had recourse to only in extreme
emergencies; and he, having brought back the people, died
while yet he retained his office,&mdash;an event without precedent
in the case of any dictator, and which was a shame to those
gods who had now Æsculapius among them?</p>

<p>At that time, indeed, so many wars were everywhere engaged
in, that through scarcity of soldiers they enrolled for
military service the <i>proletarii</i>, who received this name, because,
being too poor to equip for military service, they had
leisure to beget offspring.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Pyrrhus, king of Greece, and at
that time of wide-spread renown, was invited by the Tarentines
to enlist himself against Rome. It was to him that Apollo,
when consulted regarding the issue of his enterprise, uttered
with some pleasantry so ambiguous an oracle, that whichever
alternative happened, the god himself should be counted
divine. For he so worded the oracle,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> that whether Pyrrhus
was conquered by the Romans, or the Romans by Pyrrhus,
the soothsaying god would securely await the issue. And
then what frightful massacres of both armies ensued! Yet
Pyrrhus remained conqueror, and would have been able now
to proclaim Apollo a true diviner, as he understood the oracle,
had not the Romans been the conquerors in the next engagement.
And while such disastrous wars were being waged, a
terrible disease broke out among the women. For the pregnant
women died before delivery. And Æsculapius, I fancy, excused
himself in this matter on the ground that he professed to be
arch-physician, not midwife. Cattle, too, similarly perished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
so that it was believed that the whole race of animals was
destined to become extinct. Then what shall I say of that
memorable winter in which the weather was so incredibly
severe, that in the Forum frightfully deep snow lay for forty
days together, and the Tiber was frozen? Had such things
happened in our time, what accusations we should have heard
from our enemies! And that other great pestilence, which
raged so long and carried off so many; what shall I say of
it? Spite of all the drugs of Æsculapius, it only grew worse
in its second year, till at last recourse was had to the Sibylline
books,&mdash;a kind of oracle which, as Cicero says in his <i>De
Divinatione</i>, owes significance to its interpreters, who make
doubtful conjectures as they can or as they wish. In this
instance, the cause of the plague was said to be that so many
temples had been used as private residences. And thus
Æsculapius for the present escaped the charge of either ignominious
negligence or want of skill. But why were so many
allowed to occupy sacred tenements without interference, unless
because supplication had long been addressed in vain to
such a crowd of gods, and so by degrees the sacred places were
deserted of worshippers, and being thus vacant, could without
offence be put at least to some human uses? And the temples,
which were at that time laboriously recognised and restored
that the plague might be stayed, fell afterwards into disuse,
and were again devoted to the same human uses. Had they
not thus lapsed into obscurity, it could not have been pointed
to as proof of Varro's great erudition, that in his work on
sacred places he cites so many that were unknown. Meanwhile,
the restoration of the temples procured no cure of the
plague, but only a fine excuse for the gods.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>The disasters suffered by the Romans in the Punic wars, which were not
mitigated by the protection of the gods.</i></p>

<p>In the Punic wars, again, when victory hung so long in
the balance between the two kingdoms, when two powerful
nations were straining every nerve and using all their resources
against one another, how many smaller kingdoms
were crushed, how many large and flourishing cities were demolished,
how many states were overwhelmed and ruined, how
many districts and lands far and near were desolated! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
often were the victors on either side vanquished! What
multitudes of men, both of those actually in arms and
of others, were destroyed! What huge navies, too, were
crippled in engagements, or were sunk by every kind of
marine disaster! Were we to attempt to recount or mention
these calamities, we should become writers of history. At
that period Rome was mightily perturbed, and resorted to
vain and ludicrous expedients. On the authority of the
Sibylline books, the secular games were re-appointed, which
had been inaugurated a century before, but had faded into
oblivion in happier times. The games consecrated to the infernal
gods were also renewed by the pontiffs; for they, too,
had sunk into disuse in the better times. And no wonder;
for when they were renewed, the great abundance of dying
men made all hell rejoice at its riches, and give itself up to
sport: for certainly the ferocious wars, and disastrous quarrels,
and bloody victories&mdash;now on one side, and now on the other&mdash;though
most calamitous to men, afforded great sport and
a rich banquet to the devils. But in the first Punic war
there was no more disastrous event than the Roman defeat in
which Regulus was taken. We made mention of him in the
two former books as an incontestably great man, who had
before conquered and subdued the Carthaginians, and who
would have put an end to the first Punic war, had not an
inordinate appetite for praise and glory prompted him to impose
on the worn-out Carthaginians harder conditions than
they could bear. If the unlooked-for captivity and unseemly
bondage of this man, his fidelity to his oath, and his surpassingly
cruel death, do not bring a blush to the face of the gods,
it is true that they are brazen and bloodless.</p>

<p>Nor were there wanting at that time very heavy disasters
within the city itself. For the Tiber was extraordinarily
flooded, and destroyed almost all the lower parts of the city;
some buildings being carried away by the violence of the
torrent, while others were soaked to rottenness by the water
that stood round them even after the flood was gone. This
visitation was followed by a fire which was still more destructive,
for it consumed some of the loftier buildings round
the Forum, and spared not even its own proper temple, that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Vesta, in which virgins chosen for this honour, or rather for
this punishment, had been employed in conferring, as it were,
everlasting life on fire, by ceaselessly feeding it with fresh
fuel. But at the time we speak of, the fire in the temple was
not content with being kept alive: it raged. And when the
virgins, scared by its vehemence, were unable to save those
fatal images which had already brought destruction on three
cities<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> in which they had been received, Metellus the priest,
forgetful of his own safety, rushed in and rescued the sacred
things, though he was half roasted in doing so. For either
the fire did not recognise even him, or else the goddess of fire
was there,&mdash;a goddess who would not have fled from the fire
supposing she had been there. But here you see how a man
could be of greater service to Vesta than she could be to him.
Now if these gods could not avert the fire from themselves,
what help against flames or flood could they bring to the state
of which they were the reputed guardians? Facts have shown
that they were useless. These objections of ours would be
idle if our adversaries maintained that their idols are consecrated
rather as symbols of things eternal, than to secure the
blessings of time; and that thus, though the symbols, like all
material and visible things, might perish, no damage thereby
resulted to the things for the sake of which they had been
consecrated, while, as for the images themselves, they could be
renewed again for the same purposes they had formerly served.
But with lamentable blindness, they suppose that, through the
intervention of perishable gods, the earthly well-being and temporal
prosperity of the state can be preserved from perishing.
And so, when they are reminded that even when the gods remained
among them this well-being and prosperity were blighted,
they blush to change the opinion they are unable to defend.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the calamity of the second Punic war, which consumed the strength
of both parties.</i></p>

<p>As to the second Punic war, it were tedious to recount the
disasters it brought on both the nations engaged in so protracted
and shifting a war, that (by the acknowledgment even
of those writers who have made it their object not so much to
narrate the wars as to eulogize the dominion of Rome) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
people who remained victorious were less like conquerors than
conquered. For, when Hannibal poured out of Spain over the
Pyrenees, and overran Gaul, and burst through the Alps, and
during his whole course gathered strength by plundering and
subduing as he went, and inundated Italy like a torrent, how
bloody were the wars, and how continuous the engagements,
that were fought! How often were the Romans vanquished!
How many towns went over to the enemy, and how many
were taken and subdued! What fearful battles there were,
and how often did the defeat of the Romans shed lustre on the
arms of Hannibal! And what shall I say of the wonderfully
crushing defeat at Cannæ, where even Hannibal, cruel as he
was, was yet sated with the blood of his bitterest enemies, and
gave orders that they be spared? From this field of battle he
sent to Carthage three bushels of gold rings, signifying that so
much of the rank of Rome had that day fallen, that it was
easier to give an idea of it by measure than by numbers; and
that the frightful slaughter of the common rank and file whose
bodies lay undistinguished by the ring, and who were numerous
in proportion to their meanness, was rather to be conjectured
than accurately reported. In fact, such was the scarcity
of soldiers after this, that the Romans impressed their criminals
on the promise of impunity, and their slaves by the bribe of
liberty, and out of these infamous classes did not so much
recruit as create an army. But these slaves, or, to give them
all their titles, these freedmen who were enlisted to do battle
for the republic of Rome, lacked arms. And so they took
arms from the temples, as if the Romans were saying to their
gods: Lay down those arms you have held so long in vain, if
by chance our slaves may be able to use to purpose what you,
our gods, have been impotent to use. At that time, too, the
public treasury was too low to pay the soldiers, and private
resources were used for public purposes; and so generously
did individuals contribute of their property, that, saving the
gold ring and bulla which each wore, the pitiful mark of his
rank, no senator, and much less any of the other orders and
tribes, reserved any gold for his own use. But if in our day
they were reduced to this poverty, who would be able to
endure their reproaches, barely endurable as they are now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
when more money is spent on actors for the sake of a superfluous
gratification, than was then disbursed to the legions?</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the destruction of the Saguntines, who received no help from the Roman
gods, though perishing on account of their fidelity to Rome.</i></p>

<p>But among all the disasters of the second Punic war, there
occurred none more lamentable, or calculated to excite deeper
complaint, than the fate of the Saguntines. This city of Spain,
eminently friendly to Rome, was destroyed by its fidelity to
the Roman people. For when Hannibal had broken treaty with
the Romans, he sought occasion for provoking them to war,
and accordingly made a fierce assault upon Saguntum. When
this was reported at Rome, ambassadors were sent to Hannibal,
urging him to raise the siege; and when this remonstrance was
neglected, they proceeded to Carthage, lodged complaint against
the breaking of the treaty, and returned to Rome without accomplishing
their object. Meanwhile the siege went on; and
in the eighth or ninth month, this opulent but ill-fated city,
dear as it was to its own state and to Rome, was taken, and
subjected to treatment which one cannot read, much less narrate,
without horror. And yet, because it bears directly on
the matter in hand, I will briefly touch upon it. First, then,
famine wasted the Saguntines, so that even human corpses
were eaten by some: so at least it is recorded. Subsequently,
when thoroughly worn out, that they might at least escape the
ignominy of falling into the hands of Hannibal, they publicly
erected a huge funeral pile, and cast themselves into its flames,
while at the same time they slew their children and themselves
with the sword. Could these gods, these debauchees and
gourmands, whose mouths water for fat sacrifices, and whose
lips utter lying divinations,&mdash;could they not do anything in a
case like this? Could they not interfere for the preservation of
a city closely allied to the Roman people, or prevent it perishing
for its fidelity to that alliance of which they themselves
had been the mediators? Saguntum, faithfully keeping the
treaty it had entered into before these gods, and to which it
had firmly bound itself by an oath, was besieged, taken, and
destroyed by a perjured person. If afterwards, when Hannibal
was close to the walls of Rome, it was the gods who terrified
him with lightning and tempest, and drove him to a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
why, I ask, did they not thus interfere before? For I make
bold to say, that this demonstration with the tempest would
have been more honourably made in defence of the allies of
Rome&mdash;who were in danger on account of their reluctance to
break faith with the Romans, and had no resources of their
own&mdash;than in defence of the Romans themselves, who were
fighting in their own cause, and had abundant resources to
oppose Hannibal. If, then, they had been the guardians of
Roman prosperity and glory, they would have preserved that
glory from the stain of this Saguntine disaster; and how silly
it is to believe that Rome was preserved from destruction at
the hands of Hannibal by the guardian care of those gods who
were unable to rescue the city of Saguntum from perishing
through its fidelity to the alliance of Rome. If the population
of Saguntum had been Christian, and had suffered as it
did for the Christian faith (though, of course, Christians would
not have used fire and sword against their own persons), they
would have suffered with that hope which springs from faith
in Christ&mdash;the hope not of a brief temporal reward, but of unending
and eternal bliss. What, then, will the advocates and
apologists of these gods say in their defence, when charged
with the blood of these Saguntines; for they are professedly
worshipped and invoked for this very purpose of securing prosperity
in this fleeting and transitory life? Can anything be
said but what was alleged in the case of Regulus' death? For
though there is a difference between the two cases, the one
being an individual, the other a whole community, yet the
cause of destruction was in both cases the keeping of their
plighted troth. For it was this which made Regulus willing
to return to his enemies, and this which made the Saguntines
unwilling to revolt to their enemies. Does, then, the keeping
of faith provoke the gods to anger? Or is it possible that not
only individuals, but even entire communities, perish while
the gods are propitious to them? Let our adversaries choose
which alternative they will. If, on the one hand, those gods
are enraged at the keeping of faith, let them enlist perjured
persons as their worshippers. If, on the other hand, men and
states can suffer great and terrible calamities, and at last perish
while favoured by the gods, then does their worship not produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
happiness as its fruit. Let those, therefore, who suppose
that they have fallen into distress because their religious worship
has been abolished, lay aside their anger; for it were quite
possible that did the gods not only remain with them, but regard
them with favour, they might yet be left to mourn an
unhappy lot, or might, even like Regulus and the Saguntines,
be horribly tormented, and at last perish miserably.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the ingratitude of Rome to Scipio, its deliverer, and of its manners
during the period which Sallust describes as the best.</i></p>

<p>Omitting many things, that I may not exceed the limits
of the work I have proposed to myself, I come to the epoch
between the second and last Punic wars, during which, according
to Sallust, the Romans lived with the greatest virtue and
concord. Now, in this period of virtue and harmony, the
great Scipio, the liberator of Rome and Italy, who had with
surprising ability brought to a close the second Punic war&mdash;that
horrible, destructive, dangerous contest&mdash;who had defeated
Hannibal and subdued Carthage, and whose whole life is said
to have been dedicated to the gods, and cherished in their
temples,&mdash;this Scipio, after such a triumph, was obliged to
yield to the accusations of his enemies, and to leave his
country, which his valour had saved and liberated, to spend
the remainder of his days in the town of Liternum, so
indifferent to a recall from exile, that he is said to have
given orders that not even his remains should lie in his
ungrateful country. It was at that time also that the proconsul
Cn. Manlius, after subduing the Galatians, introduced
into Rome the luxury of Asia, more destructive than all
hostile armies. It was then that iron bedsteads and expensive
carpets were first used; then, too, that female singers
were admitted at banquets, and other licentious abominations
were introduced. But at present I meant to speak, not of the
evils men voluntarily practise, but of those they suffer in spite
of themselves. So that the case of Scipio, who succumbed to
his enemies, and died in exile from the country he had rescued,
was mentioned by me as being pertinent to the present discussion;
for this was the reward he received from those
Roman gods whose temples he saved from Hannibal, and
who are worshipped only for the sake of securing temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
happiness. But since Sallust, as we have seen, declares that
the manners of Rome were never better than at that time, I
therefore judged it right to mention the Asiatic luxury then
introduced, that it might be seen that what he says is true, only
when that period is compared with the others, during which
the morals were certainly worse, and the factions more violent.
For at that time&mdash;I mean between the second and third Punic
war&mdash;that notorious Lex Voconia was passed, which prohibited
a man from making a woman, even an only daughter, his heir;
than which law I am at a loss to conceive what could be
more unjust. It is true that in the interval between these
two Punic wars the misery of Rome was somewhat less.
Abroad, indeed, their forces were consumed by wars, yet also
consoled by victories; while at home there were not such
disturbances as at other times. But when the last Punic war
had terminated in the utter destruction of Rome's rival, which
quickly succumbed to the other Scipio, who thus earned for
himself the surname of Africanus, then the Roman republic was
overwhelmed with such a host of ills, which sprang from the
corrupt manners induced by prosperity and security, that the
sudden overthrow of Carthage is seen to have injured Rome
more seriously than her long-continued hostility. During the
whole subsequent period down to the time of Cæsar Augustus,
who seems to have entirely deprived the Romans of liberty,&mdash;a
liberty, indeed, which in their own judgment was no longer
glorious, but full of broils and dangers, and which now was
quite enervated and languishing,&mdash;and who submitted all things
again to the will of a monarch, and infused as it were a new
life into the sickly old age of the republic, and inaugurated a
fresh <i>régime</i>;&mdash;during this whole period, I say, many military
disasters were sustained on a variety of occasions, all of which
I here pass by. There was specially the treaty of Numantia,
blotted as it was with extreme disgrace; for the sacred
chickens, they say, flew out of the coop, and thus augured
disaster to Mancinus the consul; just as if, during all these
years in which that little city of Numantia had withstood the
besieging army of Rome, and had become a terror to the
republic, the other generals had all marched against it under
unfavourable auspices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Of the edict of Mithridates, commanding that all Roman citizens found in
Asia should be slain.</i></p>

<p>These things, I say, I pass in silence; but I can by no
means be silent regarding the order given by Mithridates,
king of Asia, that on one day all Roman citizens residing
anywhere in Asia (where great numbers of them were following
their private business) should be put to death: and this
order was executed. How miserable a spectacle was then
presented, when each man was suddenly and treacherously
murdered wherever he happened to be, in the field or on the
road, in the town, in his own home, or in the street, in market
or temple, in bed or at table! Think of the groans of the
dying, the tears of the spectators, and even of the executioners
themselves. For how cruel a necessity was it that compelled
the hosts of these victims, not only to see these abominable
butcheries in their own houses, but even to perpetrate them:
to change their countenance suddenly from the bland kindliness
of friendship, and in the midst of peace set about the
business of war; and, shall I say, give and receive wounds,
the slain being pierced in body, the slayer in spirit! Had
all these murdered persons, then, despised auguries? Had
they neither public nor household gods to consult when they
left their homes and set out on that fatal journey? If they
had not, our adversaries have no reason to complain of these
Christian times in this particular, since long ago the Romans
despised auguries as idle. If, on the other hand, they did
consult omens, let them tell us what good they got thereby,
even when such things were not prohibited, but authorized,
by human, if not by divine law.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the internal disasters which vexed the Roman republic, and followed a
portentous madness which seized all the domestic animals.</i></p>

<p>But let us now mention, as succinctly as possible, those
disasters which were still more vexing, because nearer home;
I mean those discords which are erroneously called civil, since
they destroy civil interests. The seditions had now become
urban wars, in which blood was freely shed, and in which parties
raged against one another, not with wrangling and verbal
contention, but with physical force and arms. What a sea of
Roman blood was shed, what desolations and devastations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
occasioned in Italy by wars social, wars servile, wars civil!
Before the Latins began the social war against Rome, all the
animals used in the service of man&mdash;dogs, horses, asses, oxen,
and all the rest that are subject to man&mdash;suddenly grew wild,
and forgot their domesticated tameness, forsook their stalls
and wandered at large, and could not be closely approached
either by strangers or their own masters without danger. If
this was a portent, how serious a calamity must have been
portended by a plague which, whether portent or no, was in
itself a serious calamity! Had it happened in our day, the
heathen would have been more rabid against us than their
animals were against them.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the civil dissension occasioned by the sedition of the Gracchi.</i></p>

<p>The civil wars originated in the seditions which the
Gracchi excited regarding the agrarian laws; for they were
minded to divide among the people the lands which were
wrongfully possessed by the nobility. But to reform an
abuse of so long standing was an enterprise full of peril, or
rather, as the event proved, of destruction. For what disasters
accompanied the death of the elder Gracchus! what slaughter
ensued when, shortly after, the younger brother met the same
fate! For noble and ignoble were indiscriminately massacred;
and this not by legal authority and procedure, but by mobs
and armed rioters. After the death of the younger Gracchus,
the consul Lucius Opimius, who had given battle to him
within the city, and had defeated and put to the sword both
himself and his confederates, and had massacred many of the
citizens, instituted a judicial examination of others, and is
reported to have put to death as many as 3000 men. From
this it may be gathered how many fell in the riotous encounters,
when the result even of a judicial investigation was
so bloody. The assassin of Gracchus himself sold his head
to the consul for its weight in gold, such being the previous
agreement. In this massacre, too, Marcus Fulvius, a man of
consular rank, with all his children, was put to death.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of the temple of Concord, which was erected by a decree of the senate on the
scene of these seditions and massacres.</i></p>

<p>A pretty decree of the senate it was, truly, by which the
temple of Concord was built on the spot where that disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
rising had taken place, and where so many citizens of every
rank had fallen.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> I suppose it was that the monument of the
Gracchi's punishment might strike the eye and affect the
memory of the pleaders. But what was this but to deride
the gods, by building a temple to that goddess who, had she
been in the city, would not have suffered herself to be torn
by such dissensions? Or was it that Concord was chargeable
with that bloodshed because she had deserted the minds of
the citizens, and was therefore incarcerated in that temple?
For if they had any regard to consistency, why did they not
rather erect on that site a temple of Discord? Or is there
a reason for Concord being a goddess while Discord is none?
Does the distinction of Labeo hold here, who would have
made the one a good, the other an evil deity?&mdash;a distinction
which seems to have been suggested to him by the mere fact
of his observing at Rome a temple to Fever as well as one to
Health. But, on the same ground, Discord as well as Concord
ought to be deified. A hazardous venture the Romans made
in provoking so wicked a goddess, and in forgetting that the
destruction of Troy had been occasioned by her taking offence.
For, being indignant that she was not invited with the other
gods [to the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis], she created dissension
among the three goddesses by sending in the golden
apple, which occasioned strife in heaven, victory to Venus,
the rape of Helen, and the destruction of Troy. Wherefore,
if she was perhaps offended that the Romans had not thought
her worthy of a temple among the other gods in their city,
and therefore disturbed the state with such tumults, to how
much fiercer passion would she be roused when she saw the
temple of her adversary erected on the scene of that massacre,
or, in other words, on the scene of her own handiwork! Those
wise and learned men are enraged at our laughing at these
follies; and yet, being worshippers of good and bad divinities
alike, they cannot escape this dilemma about Concord and
Discord: either they have neglected the worship of these
goddesses, and preferred Fever and War, to whom there are
shrines erected of great antiquity, or they have worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
them, and after all Concord has abandoned them, and Discord
has tempestuously hurled them into civil wars.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Of the various kinds of wars which followed the building of the temple of
Concord.</i></p>

<p>But they supposed that, in erecting the temple of Concord
within the view of the orators, as a memorial of the punishment
and death of the Gracchi, they were raising an effectual
obstacle to sedition. How much effect it had, is indicated by
the still more deplorable wars that followed. For after this
the orators endeavoured not to avoid the example of the
Gracchi, but to surpass their projects; as did Lucius Saturninus,
a tribune of the people, and Caius Servilius the prætor,
and some time after Marcus Drusus, all of whom stirred seditions
which first of all occasioned bloodshed, and then the
social wars by which Italy was grievously injured, and reduced
to a piteously desolate and wasted condition. Then followed the
servile war and the civil wars; and in them what battles were
fought, and what blood was shed, so that almost all the peoples
of Italy, which formed the main strength of the Roman empire,
were conquered as if they were barbarians! Then even historians
themselves find it difficult to explain how the servile war
was begun by a very few, certainly less than seventy gladiators,
what numbers of fierce and cruel men attached themselves to
these, how many of the Roman generals this band defeated,
and how it laid waste many districts and cities. And that
was not the only servile war: the province of Macedonia, and
subsequently Sicily and the sea-coast, were also depopulated
by bands of slaves. And who can adequately describe either
the horrible atrocities which the pirates first committed, or the
wars they afterwards maintained against Rome?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the civil war between Marius and Sylla.</i></p>

<p>But when Marius, stained with the blood of his fellow-citizens,
whom the rage of party had sacrificed, was in his turn
vanquished and driven from the city, it had scarcely time to
breathe freely, when, to use the words of Cicero, "Cinna and
Marius together returned and took possession of it. Then,
indeed, the foremost men in the state were put to death, its
lights quenched. Sylla afterwards avenged this cruel victory;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
but we need not say with what loss of life, and with what ruin
to the republic."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> For of this vengeance, which was more
destructive than if the crimes which it punished had been
committed with impunity, Lucan says: "The cure was excessive,
and too closely resembled the disease. The guilty
perished, but when none but the guilty survived: and then
private hatred and anger, unbridled by law, were allowed free
indulgence."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> In that war between Marius and Sylla, besides
those who fell in the field of battle, the city, too, was filled
with corpses in its streets, squares, markets, theatres, and
temples; so that it is not easy to reckon whether the victors
slew more before or after victory, that they might be, or because
they were, victors. As soon as Marius triumphed, and
returned from exile, besides the butcheries everywhere perpetrated,
the head of the consul Octavius was exposed on the
rostrum; Cæsar and Fimbria were assassinated in their own
houses; the two Crassi, father and son, were murdered in one
another's sight; Bebius and Numitorius were disembowelled by
being dragged with hooks; Catulus escaped the hands of his
enemies by drinking poison; Merula, the flamen of Jupiter,
cut his veins and made a libation of his own blood to his god.
Moreover, every one whose salutation Marius did not answer
by giving his hand, was at once cut down before his face.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>Of the victory of Sylla, the avenger of the cruelties of Marius.</i></p>

<p>Then followed the victory of Sylla, the so-called avenger of
the cruelties of Marius. But not only was his victory purchased
with great bloodshed; but when hostilities were finished,
hostility survived, and the subsequent peace was bloody as the
war. To the former and still recent massacres of the elder
Marius, the younger Marius and Carbo, who belonged to the
same party, added greater atrocities. For when Sylla approached,
and they despaired not only of victory, but of life
itself, they made a promiscuous massacre of friends and foes.
And, not satisfied with staining every corner of Rome with
blood, they besieged the senate, and led forth the senators to
death from the curia as from a prison. Mucius Scævola the
pontiff was slain at the altar of Vesta, which he had clung to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
because no spot in Rome was more sacred than her temple;
and his blood well-nigh extinguished the fire which was kept
alive by the constant care of the virgins. Then Sylla entered
the city victorious, after having slaughtered in the Villa Publica,
not by combat, but by an order, 7000 men who had surrendered,
and were therefore unarmed; so fierce was the rage
of peace itself, even after the rage of war was extinct. Moreover,
throughout the whole city every partisan of Sylla slew
whom he pleased, so that the number of deaths went beyond
computation, till it was suggested to Sylla that he should allow
some to survive, that the victors might not be destitute of
subjects. Then this furious and promiscuous licence to murder
was checked, and much relief was expressed at the publication
of the prescription list, containing though it did the death-warrant
of two thousand men of the highest ranks, the senatorial
and equestrian. The large number was indeed saddening,
but it was consolatory that a limit was fixed; nor was the
grief at the numbers slain so great as the joy that the rest
were secure. But this very security, hard-hearted as it was,
could not but bemoan the exquisite torture applied to some of
those who had been doomed to die. For one was torn to
pieces by the unarmed hands of the executioners; men treating
a living man more savagely than wild beasts are used to
tear an abandoned corpse. Another had his eyes dug out, and
his limbs cut away bit by bit, and was forced to live a long
while, or rather to die a long while, in such torture. Some
celebrated cities were put up to auction, like farms; and one
was collectively condemned to slaughter, just as an individual
criminal would be condemned to death. These things were
done in peace when the war was over, not that victory might
be more speedily obtained, but that, after being obtained, it
might not be thought lightly of. Peace vied with war in
cruelty, and surpassed it: for while war overthrew armed
hosts, peace slew the defenceless. War gave liberty to him
who was attacked, to strike if he could; peace granted to the
survivors not life, but an unresisting death.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>29. <i>A comparison of the disasters which Rome experienced during the Gothic
and Gallic invasions, with those occasioned by the authors of the civil wars.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What fury of foreign nations, what barbarian ferocity, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
compare with this victory of citizens over citizens? Which
was more disastrous, more hideous, more bitter to Rome: the
recent Gothic and the old Gallic invasion, or the cruelty displayed
by Marius and Sylla and their partisans against men
who were members of the same body as themselves? The
Gauls, indeed, massacred all the senators they found in any part
of the city except the Capitol, which alone was defended; but
they at least sold life to those who were in the Capitol, though
they might have starved them out if they could not have
stormed it. The Goths, again, spared so many senators, that
it is the more surprising that they killed any. But Sylla,
while Marius was still living, established himself as conqueror
in the Capitol, which the Gauls had not violated, and thence
issued his death-warrants; and when Marius had escaped by
flight, though destined to return more fierce and bloodthirsty
than ever, Sylla issued from the Capitol even decrees of the
senate for the slaughter and confiscation of the property of
many citizens. Then, when Sylla left, what did the Marian
faction hold sacred or spare, when they gave no quarter even
to Mucius, a citizen, a senator, a pontiff, and though clasping
in piteous embrace the very altar in which, they say, reside
the destinies of Rome? And that final proscription list of
Sylla's, not to mention countless other massacres, despatched
more senators than the Goths could even plunder.</p>


<p class="center">30. <i>Of the connection of the wars which with great severity and frequency
followed one another before the advent of Christ.</i></p>

<p>With what effrontery, then, with what assurance, with what
impudence, with what folly, or rather insanity, do they refuse
to impute these disasters to their own gods, and impute the
present to our Christ! These bloody civil wars, more distressing,
by the avowal of their own historians, than any foreign wars,
and which were pronounced to be not merely calamitous, but
absolutely ruinous to the republic, began long before the coming
of Christ, and gave birth to one another; so that a concatenation
of unjustifiable causes led from the wars of Marius and
Sylla to those of Sertorius and Catiline, of whom the one was
proscribed, the other brought up by Sylla; from this to the
war of Lepidus and Catulus, of whom the one wished to rescind,
the other to defend the acts of Sylla; from this to the war of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Pompey and Cæsar, of whom Pompey had been a partisan of
Sylla, whose power he equalled or even surpassed, while Cæsar
condemned Pompey's power because it was not his own, and
yet exceeded it when Pompey was defeated and slain. From
him the chain of civil wars extended to the second Cæsar,
afterwards called Augustus, and in whose reign Christ was
born. For even Augustus himself waged many civil wars;
and in these wars many of the foremost men perished, among
them that skilful manipulator of the republic, Cicero. Caius
[Julius] Cæsar, when he had conquered Pompey, though he
used his victory with clemency, and granted to men of the opposite
faction both life and honours, was suspected of aiming
at royalty, and was assassinated in the curia by a party of
noble senators, who had conspired to defend the liberty of the
republic. His power was then coveted by Antony, a man of
very different character, polluted and debased by every kind of
vice, who was strenuously resisted by Cicero on the same plea
of defending the liberty of the republic. At this juncture that
other Cæsar, the adopted son of Caius, and afterwards, as I
said, known by the name of Augustus, had made his <i>début</i> as
a young man of remarkable genius. This youthful Cæsar was
favoured by Cicero, in order that his influence might counteract
that of Antony; for he hoped that Cæsar would overthrow and
blast the power of Antony, and establish a free state,&mdash;so blind
and unaware of the future was he: for that very young man,
whose advancement and influence he was fostering, allowed
Cicero to be killed as the seal of an alliance with Antony, and
subjected to his own rule the very liberty of the republic in
defence of which he had made so many orations.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>31. <i>That it is effrontery to impute the present troubles to Christ and the prohibition
of polytheistic worship, since even when the gods were worshipped
such calamities befell the people.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Let those who have no gratitude to Christ for His great
benefits, blame their own gods for these heavy disasters. For
certainly when these occurred the altars of the gods were kept
blazing, and there rose the mingled fragrance of "Sabæan
incense and fresh garlands;"<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the priests were clothed with
honour, the shrines were maintained in splendour; sacrifices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
games, sacred ecstasies, were common in the temples; while the
blood of the citizens was being so freely shed, not only in
remote places, but among the very altars of the gods. Cicero
did not choose to seek sanctuary in a temple, because Mucius
had sought it there in vain. But they who most unpardonably
calumniate this Christian era, are the very men who
either themselves fled for asylum to the places specially dedicated
to Christ, or were led there by the barbarians that they
might be safe. In short, not to recapitulate the many
instances I have cited, and not to add to their number others
which it were tedious to enumerate, this one thing I am persuaded
of, and this every impartial judgment will readily
acknowledge, that if the human race had received Christianity
before the Punic wars, and if the same desolating calamities
which these wars brought upon Europe and Africa had followed
the introduction of Christianity, there is no one of those
who now accuse us who would not have attributed them to
our religion. How intolerable would their accusations have
been, at least so far as the Romans are concerned, if the
Christian religion had been received and diffused prior to the
invasion of the Gauls, or to the ruinous floods and fires which
desolated Rome, or to those most calamitous of all events, the
civil wars! And those other disasters, which were of so strange
a nature that they were reckoned prodigies, had they happened
since the Christian era, to whom but to the Christians would
they have imputed these as crimes? I do not speak of those
things which were rather surprising than hurtful,&mdash;oxen speaking,
unborn infants articulating some words in their mothers'
wombs, serpents flying, hens and women being changed into
the other sex; and other similar prodigies which, whether true
or false, are recorded not in their imaginative, but in their historical
works, and which do not injure, but only astonish men.
But when it rained earth, when it rained chalk, when it rained
stones&mdash;not hailstones, but real stones&mdash;this certainly was
calculated to do serious damage. We have read in their books
that the fires of Etna, pouring down from the top of the mountain
to the neighbouring shore, caused the sea to boil, so that
rocks were burnt up, and the pitch of ships began to run,&mdash;a
phenomenon incredibly surprising, but at the same time no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
less hurtful. By the same violent heat, they relate that on
another occasion Sicily was filled with cinders, so that the
houses of the city Catina were destroyed and buried under
them,&mdash;a calamity which moved the Romans to pity them, and
remit their tribute for that year. One may also read that
Africa, which had by that time become a province of Rome,
was visited by a prodigious multitude of locusts, which, after
consuming the fruit and foliage of the trees, were driven into
the sea in one vast and measureless cloud; so that when they
were drowned and cast upon the shore the air was polluted,
and so serious a pestilence produced that in the kingdom of
Masinissa alone they say there perished 800,000 persons,
besides a much greater number in the neighbouring districts.
At Utica they assure us that, of 30,000 soldiers then garrisoning
it, there survived only ten. Yet which of these disasters,
suppose they happened now, would not be attributed to the
Christian religion by those who thus thoughtlessly accuse us,
and whom we are compelled to answer? And yet to their
own gods they attribute none of these things, though they
worship them for the sake of escaping lesser calamities of the
same kind, and do not reflect that they who formerly worshipped
them were not preserved from these serious disasters.</p>

HEATHEN, TO WHOM INDIVIDUALLY SCARCE EVEN SINGLE THINGS AND
THE VERY BASEST FUNCTIONS WERE BELIEVED TO BE ENTRUSTED, BUT TO
THE ONE TRUE GOD, THE AUTHOR OF FELICITY, BY WHOSE POWER AND
JUDGMENT EARTHLY KINGDOMS ARE FOUNDED AND MAINTAINED.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of the things which have been discussed in the first book.</i></p>

<p>Having begun to speak of the city of God, I have
thought it necessary first of all to reply to its enemies,
who, eagerly pursuing earthly joys, and gaping after transitory
things, throw the blame of all the sorrow they suffer in them&mdash;rather
through the compassion of God in admonishing,
than His severity in punishing&mdash;on the Christian religion,
which is the one salutary and true religion. And since there
is among them also an unlearned rabble, they are stirred up
as by the authority of the learned to hate us more bitterly,
thinking in their inexperience that things which have happened
unwontedly in their days were not wont to happen in
other times gone by; and whereas this opinion of theirs is confirmed
even by those who know that it is false, and yet dissemble
their knowledge in order that they may seem to have
just cause for murmuring against us, it was necessary, from
books in which their authors recorded and published the history
of bygone times that it might be known, to demonstrate
that it is far otherwise than they think; and at the same
time to teach that the false gods, whom they openly worshipped,
or still worship in secret, are most unclean spirits,
and most malignant and deceitful demons, even to such a
pitch that they take delight in crimes which, whether real or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
only fictitious, are yet their own, which it has been their will
to have celebrated in honour of them at their own festivals;
so that human infirmity cannot be called back from the perpetration
of damnable deeds, so long as authority is furnished
for imitating them that seems even divine. These things we
have proved, not from our own conjectures, but partly from
recent memory, because we ourselves have seen such things
celebrated, and to such deities, partly from the writings of
those who have left these things on record to posterity, not as
if in reproach, but as in honour of their own gods. Thus
Varro, a most learned man among them, and of the weightiest
authority, when he made separate books concerning things
human and things divine, distributing some among the human,
others among the divine, according to the special dignity of
each, placed the scenic plays not at all among things human,
but among things divine; though, certainly, if only there
were good and honest men in the state, the scenic plays ought
not to be allowed even among things human. And this he
did not on his own authority, but because, being born and
educated at Rome, he found them among the divine things.
Now as we briefly stated in the end of the first book what
we intended afterwards to discuss, and as we have disposed
of a part of this in the next two books, we see what our
readers will expect us now to take up.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of those things which are contained in Books Second and Third.</i></p>

<p>We had promised, then, that we would say something
against those who attribute the calamities of the Roman republic
to our religion, and that we would recount the evils,
as many and great as we could remember or might deem
sufficient, which that city, or the provinces belonging to its
empire, had suffered before their sacrifices were prohibited,
all of which would beyond doubt have been attributed to us,
if our religion had either already shone on them, or had thus
prohibited their sacrilegious rites. These things we have, as
we think, fully disposed of in the second and third books,
treating in the second of evils in morals, which alone or
chiefly are to be accounted evils; and in the third, of those
which only fools dread to undergo&mdash;namely, those of the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
or of outward things&mdash;which for the most part the good also
suffer. But those evils by which they themselves become
evil, they take, I do not say patiently, but with pleasure. And
how few evils have I related concerning that one city and its
empire! Not even all down to the time of Cæsar Augustus.
What if I had chosen to recount and enlarge on those evils,
not which men have inflicted on each other, such as the devastations
and destructions of war, but which happen in earthly
things, from the elements of the world itself? Of such evils
Apuleius speaks briefly in one passage of that book which he
wrote, <i>De Mundo</i>, saying that all earthly things are subject to
change, overthrow, and destruction.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> For, to use his own
words, by excessive earthquakes the ground has burst asunder,
and cities with their inhabitants have been clean destroyed:
by sudden rains whole regions have been washed away; those
also which formerly had been continents, have been insulated
by strange and new-come waves, and others, by the subsiding
of the sea, have been made passable by the foot of man: by
winds and storms cities have been overthrown; fires have
flashed forth from the clouds, by which regions in the East
being burnt up have perished; and on the western coasts the
like destructions have been caused by the bursting forth of
waters and floods. So, formerly, from the lofty craters of Etna,
rivers of fire kindled by God have flowed like a torrent down
the steeps. If I had wished to collect from history wherever
I could, these and similar instances, where should I have
finished what happened even in those times before the name
of Christ had put down those of their idols, so vain and hurtful
to true salvation? I promised that I should also point
out which of their customs, and for what cause, the true God,
in whose power all kingdoms are, had deigned to favour to
the enlargement of their empire; and how those whom they
think gods can have profited them nothing, but much rather
hurt them by deceiving and beguiling them; so that it seems
to me I must now speak of these things, and chiefly of the
increase of the Roman empire. For I have already said not
a little, especially in the second book, about the many evils
introduced into their manners by the hurtful deceits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
demons whom they worshipped as gods. But throughout all
the three books already completed, where it appeared suitable,
we have set forth how much succour God, through the name
of Christ, to whom the barbarians beyond the custom of war
paid so much honour, has bestowed on the good and bad,
according as it is written, "Who maketh His sun to rise on
the good and the evil, and giveth rain to the just and the
unjust."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>3. <i>Whether the great extent of the empire, which has been acquired only by wars,
is to be reckoned among the good things either of the wise or the happy.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, therefore, let us see how it is that they dare
to ascribe the very great extent and duration of the Roman
empire to those gods whom they contend that they worship
honourably, even by the obsequies of vile games and the
ministry of vile men: although I should like first to inquire
for a little what reason, what prudence, there is in wishing
to glory in the greatness and extent of the empire, when
you cannot point out the happiness of men who are always
rolling, with dark fear and cruel lust, in warlike slaughters
and in blood, which, whether shed in civil or foreign war, is
still human blood; so that their joy may be compared to glass
in its fragile splendour, of which one is horribly afraid lest it
should be suddenly broken in pieces. That this may be more
easily discerned, let us not come to nought by being carried
away with empty boasting, or blunt the edge of our attention
by loud-sounding names of things, when we hear of peoples,
kingdoms, provinces. But let us suppose a case of two men;
for each individual man, like one letter in a language, is as it
were the element of a city or kingdom, however far-spreading
in its occupation of the earth. Of these two men let us suppose
that one is poor, or rather of middling circumstances; the
other very rich. But the rich man is anxious with fears,
pining with discontent, burning with covetousness, never
secure, always uneasy, panting from the perpetual strife of
his enemies, adding to his patrimony indeed by these miseries
to an immense degree, and by these additions also heaping
up most bitter cares. But that other man of moderate wealth
is contented with a small and compact estate, most dear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
his own family, enjoying the sweetest peace with his kindred
neighbours and friends, in piety religious, benignant in mind,
healthy in body, in life frugal, in manners chaste, in conscience
secure. I know not whether any one can be such a fool, that
he dare hesitate which to prefer. As, therefore, in the case of
these two men, so in two families, in two nations, in two kingdoms,
this test of tranquillity holds good; and if we apply
it vigilantly and without prejudice, we shall quite easily see
where the mere show of happiness dwells, and where real
felicity. Wherefore if the true God is worshipped, and if He
is served with genuine rites and true virtue, it is advantageous
that good men should long reign both far and wide. Nor is
this advantageous so much to themselves, as to those over
whom they reign. For, so far as concerns themselves, their
piety and probity, which are great gifts of God, suffice to give
them true felicity, enabling them to live well the life that
now is, and afterwards to receive that which is eternal. In
this world, therefore, the dominion of good men is profitable, not
so much for themselves as for human affairs. But the dominion
of bad men is hurtful chiefly to themselves who rule, for
they destroy their own souls by greater licence in wickedness;
while those who are put under them in service are not hurt
except by their own iniquity. For to the just all the evils
imposed on them by unjust rulers are not the punishment
of crime, but the test of virtue. Therefore the good man,
although he is a slave, is free; but the bad man, even if he
reigns, is a slave, and that not of one man, but, what is far
more grievous, of as many masters as he has vices; of which
vices when the divine Scripture treats, it says, "For of whom
any man is overcome, to the same he is also the bond-slave."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>


<p class="center">4. <i>How like kingdoms without justice are to robberies.</i></p>

<p>Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but
great robberies? For what are robberies themselves, but little
kingdoms? The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled
by the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact
of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on.
If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
to such a degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession
of cities, and subdues peoples, it assumes the more
plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now
manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness,
but by the addition of impunity. Indeed, that was an apt
and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a
pirate who had been seized. For when that king had asked
the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the
sea, he answered with bold pride, "What thou meanest by
seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty
ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a
great fleet art styled emperor."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the runaway gladiators whose power became like that of royal dignity.</i></p>

<p>I shall not therefore stay to inquire what sort of men
Romulus gathered together, seeing he deliberated much about
them,&mdash;how, being assumed out of that life they led into the
fellowship of his city, they might cease to think of the punishment
they deserved, the fear of which had driven them to
greater villanies; so that henceforth they might be made more
peaceable members of society. But this I say, that the Roman
empire, which by subduing many nations had already grown
great and an object of universal dread, was itself greatly
alarmed, and only with much difficulty avoided a disastrous
overthrow, because a mere handful of gladiators in Campania,
escaping from the games, had recruited a great army, appointed
three generals, and most widely and cruelly devastated Italy.
Let them say what god aided these men, so that from a small
and contemptible band of robbers they attained to a kingdom,
feared even by the Romans, who had such great forces and
fortresses. Or will they deny that they were divinely aided
because they did not last long?<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> As if, indeed, the life of
any man whatever lasted long. In that case, too, the gods
aid no one to reign, since all individuals quickly die; nor is
sovereign power to be reckoned a benefit, because in a little
time in every man, and thus in all of them one by one, it
vanishes like a vapour. For what does it matter to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
who worshipped the gods under Romulus, and are long since
dead, that after their death the Roman empire has grown so
great, while they plead their causes before the powers beneath?
Whether those causes are good or bad, it matters not to the
question before us. And this is to be understood of all those
who carry with them the heavy burden of their actions, having
in the few days of their life swiftly and hurriedly passed over
the stage of the imperial office, although the office itself has
lasted through long spaces of time, being filled by a constant
succession of dying men. If, however, even those benefits
which last only for the shortest time are to be ascribed to the aid
of the gods, these gladiators were not a little aided, who broke
the bonds of their servile condition, fled, escaped, raised a
great and most powerful army, obedient to the will and orders
of their chiefs and much feared by the Roman majesty, and
remaining unsubdued by several Roman generals, seized many
places, and, having won very many victories, enjoyed whatever
pleasures they wished, and did what their lust suggested,
and, until at last they were conquered, which was done with
the utmost difficulty, lived sublime and dominant. But let
us come to greater matters.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Concerning the covetousness of Ninus, who was the first who made war on his
neighbours, that he might rule more widely.</i></p>

<p>Justinus, who wrote Greek or rather foreign history in
Latin, and briefly, like Trogus Pompeius whom he followed,
begins his work thus: "In the beginning of the affairs of
peoples and nations the government was in the hands of kings,
who were raised to the height of this majesty not by courting
the people, but by the knowledge good men had of their moderation.
The people were held bound by no laws; the decisions
of the princes were instead of laws. It was the custom to
guard rather than to extend the boundaries of the empire; and
kingdoms were kept within the bounds of each ruler's native
land. Ninus king of the Assyrians first of all, through new
lust of empire, changed the old and, as it were, ancestral
custom of nations. He first made war on his neighbours,
and wholly subdued as far as to the frontiers of Libya the
nations as yet untrained to resist." And a little after he says:
"Ninus established by constant possession the greatness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
authority he had gained. Having mastered his nearest neighbours,
he went on to others, strengthened by the accession of
forces, and by making each fresh victory the instrument of
that which followed, subdued the nations of the whole East."
Now, with whatever fidelity to fact either he or Trogus may
in general have written&mdash;for that they sometimes told lies is
shown by other more trustworthy writers&mdash;yet it is agreed
among other authors, that the kingdom of the Assyrians was
extended far and wide by King Ninus. And it lasted so long,
that the Roman empire has not yet attained the same age;
for, as those write who have treated of chronological history,
this kingdom endured for twelve hundred and forty years
from the first year in which Ninus began to reign, until it
was transferred to the Medes. But to make war on your
neighbours, and thence to proceed to others, and through mere
lust of dominion to crush and subdue people who do you no
harm, what else is this to be called than great robbery?</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Whether earthly kingdoms in their rise and fall have been either aided or
deserted by the help of the gods.</i></p>

<p>If this kingdom was so great and lasting without the aid of
the gods, why is the ample territory and long duration of the
Roman empire to be ascribed to the Roman gods? For whatever
is the cause in it, the same is in the other also. But if
they contend that the prosperity of the other also is to be
attributed to the aid of the gods, I ask of which? For the
other nations whom Ninus overcame, did not then worship
other gods. Or if the Assyrians had gods of their own, who,
so to speak, were more skilful workmen in the construction
and preservation of the empire, whether are they dead, since
they themselves have also lost the empire; or, having been
defrauded of their pay, or promised a greater, have they chosen
rather to go over to the Medes, and from them again to the
Persians, because Cyrus invited them, and promised them
something still more advantageous? This nation, indeed,
since the time of the kingdom of Alexander the Macedonian,
which was as brief in duration as it was great in extent, has
preserved its own empire, and at this day occupies no small
territories in the East. If this is so, then either the gods are
unfaithful, who desert their own and go over to their enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
which Camillus, who was but a man, did not do, when, being
victor and subduer of a most hostile state, although he had
felt that Rome, for whom he had done so much, was ungrateful,
yet afterwards, forgetting the injury and remembering his
native land, he freed her again from the Gauls; or they are
not so strong as gods ought to be, since they can be overcome
by human skill or strength. Or if, when they carry on war
among themselves, the gods are not overcome by men, but
some gods who are peculiar to certain cities are perchance
overcome by other gods, it follows that they have quarrels
among themselves which they uphold, each for his own part.
Therefore a city ought not to worship its own gods, but rather
others who aid their own worshippers. Finally, whatever
may have been the case as to this change of sides, or flight,
or migration, or failure in battle on the part of the gods, the
name of Christ had not yet been proclaimed in those parts
of the earth when these kingdoms were lost and transferred
through great destructions in war. For if, after more than
twelve hundred years, when the kingdom was taken away
from the Assyrians, the Christian religion had there already
preached another eternal kingdom, and put a stop to the
sacrilegious worship of false gods, what else would the foolish
men of that nation have said, but that the kingdom which
had been so long preserved, could be lost for no other cause
than the desertion of their own religions and the reception of
Christianity? In which foolish speech that might have been
uttered, let those we speak of observe their own likeness, and
blush, if there is any sense of shame in them, because they
have uttered similar complaints; although the Roman empire
is afflicted rather than changed,&mdash;a thing which has befallen
it in other times also, before the name of Christ was heard,
and it has been restored after such affliction,&mdash;a thing which
even in these times is not to be despaired of. For who knows
the will of God concerning this matter?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>8. <i>Which of the gods can the Romans suppose presided over the increase and
preservation of their empire, when they have believed that even the care
of single things could scarcely be committed to single gods?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Next let us ask, if they please, out of so great a crowd of
gods which the Romans worship, whom in especial, or what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
gods they believe to have extended and preserved that empire.
Now, surely of this work, which is so excellent and so very
full of the highest dignity, they dare not ascribe any part to
the goddess Cloacina;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> or to Volupia, who has her appellation
from voluptuousness; or to Libentina, who has her name from
lust; or to Vaticanus, who presides over the screaming of
infants; or to Cunina, who rules over their cradles. But
how is it possible to recount in one part of this book all the
names of gods or goddesses, which they could scarcely comprise
in great volumes, distributing among these divinities
their peculiar offices about single things? They have not
even thought that the charge of their lands should be committed
to any one god: but they have entrusted their farms
to Rusina; the ridges of the mountains to Jugatinus; over
the downs they have set the goddess Collatina; over the
valleys, Vallonia. Nor could they even find one Segetia so
competent, that they could commend to her care all their corn
crops at once; but so long as their seed-corn was still under
the ground, they would have the goddess Seia set over it;
then, whenever it was above ground and formed straw, they
set over it the goddess Segetia; and when the grain was collected
and stored, they set over it the goddess Tutilina, that
it might be kept safe. Who would not have thought that
goddess Segetia sufficient to take care of the standing corn
until it had passed from the first green blades to the dry ears?
Yet she was not enough for men, who loved a multitude of
gods, that the miserable soul, despising the chaste embrace of
the one true God, should be prostituted to a crowd of demons.
Therefore they set Proserpina over the germinating seeds; over
the joints and knots of the stems, the god Nodotus; over the
sheaths enfolding the ears, the goddess Volutina; when the
sheaths opened that the spike might shoot forth, it was
ascribed to the goddess Patelana; when the stems stood all
equal with new ears, because the ancients described this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
equalizing by the term <i>hostire</i>, it was ascribed to the goddess
Hostilina; when the grain was in flower, it was dedicated to
the goddess Flora; when full of milk, to the god Lacturnus;
when maturing, to the goddess Matuta; when the crop was
runcated,&mdash;that is, removed from the soil,&mdash;to the goddess
Runcina. Nor do I yet recount them all, for I am sick of
all this, though it gives them no shame. Only, I have said
these very few things, in order that it may be understood
they dare by no means say that the Roman empire has been
established, increased, and preserved by their deities, who had
all their own functions assigned to them in such a way, that
no general oversight was entrusted to any one of them.
When, therefore, could Segetia take care of the empire, who
was not allowed to take care of the corn and the trees?
When could Cunina take thought about war, whose oversight
was not allowed to go beyond the cradles of the babies?
When could Nodotus give help in battle, who had nothing to
do even with the sheath of the ear, but only with the knots of
the joints? Every one sets a porter at the door of his house,
and because he is a man, he is quite sufficient; but these
people have set three gods, Forculus to the doors, Cardea to
the hinge, Limentinus to the threshold.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Thus Forculus could
not at the same time take care also of the hinge and the
threshold.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether the great extent and long duration of the Roman empire should be
ascribed to Jove, whom his worshippers believe to be the chief god.</i></p>

<p>Therefore omitting, or passing by for a little, that crowd of
petty gods, we ought to inquire into the part performed by
the great gods, whereby Rome has been made so great as to
reign so long over so many nations. Doubtless, therefore, this
is the work of Jove. For they will have it that he is
the king of all the gods and goddesses, as is shown by his
sceptre and by the Capitol on the lofty hill. Concerning that
god they publish a saying which, although that of a poet, is
most apt, "All things are full of Jove."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Varro believes that
this god is worshipped, although called by another name, even
by those who worship one God alone without any image. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
if this is so, why has he been so badly used at Rome (and
indeed by other nations too), that an image of him should be
made?&mdash;a thing which was so displeasing to Varro himself,
that although he was overborne by the perverse custom of so
great a city, he had not the least hesitation in both saying
and writing, that those who have appointed images for the
people have both taken away fear and added error.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>What opinions those have followed who have set divers gods over divers
parts of the world.</i></p>

<p>Why, also, is Juno united to him as his wife, who is called
at once "sister and yokefellow?"<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Because, say they, we have
Jove in the ether, Juno in the air; and these two elements are
united, the one being superior, the other inferior. It is not
he, then, of whom it is said, "All things are full of Jove," if
Juno also fills some part. Does each fill either, and are both
of this couple in both of these elements, and in each of them
at the same time? Why, then, is the ether given to Jove, the
air to Juno? Besides, these two should have been enough.
Why is it that the sea is assigned to Neptune, the earth to
Pluto? And that these also might not be left without mates,
Salacia is joined to Neptune, Proserpine to Pluto. For they
say that, as Juno possesses the lower part of the heavens,&mdash;that
is, the air,&mdash;so Salacia possesses the lower part of the sea, and
Proserpine the lower part of the earth. They seek how they
may patch up these fables, but they find no way. For if
these things were so, their ancient sages would have maintained
that there are three chief elements of the world, not
four, in order that each of the elements might have a pair of
gods. Now, they have positively affirmed that the ether is
one thing, the air another. But water, whether higher or
lower, is surely water. Suppose it ever so unlike, can it ever
be so much so as no longer to be water? And the lower
earth, by whatever divinity it may be distinguished, what else
can it be than earth? Lo, then, since the whole physical
world is complete in these four or three elements, where shall
Minerva be? What should she possess, what should she fill?
For she is placed in the Capitol along with these two, although
she is not the offspring of their marriage. Or if they say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
she possesses the higher part of the ether,&mdash;and on that account
the poets have feigned that she sprang from the head of Jove,&mdash;why
then is she not rather reckoned queen of the gods, because
she is superior to Jove? Is it because it would be improper
to set the daughter before the father? Why, then, is not
that rule of justice observed concerning Jove himself toward
Saturn? Is it because he was conquered? Have they fought
then? By no means, say they; that is an old wife's fable.
Lo, we are not to believe fables, and must hold more worthy
opinions concerning the gods! Why, then, do they not assign
to the father of Jove a seat, if not of higher, at least of equal
honour? Because Saturn, say they, is length of time.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Therefore
they who worship Saturn worship Time; and it is insinuated
that Jupiter, the king of the gods, was born of Time. For
is anything unworthy said when Jupiter and Juno are said to
have been sprung from Time, if he is the heaven and she is
the earth, since both heaven and earth have been made, and
are therefore not eternal? For their learned and wise men
have this also in their books. Nor is that saying taken by
Virgil out of poetic figments, but out of the books of philosophers,</p>

<p>&mdash;that is, into the bosom of Tellus, or the earth. Although
here, also, they will have it that there are some differences,
and think that in the earth herself Terra is one thing, Tellus
another, and Tellumo another. And they have all these as
gods, called by their own names, distinguished by their own
offices, and venerated with their own altars and rites. This
same earth also they call the mother of the gods, so that even
the fictions of the poets are more tolerable, if, according, not
to their poetical but sacred books, Juno is not only the sister
and wife, but also the mother of Jove. The same earth they
worship as Ceres, and also as Vesta; while yet they more
frequently affirm that Vesta is nothing else than fire, pertaining
to the hearths, without which the city cannot exist; and
therefore virgins are wont to serve her, because as nothing is
born of a virgin, so nothing is born of fire;&mdash;but all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
nonsense ought to be completely abolished and extinguished by
Him who is born of a virgin. For who can bear that, while
they ascribe to the fire so much honour, and, as it were,
chastity, they do not blush sometimes even to call Vesta
Venus, so that honoured virginity may vanish in her handmaidens?
For if Vesta is Venus, how can virgins rightly
serve her by abstaining from venery? Are there two Venuses,
the one a virgin, the other not a maid? Or rather, are there
three, one the goddess of virgins, who is also called Vesta,
another the goddess of wives, and another of harlots? To
her also the Phenicians offered a gift by prostituting their
daughters before they united them to husbands.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Which of
these is the wife of Vulcan? Certainly not the virgin, since
she has a husband. Far be it from us to say it is the harlot,
lest we should seem to wrong the son of Juno and fellow-worker
of Minerva. Therefore it is to be understood that
she belongs to the married people; but we would not wish
them to imitate her in what she did with Mars. "Again,"
say they, "you return to fables." What sort of justice is
that, to be angry with us because we say such things of their
gods, and not to be angry with themselves, who in their
theatres most willingly behold the crimes of their gods?
And,&mdash;a thing incredible, if it were not thoroughly well
proved,&mdash;these very theatric representations of the crimes
of their gods have been instituted in honour of these same
gods.</p>

<p>Let them therefore assert as many things as ever they
please in physical reasonings and disputations. One while let
Jupiter be the soul of this corporeal world, who fills and
moves that whole mass, constructed and compacted out of
four, or as many elements as they please; another while, let
him yield to his sister and brothers their parts of it: now let
him be the ether, that from above he may embrace Juno, the
air spread out beneath; again, let him be the whole heaven
along with the air, and impregnate with fertilizing showers
and seeds the earth, as his wife, and, at the same time, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
mother (for this is not vile in divine beings); and yet again
(that it may not be necessary to run through them all), let
him, the one god, of whom many think it has been said by
a most noble poet,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>let it be him who in the ether is Jupiter; in the air, Juno;
in the sea, Neptune; in the lower parts of the sea, Salacia;
in the earth, Pluto; in the lower part of the earth, Proserpine;
on the domestic hearths, Vesta; in the furnace of the workmen,
Vulcan; among the stars, Sol, and Luna, and the Stars; in
divination, Apollo; in merchandise, Mercury; in Janus, the
initiator; in Terminus, the terminator; Saturn, in time; Mars
and Bellona, in war; Liber, in vineyards; Ceres, in corn-fields;
Diana, in forests; Minerva, in learning. Finally, let it be him
who is in that crowd, as it were, of plebeian gods: let him
preside under the name of Liber over the seed of men, and
under that of Libera over that of women: let him be Diespiter,
who brings forth the birth to the light of day: let him
be the goddess Mena, whom they set over the menstruation
of women: let him be Lucina, who is invoked by women in
childbirth: let him bring help to those who are being born, by
taking them up from the bosom of the earth, and let him be
called Opis: let him open the mouth in the crying babe, and
be called the god Vaticanus: let him lift it from the earth,
and be called the goddess Levana; let him watch over cradles,
and be called the goddess Cunina: let it be no other than
he who is in those goddesses, who sing the fates of the
new born, and are called Carmentes: let him preside over
fortuitous events, and be called Fortuna: in the goddess
Rumina, let him milk out the breast to the little one, because
the ancients termed the breast <i>ruma</i>: in the goddess Potina,
let him administer drink: in the goddess Educa, let him supply
food: from the terror of infants, let him be styled Paventia:
from the hope which comes, Venilia; from voluptuousness,
Volupia; from action, Agenor: from the stimulants by which
man is spurred on to much action, let him be named the goddess
Stimula: let him be the goddess Strenia, for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
strenuous; Numeria, who teaches to number; Cam&#339;na, who
teaches to sing: let him be both the god Consus for granting
counsel, and the goddess Sentia for inspiring sentences: let
him be the goddess Juventas, who, after the robe of boyhood
is laid aside, takes charge of the beginning of the youthful
age: let him be Fortuna Barbata, who endues adults with a
beard, whom they have not chosen to honour; so that this
divinity, whatever it may be, should at least be a male god,
named either Barbatus, from <i>barba</i>, like Nodotus, from <i>nodus</i>;
or, certainly, not Fortuna, but because he has beards, Fortunius:
let him, in the god Jugatinus, yoke couples in marriage;
and when the girdle of the virgin wife is loosed, let
him be invoked as the goddess Virginiensis: let him be
Mutunus or Tuternus, who, among the Greeks, is called
Priapus. If they are not ashamed of it, let all these which
I have named, and whatever others I have not named (for I
have not thought fit to name all), let all these gods and
goddesses be that one Jupiter, whether, as some will have it,
all these are parts of him, or are his powers, as those think
who are pleased to consider him the soul of the world, which
is the opinion of most of their doctors, and these the greatest.
If these things are so (how evil they may be I do not yet
meanwhile inquire), what would they lose, if they, by a more
prudent abridgment, should worship one god? For what part
of him could be contemned if he himself should be worshipped?
But if they are afraid lest parts of him should be angry at
being passed by or neglected, then it is not the case, as they
will have it, that this whole is as the life of one living being,
which contains all the gods together, as if they were its virtues,
or members, or parts; but each part has its own life
separate from the rest, if it is so that one can be angered,
appeased, or stirred up more than another. But if it is said
that all together,&mdash;that is, the whole Jove himself,&mdash;would be
offended if his parts were not also worshipped singly and
minutely, it is foolishly spoken. Surely none of them could
be passed by if he who singly possesses them all should be
worshipped. For, to omit other things which are innumerable,
when they say that all the stars are parts of Jove,
and are all alive, and have rational souls, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
without controversy are gods, can they not see how many they
do not worship, to how many they do not build temples or
set up altars, and to how very few, in fact, of the stars they
have thought of setting them up and offering sacrifice? If,
therefore, those are displeased who are not severally worshipped,
do they not fear to live with only a few appeased,
while all heaven is displeased? But if they worship all the
stars because they are part of Jove whom they worship, by
the same compendious method they could supplicate them all
in him alone. For in this way no one would be displeased,
since in him alone all would be supplicated. No one would
be contemned, instead of there being just cause of displeasure
given to the much greater number who are passed by in the
worship offered to some; especially when Priapus, stretched
out in vile nakedness, is preferred to those who shine from
their supernal abode.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Concerning the opinion of those who have thought that God is the soul of
the world, and the world is the body of God.</i></p>

<p>Ought not men of intelligence, and indeed men of every
kind, to be stirred up to examine the nature of this opinion?
For there is no need of excellent capacity for this task, that
putting away the desire of contention, they may observe that
if God is the soul of the world, and the world is as a body
to Him, who is the soul, He must be one living being consisting
of soul and body, and that this same God is a kind of
womb of nature containing all things in Himself, so that the
lives and souls of all living things are taken, according to the
manner of each one's birth, out of His soul which vivifies that
whole mass, and therefore nothing at all remains which is not
a part of God. And if this is so, who cannot see what impious
and irreligious consequences follow, such as that whatever
one may trample, he must trample a part of God, and in
slaying any living creature, a part of God must be slaughtered?
But I am unwilling to utter all that may occur to those who
think of it, yet cannot be spoken without irreverence.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Concerning those who assert that only rational animals are parts of
the one God.</i></p>

<p>But if they contend that only rational animals, such as
men, are parts of God, I do not really see how, if the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
world is God, they can separate beasts from being parts of Him.
But what need is there of striving about that? Concerning the
rational animal himself,&mdash;that is, man,&mdash;what more unhappy
belief can be entertained than that a part of God is whipped
when a boy is whipped? And who, unless he is quite mad,
could bear the thought that parts of God can become lascivious,
iniquitous, impious, and altogether damnable? In brief, why
is God angry at those who do not worship Him, since these
offenders are parts of Himself? It remains, therefore, that
they must say that all the gods have their own lives; that
each one lives for himself, and none of them is a part of any
one; but that all are to be worshipped,&mdash;at least as many as
can be known and worshipped; for they are so many it is
impossible that all can be so. And of all these, I believe
that Jupiter, because he presides as king, is thought by them
to have both established and extended the Roman empire.
For if he has not done it, what other god do they believe
could have attempted so great a work, when they must all
be occupied with their own offices and works, nor can one
intrude on that of another? Could the kingdom of men then
be propagated and increased by the king of the gods?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>14. <i>The enlargement of kingdoms is unsuitably ascribed to Jove; for if, as they
will have it, Victoria is a goddess, she alone would suffice for this business.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Here, first of all, I ask, why even the kingdom itself is not
some god? For why should not it also be so, if Victory is
a goddess? Or what need is there of Jove himself in this
affair, if Victory favours and is propitious, and always goes to
those whom she wishes to be victorious? With this goddess
favourable and propitious, even if Jove was idle and did
nothing, what nations could remain unsubdued, what kingdom
would not yield? But perhaps it is displeasing to good
men to fight with most wicked unrighteousness, and provoke
with voluntary war neighbours who are peaceable and do no
wrong, in order to enlarge a kingdom? If they feel thus, I
entirely approve and praise them.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Whether it is suitable for good men to wish to rule more widely.</i></p>

<p>Let them ask, then, whether it is quite fitting for good
men to rejoice in extended empire. For the iniquity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
those with whom just wars are carried on favours the growth
of a kingdom, which would certainly have been small if the
peace and justice of neighbours had not by any wrong provoked
the carrying on of war against them; and human affairs
being thus more happy, all kingdoms would have been small,
rejoicing in neighbourly concord; and thus there would have
been very many kingdoms of nations in the world, as there
are very many houses of citizens in a city. Therefore, to
carry on war and extend a kingdom over wholly subdued
nations seems to bad men to be felicity, to good men necessity.
But because it would be worse that the injurious should
rule over those who are more righteous, therefore even that is
not unsuitably called felicity. But beyond doubt it is greater
felicity to have a good neighbour at peace, than to conquer a
bad one by making war. Your wishes are bad, when you
desire that one whom you hate or fear should be in such a
condition that you can conquer him. If, therefore, by carrying
on wars that were just, not impious or unrighteous, the
Romans could have acquired so great an empire, ought they not
to worship as a goddess even the injustice of foreigners? For
we see that this has co-operated much in extending the empire,
by making foreigners so unjust that they became people with
whom just wars might be carried on, and the empire increased.
And why may not injustice, at least that of foreign nations,
also be a goddess, if Fear and Dread, and Ague have deserved
to be Roman gods? By these two, therefore,&mdash;that is, by
foreign injustice, and the goddess Victoria, for injustice stirs
up causes of wars, and Victoria brings these same wars to a
happy termination,&mdash;the empire has increased, even although
Jove has been idle. For what part could Jove have here,
when those things which might be thought to be his benefits
are held to be gods, called gods, worshipped as gods, and are
themselves invoked for their own parts? He also might have
some part here, if he himself might be called Empire, just as
she is called Victory. Or if empire is the gift of Jove, why
may not victory also be held to be his gift? And it certainly
would have been held to be so, had he been recognised and
worshipped, not as a stone in the Capitol, but as the true
King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>16. <i>What was the reason why the Romans, in detailing separate gods for all
things and all movements of the mind, chose to have the temple of Quiet
outside the gates.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But I wonder very much, that while they assigned to separate
gods single things, and (well nigh) all movements of the mind;
that while they invoked the goddess Agenoria, who should
excite to action; the goddess Stimula, who should stimulate
to unusual action; the goddess Murcia, who should not move
men beyond measure, but make them, as Pomponius says,
<i>murcid</i>&mdash;that is, too slothful and inactive; the goddess
Strenua, who should make them strenuous; and that while
they offered to all these gods and goddesses solemn and public
worship, they should yet have been unwilling to give public
acknowledgment to her whom they name Quies because she
makes men quiet, but built her temple outside the Colline
gate. Whether was this a symptom of an unquiet mind, or
rather was it thus intimated that he who should persevere in
worshipping that crowd, not, to be sure, of gods, but of demons,
could not dwell with quiet; to which the true Physician calls,
saying, "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and
ye shall find rest unto your souls?"</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Whether, if the highest power belongs to Jove, Victoria also ought to be
worshipped.</i></p>

<p>Or do they say, perhaps, that Jupiter sends the goddess
Victoria, and that she, as it were, acting in obedience to the
king of the gods, comes to those to whom he may have despatched
her, and takes up her quarters on their side? This
is truly said, not of Jove, whom they, according to their own
imagination, feign to be king of the gods, but of Him who is
the true eternal King, because he sends, not Victory, who is
no person, but His angel, and causes whom He pleases to conquer;
whose counsel may be hidden, but cannot be unjust.
For if Victory is a goddess, why is not Triumph also a god,
and joined to Victory either as husband, or brother, or son?
Indeed, they have imagined such things concerning the gods,
that if the poets had feigned the like, and they should have
been discussed by us, they would have replied that they were
laughable figments of the poets not to be attributed to true
deities. And yet they themselves did not laugh when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
were, not reading in the poets, but worshipping in the temples
such doating follies. Therefore they should entreat Jove
alone for all things, and supplicate him only. For if Victory
is a goddess, and is under him as her king, wherever he might
have sent her, she could not dare to resist and do her own
will rather than his.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>With what reason they who think Felicity and Fortune goddesses have
distinguished them.</i></p>

<p>What shall we say, besides, of the idea that Felicity also is
a goddess? She has received a temple; she has merited an
altar; suitable rites of worship are paid to her. She alone,
then, should be worshipped. For where she is present, what
good thing can be absent? But what does a man wish, that
he thinks Fortune also a goddess and worships her? Is felicity
one thing, fortune another? Fortune, indeed, may be bad
as well as good; but felicity, if it could be bad, would not be
felicity. Certainly we ought to think all the gods of either
sex (if they also have sex) are only good. This says Plato;
this say other philosophers; this say all estimable rulers
of the republic and the nations. How is it, then, that the
goddess Fortune is sometimes good, sometimes bad? Is it
perhaps the case that when she is bad she is not a goddess,
but is suddenly changed into a malignant demon? How
many Fortunes are there then? Just as many as there are
men who are fortunate, that is, of good fortune. But since
there must also be very many others who at the very same
time are men of bad fortune, could she, being one and the
same Fortune, be at the same time both bad and good&mdash;the
one to these, the other to those? She who is the goddess, is
she always good? Then she herself is felicity. Why, then,
are two names given her? Yet this is tolerable; for it is
customary that one thing should be called by two names.
But why different temples, different altars, different rituals?
There is a reason, say they, because Felicity is she whom the
good have by previous merit; but fortune, which is termed
good without any trial of merit, befalls both good and bad
men fortuitously, whence also she is named Fortune. How,
therefore, is she good, who without any discernment comes
both to the good and to the bad? Why is she worshipped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
who is thus blind, running at random on any one whatever,
so that for the most part she passes by her worshippers, and
cleaves to those who despise her? Or if her worshippers
profit somewhat, so that they are seen by her and loved, then
she follows merit, and does not come fortuitously. What,
then, becomes of that definition of fortune? What becomes
of the opinion that she has received her very name from fortuitous
events? For it profits one nothing to worship her if
she is truly <i>fortune</i>. But if she distinguishes her worshippers,
so that she may benefit them, she is not fortune. Or does
Jupiter send her too, whither he pleases? Then let him alone
be worshipped; because Fortune is not able to resist him
when he commands her, and sends her where he pleases. Or,
at least, let the bad worship her, who do not choose to have
merit by which the goddess Felicity might be invited.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Concerning Fortuna Muliebris.</i><a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>To this supposed deity, whom they call Fortuna, they
ascribe so much, indeed, that they have a tradition that the
image of her, which was dedicated by the Roman matrons, and
called Fortuna Muliebris, has spoken, and has said, once and
again, that the matrons pleased her by their homage; which,
indeed, if it is true, ought not to excite our wonder. For it
is not so difficult for malignant demons to deceive, and they
ought the rather to advert to their wits and wiles, because it
is that goddess who comes by haphazard who has spoken,
and not she who comes to reward merit. For Fortuna was
loquacious, and Felicitas mute; and for what other reason
but that men might not care to live rightly, having made
Fortuna their friend, who could make them fortunate without
any good desert? And truly, if Fortuna speaks, she should at
least speak, not with a womanly, but with a manly voice; lest
they themselves who have dedicated the image should think
so great a miracle has been wrought by feminine loquacity.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>20. <i>Concerning Virtue and Faith, which the pagans have honoured with temples
and sacred rites, passing by other good qualities, which ought likewise to
have been worshipped, if deity was rightly attributed to these.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>They have made Virtue also a goddess, which, indeed, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
could be a goddess, had been preferable to many. And now,
because it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, let <i>it</i> be obtained
by prayer from Him, by whom alone it can be given, and the
whole crowd of false gods vanishes. But why is Faith believed
to be a goddess, and why does she herself receive temple and
altar? For whoever prudently acknowledges her makes his
own self an abode for her. But how do they know what
faith is, of which it is the prime and greatest function that
the true God may be believed in? But why had not virtue
sufficed? Does it not include faith also? Forasmuch as
they have thought proper to distribute virtue into four divisions&mdash;prudence,
justice, fortitude, and temperance&mdash;and as
each of these divisions has its own virtues, faith is among the
parts of justice, and has the chief place with as many of us as
know what that saying means, "The just shall live by faith."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
But if Faith is a goddess, I wonder why these keen lovers of a
multitude of gods have wronged so many other goddesses, by
passing them by, when they could have dedicated temples and
altars to them likewise. Why has temperance not deserved
to be a goddess, when some Roman princes have obtained no
small glory on account of her? Why, in fine, is fortitude not
a goddess, who aided Mucius when he thrust his right hand
into the flames; who aided Curtius, when for the sake of his
country he threw himself headlong into the yawning earth;
who aided Decius the sire, and Decius the son, when they
devoted themselves for the army?&mdash;though we might question
whether these men had <i>true</i> fortitude, if this concerned
our present discussion. Why have prudence and wisdom
merited no place among the gods? Is it because they are
all worshipped under the general name of Virtue itself?
Then they could thus worship the true God also, of whom
all the other gods are thought to be parts. But in that one
name of virtue is comprehended both faith and chastity, which
yet have obtained separate altars in temples of their own.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap21"></a>21. <i>That although not understanding them to be the gifts of God, they ought at
least to have been content with Virtue and Felicity.</i></p>

<p>These, not verity but vanity has made goddesses. For
these are gifts of the true God, not themselves goddesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
However, where virtue and felicity are, what else is sought
for? What can suffice the man whom virtue and felicity do
not suffice? For surely virtue comprehends all things we
need do, felicity all things we need wish for. If Jupiter,
then, was worshipped in order that he might give these two
things,&mdash;because, if extent and duration of empire is something
good, it pertains to this same felicity,&mdash;why is it not understood
that they are not goddesses, but the gifts of God? But
if they are judged to be goddesses, then at least that other
great crowd of gods should not be sought after. For, having
considered all the offices which their fancy has distributed
among the various gods and goddesses, let them find out, if
they can, anything which could be bestowed by any god whatever
on a man possessing virtue, possessing felicity. What
instruction could be sought either from Mercury or Minerva,
when Virtue already possessed all in herself? Virtue, indeed,
is defined by the ancients as itself the art of living well and
rightly. Hence, because virtue is called in Greek &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8052;, it
has been thought the Latins have derived from it the term
<i>art</i>. But if Virtue cannot come except to the clever, what
need was there of the god Father Catius, who should make
men cautious, that is, acute, when Felicity could confer this?
Because, to be born clever belongs to felicity. Whence,
although goddess Felicity could not be worshipped by one
not yet born, in order that, being made his friend, she might
bestow this on him, yet she might confer this favour on
parents who were her worshippers, that clever children should
be born to them. What need had women in childbirth to
invoke Lucina, when, if Felicity should be present, they
would have, not only a good delivery, but good children too?
What need was there to commend the children to the goddess
Ops when they were being born; to the god Vaticanus in
their birth-cry; to the goddess Cunina when lying cradled;
to the goddess Rumina when sucking; to the god Statilinus
when standing; to the goddess Adeona when coming; to
Abeona when going away; to the goddess Mens that they
might have a good mind; to the god Volumnus, and the
goddess Volumna, that they might wish for good things; to
the nuptial gods, that they might make good matches; to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
rural gods, and chiefly to the goddess Fructesca herself, that
they might receive the most abundant fruits; to Mars and
Bellona, that they might carry on war well; to the goddess
Victoria, that they might be victorious; to the god Honor,
that they might be honoured; to the goddess Pecunia, that
they might have plenty money; to the god Aesculanus, and
his son Argentinus, that they might have brass and silver
coin? For they set down Aesculanus as the father of Argentinus
for this reason, that brass coin began to be used before
silver. But I wonder Argentinus has not begotten Aurinus,
since gold coin also has followed. Could they have him for a
god, they would prefer Aurinus both to his father Argentinus
and his grandfather Aesculanus, just as they set Jove before
Saturn. Therefore, what necessity was there on account of
these gifts, either of soul, or body, or outward estate, to worship
and invoke so great a crowd of gods, all of whom I have not
mentioned, nor have they themselves been able to provide for
all human benefits, minutely and singly methodized, minute
and single gods, when the one goddess Felicity was able,
with the greatest ease, compendiously to bestow the whole
of them? nor should any other be sought after, either for the
bestowing of good things, or for the averting of evil. For
why should they invoke the goddess Fessonia for the weary;
for driving away enemies, the goddess Pellonia; for the sick,
as a physician, either Apollo or Æsculapius, or both together
if there should be great danger? Neither should the god
Spiniensis be entreated that he might root out the thorns
from the fields; nor the goddess Rubigo that the mildew
might not come,&mdash;Felicitas alone being present and guarding,
either no evils would have arisen, or they would have been
quite easily driven away. Finally, since we treat of these
two goddesses, Virtue and Felicity, if felicity is the reward of
virtue, she is not a goddess, but a gift of God. But if she is
a goddess, why may she not be said to confer virtue itself,
inasmuch as it is a great felicity to attain virtue?</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Concerning the knowledge of the worship due to the gods, which Varro
glories in having himself conferred on the Romans.</i></p>

<p>What is it, then, that Varro boasts he has bestowed as a
very great benefit on his fellow-citizens, because he not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
recounts the gods who ought to be worshipped by the Romans,
but also tells what pertains to each of them? "Just as it is
of no advantage," he says, "to know the name and appearance
of any man who is a physician, and not know that he is a
physician, so," he says, "it is of no advantage to know well
that Æsculapius is a god, if you are not aware that he can
bestow the gift of health, and consequently do not know why
you ought to supplicate him." He also affirms this by another
comparison, saying, "No one is able, not only to live well, but
even to live at all, if he does not know who is a smith, who a
baker, who a weaver, from whom he can seek any utensil,
whom he may take for a helper, whom for a leader, whom for a
teacher;" asserting, "that in this way it can be doubtful to no
one, that thus the knowledge of the gods is useful, if one can
know what force, and faculty, or power any god may have in
anything. For from this we may be able," he says, "to know
what god we ought to call to, and invoke for any cause; lest
we should do as too many are wont to do, and desire water
from Liber, and wine from Lymphs." Very useful, forsooth!
Who would not give this man thanks if he could show true
things, and if he could teach that the one true God, from whom
all good things are, is to be worshipped by men?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap23"></a>23. <i>Concerning Felicity, whom the Romans, who venerate many gods, for a long
time did not worship with divine honour, though she alone would have
sufficed instead of all.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But how does it happen, if their books and rituals are true,
and Felicity is a goddess, that she herself is not appointed as
the only one to be worshipped, since she could confer all
things, and all at once make men happy? For who wishes
anything for any other reason than that he may become
happy? Why was it left to Lucullus to dedicate a temple
to so great a goddess at so late a date, and after so many
Roman rulers? Why did Romulus himself, ambitious as he
was of founding a fortunate city, not erect a temple to this
goddess before all others? Why did he supplicate the other
gods for anything, since he would have lacked nothing had she
been with him? For even he himself would neither have
been first a king, then afterwards, as they think, a god, if this
goddess had not been propitious to him. Why, therefore, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he appoint as gods for the Romans, Janus, Jove, Mars, Picus,
Faunus, Tiberinus, Hercules, and others, if there were more of
them? Why did Titus Tatius add Saturn, Ops, Sun, Moon,
Vulcan, Light, and whatever others he added, among whom
was even the goddess Cloacina, while Felicity was neglected?
Why did Numa appoint so many gods and so many goddesses
without this one? Was it perhaps because he could not see
her among so great a crowd? Certainly king Hostilius would
not have introduced the new gods Fear and Dread to be propitiated,
if he could have known or might have worshipped this
goddess. For, in presence of Felicity, Fear and Dread would
have disappeared,&mdash;I do not say propitiated, but put to flight.
Next, I ask, how is it that the Roman empire had already
immensely increased before any one worshipped Felicity? Was
the empire, therefore, more great than happy? For how could
true felicity be there, where there was not true piety? For
piety is the genuine worship of the true God, and not the worship
of as many demons as there are false gods. Yet even
afterwards, when Felicity had already been taken into the
number of the gods, the great infelicity of the civil wars
ensued. Was Felicity perhaps justly indignant, both because
she was invited so late, and was invited not to honour, but
rather to reproach, because along with her were worshipped
Priapus, and Cloacina, and Fear and Dread, and Ague, and
others which were not gods to be worshipped, but the crimes
of the worshippers? Last of all, if it seemed good to worship
so great a goddess along with a most unworthy crowd, why at
least was she not worshipped in a more honourable way than
the rest? For is it not intolerable that Felicity is placed
neither among the gods <i>Consentes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> whom they allege to be
admitted into the council of Jupiter, nor among the gods whom
they term <i>Select</i>? Some temple might be made for her which
might be pre-eminent, both in loftiness of site and dignity of
style. Why, indeed, not something better than is made for
Jupiter himself? For who gave the kingdom even to Jupiter
but Felicity? I am supposing that when he reigned he was
happy. Felicity, however, is certainly more valuable than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
kingdom. For no one doubts that a man might easily be
found who may fear to be made a king; but no one is found
who is unwilling to be happy. Therefore, if it is thought they
can be consulted by augury, or in any other way, the gods themselves
should be consulted about this thing, whether they may
wish to give place to Felicity. If, perchance, the place should
already be occupied by the temples and altars of others, where
a greater and more lofty temple might be built to Felicity,
even Jupiter himself might give way, so that Felicity might
rather obtain the very pinnacle of the Capitoline hill. For
there is not any one who would resist Felicity, except, which
is impossible, one who might wish to be unhappy. Certainly,
if he should be consulted, Jupiter would in no case do what
those three gods, Mars, Terminus, and Juventas, did, who positively
refused to give place to their superior and king. For,
as their books record, when king Tarquin wished to construct
the Capitol, and perceived that the place which seemed to him
to be the most worthy and suitable was preoccupied by other
gods, not daring to do anything contrary to their pleasure, and
believing that they would willingly give place to a god who
was so great, and was their own master, because there were
many of them there when the Capitol was founded, he inquired
by augury whether they chose to give place to Jupiter, and
they were all willing to remove thence except those whom I
have named, Mars, Terminus, and Juventas; and therefore the
Capitol was built in such a way that these three also might be
within it, yet with such obscure signs that even the most learned
men could scarcely know this. Surely, then, Jupiter himself
would by no means despise Felicity as he was himself despised
by Terminus, Mars, and Juventas. But even they themselves
who had not given place to Jupiter, would certainly give place
to Felicity, who had made Jupiter king over them. Or if they
should not give place, they would act thus not out of contempt
of her, but because they chose rather to be obscure in the house
of Felicity, than to be eminent without her in their own places.</p>

<p>Thus the goddess Felicity being established in the largest
and loftiest place, the citizens should learn whence the furtherance
of every good desire should be sought. And so, by the
persuasion of nature herself, the superfluous multitude of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
gods being abandoned, Felicity alone would be worshipped,
prayer would be made to her alone, her temple alone would
be frequented by the citizens who wished to be happy, which
no one of them would not wish; and thus felicity, who was
sought for from all the gods, would be sought for only from
her own self. For who wishes to receive from any god anything
else than felicity, or what he supposes to tend to felicity?
Wherefore, if Felicity has it in her power to be with what
man she pleases (and she has it if she is a goddess), what folly
is it, after all, to seek from any other god her whom you can
obtain by request from her own self! Therefore they ought to
honour this goddess above other gods, even by dignity of place.
For, as we read in their own authors, the ancient Romans paid
greater honours to I know not what Summanus, to whom they
attributed nocturnal thunderbolts, than to Jupiter, to whom
diurnal thunderbolts were held to pertain. But, after a famous
and conspicuous temple had been built to Jupiter, owing to
the dignity of the building, the multitude resorted to him in
so great numbers, that scarce one can be found who remembers
even to have read the name of Summanus, which now he cannot
once hear named. But if Felicity is not a goddess, because, as
is true, it is a gift of God, that god must be sought who has
power to give it, and that hurtful multitude of false gods must
be abandoned which the vain multitude of foolish men follows
after, making gods to itself of the gifts of God, and offending
Himself whose gifts they are by the stubbornness of a proud
will. For he cannot be free from infelicity who worships
Felicity as a goddess, and forsakes God, the giver of felicity;
just as he cannot be free from hunger who licks a painted loaf
of bread, and does not buy it of the man who has a real one.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>The reasons by which the pagans attempt to defend their worshipping
among the gods the divine gifts themselves.</i></p>

<p>We may, however, consider their reasons. Is it to be
believed, say they, that our forefathers were besotted even to
such a degree as not to know that these things are divine
gifts, and not gods? But as they knew that such things are
granted to no one, except by some god freely bestowing them,
they called the gods whose names they did not find out by the
names of those things which they deemed to be given by them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
sometimes slightly altering the name for that purpose, as, for
example, from war they have named Bellona, not <i>bellum</i>; from
cradles, Cunina, not <i>cunæ</i>; from standing corn, Segetia, not <i>seges</i>;
from apples, Pomona, not <i>pomum</i>; from oxen, Bubona, not <i>bos</i>.
Sometimes, again, with no alteration of the word, just as the
things themselves are named, so that the goddess who gives
money is called Pecunia, and money is not thought to be itself
a goddess: so of Virtus, who gives virtue; Honor, who gives
honour; Concordia, who gives concord; Victoria, who gives
victory. So, they say, when Felicitas is called a goddess, what
is meant is not the thing itself which is given, but that deity
by whom felicity is given.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Concerning the one God only to be worshipped, who, although His name is
unknown, is yet deemed to be the giver of felicity.</i></p>

<p>Having had that reason rendered to us, we shall perhaps
much more easily persuade, as we wish, those whose heart has
not become too much hardened. For if now human infirmity
has perceived that felicity cannot be given except by some
god; if this was perceived by those who worshipped so many
gods, at whose head they set Jupiter himself; if, in their
ignorance of the name of Him by whom felicity was given,
they agreed to call Him by the name of that very thing which
they believed He gave;&mdash;then it follows that they thought
that felicity could not be given even by Jupiter himself, whom
they already worshipped, but certainly by him whom they
thought fit to worship under the name of Felicity itself. I
thoroughly affirm the statement that they believed felicity to
be given by a certain God whom they knew not: let Him
therefore be sought after, let Him be worshipped, and it is
enough. Let the train of innumerable demons be repudiated,
and let this God suffice every man whom his gift suffices. For
him, I say, God the giver of felicity will not be enough to
worship, for whom felicity itself is not enough to receive.
But let him for whom it suffices (and man has nothing more
he ought to wish for) serve the one God, the giver of felicity.
This God is not he whom they call Jupiter. For if they
acknowledged him to be the giver of felicity, they would not
seek, under the name of Felicity itself, for another god or goddess
by whom felicity might be given; nor could they tolerate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Jupiter himself should be worshipped with such infamous attributes.
For he is said to be the debaucher of the wives of others;
he is the shameless lover and ravisher of a beautiful boy.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Of the scenic plays, the celebration of which the gods have exacted from
their worshippers.</i></p>

<p>"But," says Cicero, "Homer invented these things, and
transferred things human to the gods: I would rather transfer
things divine to us."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The poet, by ascribing such crimes to
the gods, has justly displeased the grave man. Why, then, are
the scenic plays, where these crimes are habitually spoken of,
acted, exhibited, in honour of the gods, reckoned among things
divine by the most learned men? Cicero should exclaim, not
against the inventions of the poets, but against the customs of
the ancients. Would not they have exclaimed in reply, What
have we done? The gods themselves have loudly demanded
that these plays should be exhibited in their honour, have
fiercely exacted them, have menaced destruction unless this
was performed, have avenged its neglect with great severity,
and have manifested pleasure at the reparation of such neglect.
Among their virtuous and wonderful deeds the following is
related. It was announced in a dream to Titus Latinius, a
Roman rustic, that he should go to the senate and tell them
to recommence the games of Rome, because on the first day
of their celebration a condemned criminal had been led to
punishment in sight of the people, an incident so sad as to
disturb the gods who were seeking amusement from the
games. And when the peasant who had received this intimation
was afraid on the following day to deliver it to the
senate, it was renewed next night in a severer form: he
lost his son, because of his neglect. On the third night
he was warned that a yet graver punishment was impending,
if he should still refuse obedience. When even thus
he did not dare to obey, he fell into a virulent and horrible
disease. But then, on the advice of his friends, he gave
information to the magistrates, and was carried in a litter
into the senate, and having, on declaring his dream, immediately
recovered strength, went away on his own feet whole.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
The senate, amazed at so great a miracle, decreed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
games should be renewed at fourfold cost. What sensible
man does not see that men, being put upon by malignant
demons, from whose domination nothing save the grace of
God through Jesus Christ our Lord sets free, have been compelled
by force to exhibit to such gods as these, plays which,
if well advised, they should condemn as shameful? Certain it
is that in these plays the poetic crimes of the gods are celebrated,
yet they are plays which were re-established by decree
of the senate, under compulsion of the gods. In these plays
the most shameless actors celebrated Jupiter as the corrupter
of chastity, and thus gave him pleasure. If that was a fiction,
he would have been moved to anger; but if he was delighted
with the representation of his crimes, even although fabulous,
then, when he happened to be worshipped, who but the devil
could be served? Is it so that he could found, extend, and
preserve the Roman empire, who was more vile than any
Roman man whatever, to whom such things were displeasing?
Could he give felicity who was so infelicitously worshipped,
and who, unless he should be thus worshipped, was yet more
infelicitously provoked to anger?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Concerning the three kinds of gods about which the pontiff Scævola has
discoursed.</i></p>

<p>It is recorded that the very learned pontiff Scævola<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> had
distinguished about three kinds of gods&mdash;one introduced by
the poets, another by the philosophers, another by the statesmen.
The first kind he declares to be trifling, because many
unworthy things have been invented by the poets concerning
the gods; the second does not suit states, because it contains
some things that are superfluous, and some, too, which it would
be prejudicial for the people to know. It is no great matter
about the superfluous things, for it is a common saying of
skilful lawyers, "Superfluous things do no harm."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> But what
are those things which do harm when brought before the
multitude? "These," he says, "that Hercules, Æsculapius,
Castor and Pollux, are not gods; for it is declared by learned
men that these were but men, and yielded to the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
lot of mortals." What else? "That states have not the
true images of the gods; because the true God has neither
sex, nor age, nor definite corporeal members." The pontiff is
not willing that the people should know these things; for he
does not think they are false. He thinks it expedient, therefore,
that states should be deceived in matters of religion;
which Varro himself does not hesitate even to say in his
books about things divine. Excellent religion! to which the
weak, who requires to be delivered, may flee for succour; and
when he seeks for the truth by which he may be delivered, it
is believed to be expedient for him that he be deceived. And,
truly, in these same books, Scævola is not silent as to his
reason for rejecting the poetic sort of gods,&mdash;to wit, "because
they so disfigure the gods that they could not bear comparison
even with good men, when they make one to commit
theft, another adultery; or, again, to say or do something else
basely and foolishly; as that three goddesses contested (with
each other) the prize of beauty, and the two vanquished by
Venus destroyed Troy; that Jupiter turned himself into a
bull or swan that he might copulate with some one; that a
goddess married a man, and Saturn devoured his children;
that, in fine, there is nothing that could be imagined, either
of the miraculous or vicious, which may not be found there,
and yet is far removed from the nature of the gods." O chief
pontiff Scævola, take away the plays if thou art able; instruct
the people that they may not offer such honours to the immortal
gods, in which, if they like, they may admire the crimes
of the gods, and, so far as it is possible, may, if they please,
imitate them. But if the people shall have answered thee,
You, O pontiff, have brought these things in among us, then
ask the gods themselves at whose instigation you have ordered
these things, that they may not order such things to be offered
to them. For if they are bad, and therefore in no way to be
believed concerning the majority of the gods, the greater is the
wrong done the gods about whom they are feigned with impunity.
But they do not hear thee, they are demons, they
teach wicked things, they rejoice in vile things; not only do
they not count it a wrong if these things are feigned about
them, but it is a wrong they are quite unable to bear if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
are not acted at their stated festivals. But now, if thou
wouldst call on Jupiter against them, chiefly for that reason
that more of his crimes are wont to be acted in the scenic
plays, is it not the case that, although you call him god
Jupiter, by whom this whole world is ruled and administered,
it is he to whom the greatest wrong is done by you, because
you have thought he ought to be worshipped along with them,
and have styled him their king?</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>Whether the worship of the gods has been of service to the Romans in
obtaining and extending the empire.</i></p>

<p>Therefore such gods, who are propitiated by such honours,
or rather are impeached by them (for it is a greater crime to
delight in having such things said of them falsely, than even
if they could be said truly), could never by any means have
been able to increase and preserve the Roman empire. For
if they could have done it, they would rather have bestowed
so grand a gift on the Greeks, who, in this kind of divine
things,&mdash;that is, in scenic plays,&mdash;have worshipped them more
honourably and worthily, although they have not exempted
themselves from those slanders of the poets, by whom they
saw the gods torn in pieces, giving them licence to ill-use
any man they pleased, and have not deemed the scenic
players themselves to be base, but have held them worthy
even of distinguished honour. But just as the Romans were
able to have gold money, although they did not worship a
god Aurinus, so also they could have silver and brass coin,
and yet worship neither Argentinus nor his father Æsculanus;
and so of all the rest, which it would be irksome for me to
detail. It follows, therefore, both that they could not by any
means attain such dominion if the true God was unwilling;
and that if these gods, false and many, were unknown or contemned,
and He alone was known and worshipped with sincere
faith and virtue, they would both have a better kingdom here,
whatever might be its extent, and whether they might have
one here or not, would afterwards receive an eternal kingdom.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the falsity of the augury by which the strength and stability of the
Roman empire was considered to be indicated.</i></p>

<p>For what kind of augury is that which they have declared
to be most beautiful, and to which I referred a little ago, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Mars, and Terminus, and Juventas would not give place even
to Jove the king of the gods? For thus, they say, it was
signified that the nation dedicated to Mars,&mdash;that is, the Roman,&mdash;should
yield to none the place it once occupied; likewise,
that on account of the god Terminus, no one would be able to
disturb the Roman frontiers; and also, that the Roman youth,
because of the goddess Juventas, should yield to no one. Let
them see, therefore, how they can hold him to be the king
of their gods, and the giver of their own kingdom, if these
auguries set him down for an adversary, to whom it would
have been honourable not to yield. However, if these things
are true, they need not be at all afraid. For they are not
going to confess that the gods who would not yield to Jove
have yielded to Christ. For, without altering the boundaries
of the empire, Jesus Christ has proved Himself able to drive
them, not only from their temples, but from the hearts of
their worshippers. But, before Christ came in the flesh, and,
indeed, before these things which we have quoted from their
books could have been written, but yet after that auspice was
made under king Tarquin, the Roman army has been divers
times scattered or put to flight, and has shown the falseness
of the auspice, which they derived from the fact that the goddess
Juventas had not given place to Jove; and the nation
dedicated to Mars was trodden down in the city itself by the
invading and triumphant Gauls; and the boundaries of the
empire, through the falling away of many cities to Hannibal,
had been hemmed into a narrow space. Thus the beauty of
the auspices is made void, and there has remained only the
contumacy against Jove, not of gods, but of demons. For it
is one thing not to have yielded, and another to have returned
whither you have yielded. Besides, even afterwards, in the
oriental regions, the boundaries of the Roman empire were
changed by the will of Hadrian; for he yielded up to the
Persian empire those three noble provinces, Armenia, Mesopotamia,
and Assyria. Thus that god Terminus, who according
to these books was the guardian of the Roman frontiers,
and by that most beautiful auspice had not given place to
Jove, would seem to have been more afraid of Hadrian, a
king of men, than of the king of the gods. The aforesaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
provinces having also been taken back again, almost within
our own recollection the frontier fell back, when Julian, given
up to the oracles of their gods, with immoderate daring ordered
the victualling ships to be set on fire. The army being thus
left destitute of provisions, and he himself also being presently
killed by the enemy, and the legions being hard pressed, while
dismayed by the loss of their commander, they were reduced
to such extremities that no one could have escaped, unless by
articles of peace the boundaries of the empire had then been
established where they still remain; not, indeed, with so great
a loss as was suffered by the concession of Hadrian, but still
at a considerable sacrifice. It was a vain augury, then, that
the god Terminus did not yield to Jove, since he yielded to
the will of Hadrian, and yielded also to the rashness of Julian,
and the necessity of Jovinian. The more intelligent and grave
Romans have seen these things, but have had little power
against the custom of the state, which was bound to observe
the rites of the demons; because even they themselves, although
they perceived that these things were vain, yet thought that
the religious worship which is due to God should be paid to
the nature of things which is established under the rule and
government of the one true God, "serving," as saith the
apostle, "the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed

send holy and truly pious men, who would die for the true
religion that they might remove the false from among the

<p class="center">30. <i>What kind of things even their worshippers have owned they have thought
about the gods of the nations.</i></p>

<p>Cicero the augur laughs at auguries, and reproves men for
regulating the purposes of life by the cries of crows and jackdaws.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
But it will be said that an academic philosopher, who
argues that all things are uncertain, is unworthy to have any
authority in these matters. In the second book of his <i>De
Natura Deorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> he introduces Lucilius Balbus, who, after
showing that superstitions have their origin in physical and
philosophical truths, expresses his indignation at the setting up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of images and fabulous notions, speaking thus: "Do you not
therefore see that from true and useful physical discoveries the
reason may be drawn away to fabulous and imaginary gods?
This gives birth to false opinions and turbulent errors, and
superstitions well-nigh old-wifeish. For both the forms of
the gods, and their ages, and clothing, and ornaments, are
made familiar to us; their genealogies, too, their marriages,
kinships, and all things about them, are debased to the likeness
of human weakness. They are even introduced as having
perturbed minds; for we have accounts of the lusts, cares,
and angers of the gods. Nor, indeed, as the fables go, have
the gods been without their wars and battles. And that not
only when, as in Homer, some gods on either side have defended
two opposing armies, but they have even carried on
wars on their own account, as with the Titans or with the
Giants. Such things it is quite absurd either to say or to
believe: they are utterly frivolous and groundless." Behold,
now, what is confessed by those who defend the gods of the
nations. Afterwards he goes on to say that some things
belong to superstition, but others to religion, which he thinks
good to teach according to the Stoics. "For not only the
philosophers," he says, "but also our forefathers, have made a
distinction between superstition and religion. For those," he
says, "who spent whole days in prayer, and offered sacrifice,
that their children might outlive them, are called superstitious."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
Who does not see that he is trying, while he fears
the public prejudice, to praise the religion of the ancients, and
that he wishes to disjoin it from superstition, but cannot find
out how to do so? For if those who prayed and sacrificed
all day were called superstitious by the ancients, were those
also called so who instituted (what he blames) the images of
the gods of diverse age and distinct clothing, and invented the
genealogies of gods, their marriages, and kinships? When,
therefore, these things are found fault with as superstitious,
he implicates in that fault the ancients who instituted and
worshipped such images. Nay, he implicates himself, who,
with whatever eloquence he may strive to extricate himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and be free, was yet under the necessity of venerating these
images; nor dared he so much as whisper in a discourse to the
people what in this disputation he plainly sounds forth. Let
us Christians, therefore, give thanks to the Lord our God,&mdash;not
to heaven and earth, as that author argues, but to Him who
has made heaven and earth; because these superstitions, which
that Balbus, like a babbler,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> scarcely reprehends, He, by the
most deep lowliness of Christ, by the preaching of the apostles,
by the faith of the martyrs dying for the truth and living
with the truth, has overthrown, not only in the hearts of the
religious, but even in the temples of the superstitious, by their
own free service.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap31"></a>31. <i>Concerning the opinions of Varro, who, while reprobating the popular belief,
thought that their worship should be confined to one god, though he was
unable to discover the true God.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What says Varro himself, whom we grieve to have found,
although not by his own judgment, placing the scenic plays
among things divine? When in many passages he is exhorting,
like a religious man, to the worship of the gods, does he
not in doing so admit that he does not in his own judgment
believe those things which he relates that the Roman state
has instituted; so that he does not hesitate to affirm that if
he were founding a new state, he could enumerate the gods
and their names better by the rule of nature? But being
born into a nation already ancient, he says that he finds himself
bound to accept the traditional names and surnames of
the gods, and the histories connected with them, and that his
purpose in investigating and publishing these details is to incline
the people to worship the gods, and not to despise them.
By which words this most acute man sufficiently indicates
that he does not publish all things, because they would not
only have been contemptible to himself, but would have
seemed despicable even to the rabble, unless they had been
passed over in silence. I should be thought to conjecture
these things, unless he himself, in another passage, had openly
said, in speaking of religious rites, that many things are true
which it is not only not useful for the common people to
know, but that it is expedient that the people should think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
otherwise, even though falsely, and therefore the Greeks have
shut up the religious ceremonies and mysteries in silence,
and within walls. In this he no doubt expresses the policy
of the so-called wise men by whom states and peoples are
ruled. Yet by this crafty device the malign demons are
wonderfully delighted, who possess alike the deceivers and the
deceived, and from whose tyranny nothing sets free save the
grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>The same most acute and learned author also says, that
those alone seem to him to have perceived what God is, who
have believed Him to be the soul of the world, governing it
by design and reason.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> And by this, it appears, that although
he did not attain to the truth,&mdash;for the true God is not a
soul, but the maker and author of the soul,&mdash;yet if he could
have been free to go against the prejudices of custom, he could
have confessed and counselled others that the one God ought
to be worshipped, who governs the world by design and
reason; so that on this subject only this point would remain
to be debated with him, that he had called Him a soul, and
not rather the creator of the soul. He says, also, that the
ancient Romans, for more than a hundred and seventy years,
worshipped the gods without an image.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> "And if this
custom," he says, "could have remained till now, the gods
would have been more purely worshipped." In favour of
this opinion, he cites as a witness among others the Jewish
nation; nor does he hesitate to conclude that passage by
saying of those who first consecrated images for the people,
that they have both taken away religious fear from their
fellow-citizens, and increased error, wisely thinking that the
gods easily fall into contempt when exhibited under the
stolidity of images. But as he does not say they have
transmitted error, but that they have increased it, he therefore
wishes it to be understood that there was error already
when there were no images. Wherefore, when he says they
alone have perceived what God is who have believed Him to
be the governing soul of the world, and thinks that the rites
of religion would have been more purely observed without
images, who fails to see how near he has come to the truth?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
For if he had been able to do anything against so inveterate
an error, he would certainly have given it as his opinion both
that the one God should be worshipped, and that He should
be worshipped without an image; and having so nearly discovered
the truth, perhaps he might easily have been put in
mind of the mutability of the soul, and might thus have perceived
that the true God is that immutable nature which
made the soul itself. Since these things are so, whatever
ridicule such men have poured in their writings against the
plurality of the gods, they have done so rather as compelled
by the secret will of God to confess them, than as trying to
persuade others. If, therefore, any testimonies are adduced
by us from these writings, they are adduced for the confutation
of those who are unwilling to consider from how great
and malignant a power of the demons the singular sacrifice
of the shedding of the most holy blood, and the gift of the
imparted Spirit, can set us free.</p>


<p class="center">32. <i>In what interest the princes of the nations wished false religions to continue
among the people subject to them.</i></p>

<p>Varro says also, concerning the generations of the gods, that
the people have inclined to the poets rather than to the
natural philosophers; and that therefore their forefathers,&mdash;that
is, the ancient Romans,&mdash;believed both in the sex and
the generations of the gods, and settled their marriages;
which certainly seems to have been done for no other cause
except that it was the business of such men as were prudent
and wise to deceive the people in matters of religion, and in
that very thing not only to worship, but also to imitate the
demons, whose greatest lust is to deceive. For just as the
demons cannot possess any but those whom they have deceived
with guile, so also men in princely office, not indeed
being just, but like demons, have persuaded the people in the
name of religion to receive as true those things which they
themselves knew to be false; in this way, as it were, binding
them up more firmly in civil society, so that they might in
like manner possess them as subjects. But who that was
weak and unlearned could escape the deceits of both the
princes of the state and the demons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">33. <i>That the times of all kings and kingdoms are ordained by the judgment
and power of the true God.</i></p>

<p>Therefore that God, the author and giver of felicity, because
He alone is the true God, Himself gives earthly kingdoms both
to good and bad. Neither does He do this rashly, and, as it were,
fortuitously,&mdash;because He is God, not fortune,&mdash;but according
to the order of things and times, which is hidden from us,
but thoroughly known to Himself; which same order of times,
however, He does not serve as subject to it, but Himself rules
as lord and appoints as governor. Felicity He gives only to
the good. Whether a man be a subject or a king makes no
difference: he may equally either possess or not possess it.
And it shall be full in that life where kings and subjects
exist no longer. And therefore earthly kingdoms are given
by Him both to the good and the bad; lest His worshippers,
still under the conduct of a very weak mind, should covet
these gifts from Him as some great things. And this is the
mystery of the Old Testament, in which the New was hidden,
that there even earthly gifts are promised: those who were
spiritual understanding even then, although not yet openly
declaring, both the eternity which was symbolized by these
earthly things, and in what gifts of God true felicity could be
found.</p>


<p class="center">34. <i>Concerning the kingdom of the Jews, which was founded by the one and true
God, and preserved by Him as long as they remained in the true religion.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, that it might be known that these earthly good
things, after which those pant who cannot imagine better
things, remain in the power of the one God Himself, not of
the many false gods whom the Romans have formerly believed
worthy of worship, He multiplied His people in Egypt
from being very few, and delivered them out of it by wonderful
signs. Nor did their women invoke Lucina when their
offspring was being incredibly multiplied; and that nation
having increased incredibly, He Himself delivered, He Himself
saved them from the hands of the Egyptians, who persecuted
them, and wished to kill all their infants. Without the
goddess Rumina they sucked; without Cunina they were cradled;
without Educa and Potina they took food and drink; without
all those puerile gods they were educated; without the nuptial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
gods they were married; without the worship of Priapus they
had conjugal intercourse; without invocation of Neptune the
divided sea opened up a way for them to pass over, and overwhelmed
with its returning waves their enemies who pursued
them. Neither did they consecrate any goddess Mannia when
they received manna from heaven; nor, when the smitten rock
poured forth water to them when they thirsted, did they
worship Nymphs and Lymphs. Without the mad rites of
Mars and Bellona they carried on war; and while, indeed,
they did not conquer without victory, yet they did not hold it
to be a goddess, but the gift of their God. Without Segetia
they had harvests; without Bubona, oxen; honey without
Mellona; apples without Pomona: and, in a word, everything
for which the Romans thought they must supplicate so great
a crowd of false gods, they received much more happily from
the one true God. And if they had not sinned against Him
with impious curiosity, which seduced them like magic arts,
and drew them to strange gods and idols, and at last led them
to kill Christ, their kingdom would have remained to them,
and would have been, if not more spacious, yet more happy,
than that of Rome. And now that they are dispersed through
almost all lands and nations, it is through the providence of
that one true God; that whereas the images, altars, groves,
and temples of the false gods are everywhere overthrown, and
their sacrifices prohibited, it may be shown from their books
how this has been foretold by their prophets so long before;
lest, perhaps, when they should be read in ours, they might
seem to be invented by us. But now, reserving what is to
follow for the following book, we must here set a bound to
the prolixity of this one.</p>

<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>Since, then, it is established that the complete attainment
of all we desire is that which constitutes felicity, which
is no goddess, but a gift of God, and that therefore men
can worship no god save Him who is able to make them
happy,&mdash;and were Felicity herself a goddess, she would with
reason be the only object of worship,&mdash;since, I say, this is
established, let us now go on to consider why God, who is able
to give with all other things those good gifts which can be
possessed by men who are not good, and consequently not
happy, has seen fit to grant such extended and long-continued
dominion to the Roman empire; for that this was not effected
by that multitude of false gods which they worshipped, we
have both already adduced, and shall, as occasion offers, yet
adduce considerable proof.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>That the cause of the Roman empire, and of all kingdoms, is neither fortuitous
nor consists in the position of the stars.</i><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The cause, then, of the greatness of the Roman empire is
neither fortuitous nor fatal, according to the judgment or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
opinion of those who call those things <i>fortuitous</i> which either
have no causes, or such causes as do not proceed from some
intelligible order, and those things <i>fatal</i> which happen independently
of the will of God and man, by the necessity of a
certain <i>order</i>. In a word, human kingdoms are established by
divine providence. And if any one attributes their existence to
fate, because he calls the will or the power of God itself by the
name of fate, let him keep his opinion, but correct his language.
For why does he not say at first what he will say afterwards,
when some one shall put the question to him, What he means
by <i>fate</i>? For when men hear that word, according to the
ordinary use of the language, they simply understand by it
the virtue of that particular position of the stars which may
exist at the time when any one is born or conceived, which
some separate altogether from the will of God, whilst others
affirm that this also is dependent on that will. But those who
are of opinion that, apart from the will of God, the stars determine
what we shall do, or what good things we shall possess,
or what evils we shall suffer, must be refused a hearing by all,
not only by those who hold the true religion, but by those who
wish to be the worshippers of any gods whatsoever, even false
gods. For what does this opinion really amount to but this,
that no god whatever is to be worshipped or prayed to?
Against these, however, our present disputation is not intended
to be directed, but against those who, in defence of those whom
they think to be gods, oppose the Christian religion. They,
however, who make the position of the stars depend on the
divine will, and in a manner decree what character each man
shall have, and what good or evil shall happen to him, if
they think that these same stars have that power conferred
upon them by the supreme power of God, in order that they
may determine these things according to their will, do a great
injury to the celestial sphere, in whose most brilliant senate,
and most splendid senate-house, as it were, they suppose that
wicked deeds are decreed to be done,&mdash;such deeds as that if any
terrestrial state should decree them, it would be condemned to
overthrow by the decree of the whole human race. What
judgment, then, is left to God concerning the deeds of men,
who is Lord both of the stars and of men, when to these deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
a celestial necessity is attributed? Or, if they do not say that
the stars, though they have indeed received a certain power from
God, who is supreme, determine those things according to their
own discretion, but simply that His commands are fulfilled by
them instrumentally in the application and enforcing of such
necessities, are we thus to think concerning God even what
it seemed unworthy that we should think concerning the will
of the stars? But, if the stars are said rather to signify these
things than to effect them, so that that <i>position of the stars</i> is,
as it were, a kind of speech predicting, not causing future things,&mdash;for
this has been the opinion of men of no ordinary learning,&mdash;certainly
the mathematicians are not wont so to speak, saying,
for example, Mars in such or such a position <i>signifies</i> a homicide,
but <i>makes</i> a homicide. But, nevertheless, though we
grant that they do not speak as they ought, and that we ought
to accept as the proper form of speech that employed by the
philosophers in predicting those things which they think they
discover in the position of the stars, how comes it that they
have never been able to assign any cause why, in the life of
twins, in their actions, in the events which befall them, in
their professions, arts, honours, and other things pertaining to
human life, also in their very death, there is often so great a
difference, that, as far as these things are concerned, many
entire strangers are more like them than they are like each
other, though separated at birth by the smallest interval of
time, but at conception generated by the same act of copulation,
and at the same moment?</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>On the difference in the health of twins.</i></p>

<p>Cicero says that the famous physician Hippocrates has left
in writing that he had suspected that a certain pair of brothers
were twins, from the fact that they both took ill at once, and
their disease advanced to its crisis and subsided in the same
time in each of them.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Posidonius the Stoic, who was much
given to astrology, used to explain the fact by supposing that
they had been born and conceived under the same constellation.
In this question the conjecture of the physician is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
far more worthy to be accepted, and approaches much nearer
to credibility, since, according as the parents were affected in
body at the time of copulation, so might the first elements of
the f&#339;tuses have been affected, so that all that was necessary
for their growth and development up till birth having been
supplied from the body of the same mother, they might be
born with like constitutions. Thereafter, nourished in the
same house, on the same kinds of food, where they would have
also the same kinds of air, the same locality, the same quality
of water,&mdash;which, according to the testimony of medical science,
have a very great influence, good or bad, on the condition of
bodily health,&mdash;and where they would also be accustomed to
the same kinds of exercise, they would have bodily constitutions
so similar that they would be similarly affected with sickness
at the same time and by the same causes. But, to wish
to adduce that particular position of the stars which existed
at the time when they were born or conceived as the cause of
their being simultaneously affected with sickness, manifests the
greatest arrogance, when so many beings of most diverse kinds,
in the most diverse conditions, and subject to the most diverse
events, may have been conceived and born at the same time,
and in the same district, lying under the same sky. But we
know that twins do not only act differently, and travel to very
different places, but that they also suffer from different kinds
of sickness; for which Hippocrates would give what is in my
opinion the simplest reason, namely, that, through diversity
of food and exercise, which arises not from the constitution of
the body, but from the inclination of the mind, they may have
come to be different from each other in respect of health.
Moreover, Posidonius, or any other asserter of the fatal influence
of the stars, will have enough to do to find anything
to say to this, if he be unwilling to impose upon the minds of
the uninstructed in things of which they are ignorant. But,
as to what they attempt to make out from that very small
interval of time elapsing between the births of twins, on account
of that point in the heavens where the mark of the
natal hour is placed, and which they call the "horoscope," it
is either disproportionately small to the diversity which is
found in the dispositions, actions, habits, and fortunes of twins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
or it is disproportionately great when compared with the estate
of twins, whether low or high, which is the same for both of
them, the cause for whose greatest difference they place, in
every case, in the hour on which one is born; and, for this
reason, if the one is born so immediately after the other that
there is no change in the horoscope, I demand an entire similarity
in all that respects them both, which can never be found
in the case of any twins. But if the slowness of the birth of
the second give time for a change in the horoscope, I demand
different parents, which twins can never have.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Concerning the arguments which Nigidius the mathematician drew from
the potter's wheel, in the question about the birth of twins.</i></p>

<p>It is to no purpose, therefore, that that famous fiction about
the potter's wheel is brought forward, which tells of the answer
which Nigidius is said to have given when he was perplexed
with this question, and on account of which he was called
<i>Figulus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> For, having whirled round the potter's wheel with
all his strength, he marked it with ink, striking it twice with
the utmost rapidity, so that the strokes seemed to fall on the
very same part of it. Then, when the rotation had ceased,
the marks which he had made were found upon the rim of the
wheel at no small distance apart. Thus, said he, considering
the great rapidity with which the celestial sphere revolves,
even though twins were born with as short an interval between
their births as there was between the strokes which I gave this
wheel, that brief interval of time is equivalent to a very great
distance in the celestial sphere. Hence, said he, come whatever
dissimilitudes may be remarked in the habits and fortunes
of twins. This argument is more fragile than the vessels
which are fashioned by the rotation of that wheel. For if
there is so much significance in the heavens which cannot be
comprehended by observation of the constellations, that, in the
case of twins, an inheritance may fall to the one and not to
the other, why, in the case of others who are not twins, do
they dare, having examined their constellations, to declare such
things as pertain to that secret which no one can comprehend,
and to attribute them to the precise moment of the birth of each
individual? Now, if such predictions in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
natal hours of others who are not twins are to be vindicated on
the ground that they are founded on the observation of more extended
spaces in the heavens, whilst those very small moments
of time which separated the births of twins, and correspond
to minute portions of celestial space, are to be connected with
trifling things about which the mathematicians are not wont
to be consulted,&mdash;for who would consult them as to when he is
to sit, when to walk abroad, when and on what he is to dine?&mdash;how
can we be justified in so speaking, when we can point
out such manifold diversity both in the habits, doings, and
destinies of twins?</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Concerning the twins Esau and Jacob, who were very unlike each other
both in their character and actions.</i></p>

<p>In the time of the ancient fathers, to speak concerning
illustrious persons, there were born two twin brothers, the
one so immediately after the other, that the first took hold of
the heel of the second. So great a difference existed in their
lives and manners, so great a dissimilarity in their actions, so
great a difference in their parents' love for them respectively,
that the very contrast between them produced even a mutual
hostile antipathy. Do we mean, when we say that they were
so unlike each other, that when the one was walking the other
was sitting, when the one was sleeping the other was waking,&mdash;which
differences are such as are attributed to those minute
portions of space which cannot be appreciated by those who
note down the position of the stars which exists at the moment
of one's birth, in order that the mathematicians may be consulted
concerning it? One of these twins was for a long time
a hired servant; the other never served. One of them was
beloved by his mother; the other was not so. One of them
lost that honour which was so much valued among their
people; the other obtained it. And what shall we say of
their wives, their children, and their possessions? How different
they were in respect to all these! If, therefore, such
things as these are connected with those minute intervals of
time which elapse between the births of twins, and are not to
be attributed to the constellations, wherefore are they predicted
in the case of others from the examination of their constellations?
And if, on the other hand, these things are said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
predicted, because they are connected, not with minute and
inappreciable moments, but with intervals of time which can be
observed and noted down, what purpose is that potter's wheel
to serve in this matter, except it be to whirl round men who
have hearts of clay, in order that they may be prevented from
detecting the emptiness of the talk of the mathematicians?</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>In what manner the mathematicians are convicted of professing a vain science.</i></p>

<p>Do not those very persons whom the medical sagacity of
Hippocrates led him to suspect to be twins, because their
disease was observed by him to develope to its crisis and to
subside again in the same time in each of them,&mdash;do not these,
I say, serve as a sufficient refutation of those who wish to
attribute to the influence of the stars that which was owing
to a similarity of bodily constitution? For wherefore were
they both sick of the same disease, and at the same time, and
not the one after the other in the order of their birth? (for
certainly they could not both be born at the same time.) Or,
if the fact of their having been born at different times by no
means necessarily implies that they must be sick at different
times, why do they contend that the difference in the time of
their births was the cause of their difference in other things?
Why could they travel in foreign parts at different times,
marry at different times, beget children at different times, and
do many other things at different times, by reason of their
having been born at different times, and yet could not, for
the same reason, also be sick at different times? For if a
difference in the moment of birth changed the horoscope, and
occasioned dissimilarity in all other things, why has that
simultaneousness which belonged to their conception remained
in their attacks of sickness? Or, if the destinies of health
are involved in the time of conception, but those of other
things be said to be attached to the time of birth, they ought
not to predict anything concerning health from examination
of the constellations of birth, when the hour of conception is
not also given, that its constellations may be inspected. But
if they say that they predict attacks of sickness without examining
the horoscope of conception, because these are indicated
by the moments of birth, how could they inform either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of these twins when he would be sick, from the horoscope of
his birth, when the other also, who had not the same horoscope
of birth, must of necessity fall sick at the same time? Again,
I ask, if the distance of time between the births of twins is
so great as to occasion a difference of their constellations on
account of the difference of their horoscopes, and therefore of
all the cardinal points to which so much influence is attributed,
that even from such change there comes a difference of destiny,
how is it possible that this should be so, since they cannot
have been conceived at different times? Or, if two conceived
at the same moment of time could have different destinies
with respect to their births, why may not also two born at
the same moment of time have different destinies for life and
for death? For if the one moment in which both were conceived
did not hinder that the one should be born before the
other, why, if two are born at the same moment, should anything
hinder them from dying at the same moment? If a
simultaneous conception allows of twins being differently
affected in the <i>womb</i>, why should not simultaneousness of
birth allow of any two individuals having different fortunes
in the <i>world</i>? and thus would all the fictions of this art, or
rather delusion, be swept away. What strange circumstance
is this, that two children conceived at the same time, nay, at
the same moment, under the same position of the stars, have
different fates which bring them to different hours of birth,
whilst two children, born of two different mothers, at the same
moment of time, under one and the same position of the stars,
cannot have different fates which shall conduct them by necessity
to diverse manners of life and of death? Are they at
conception as yet without destinies, because they can only
have them if they be born? What, therefore, do they mean
when they say that, if the hour of the conception be found,
many things can be predicted by these astrologers? from
which also arose that story which is reiterated by some, that
a certain sage chose an hour in which to lie with his wife, in
order to secure his begetting an illustrious son. From this
opinion also came that answer of Posidonius, the great astrologer
and also philosopher, concerning those twins who were
attacked with sickness at the same time, namely, "That this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
had happened to them because they were conceived at the
same time, and born at the same time." For certainly he
added "conception," lest it should be said to him that they
could not both be <i>born</i> at the same time, knowing that at any
rate they must both have been conceived at the same time;
wishing thus to show that he did not attribute the fact of
their being similarly and simultaneously affected with sickness
to the similarity of their bodily constitutions as its proximate
cause, but that he held that even in respect of the similarity
of their health, they were bound together by a sidereal connection.
If, therefore, the time of conception has so much to
do with the similarity of destinies, these same destinies ought
not to be changed by the circumstances of birth; or, if the
destinies of twins be said to be changed because they are
born at different times, why should we not rather understand
that they had been already changed in order that they might
be born at different times? Does not, then, the will of men
living in the world change the destinies of birth, when the
order of birth can change the destinies they had at conception?</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Concerning twins of different sexes.</i></p>

<p>But even in the very conception of twins, which certainly
occurs at the same moment in the case of both, it often happens
that the one is conceived a male, and the other a female.
I know two of different sexes who are twins. Both of them
are alive, and in the flower of their age; and though they
resemble each other in body, as far as difference of sex will
permit, still they are very different in the whole scope and
purpose of their lives (consideration being had of those differences
which necessarily exist between the lives of males and
females),&mdash;the one holding the office of a count, and being
almost constantly away from home with the army in foreign
service, the other never leaving her country's soil, or her
native district. Still more,&mdash;and this is more incredible, if the
destinies of the stars are to be believed in, though it is not
wonderful if we consider the wills of men, and the free gifts
of God,&mdash;he is married; she is a sacred virgin: he has begotten
a numerous offspring; she has never even married. But is
not the virtue of the horoscope very great? I think I have
said enough to show the absurdity of that. But, say those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
astrologers, whatever be the virtue of the horoscope in other
respects, it is certainly of significance with respect to birth.
But why not also with respect to conception, which takes
place undoubtedly with one act of copulation? And, indeed,
so great is the force of nature, that after a woman has once
conceived, she ceases to be liable to conception. Or were
they, perhaps, changed at birth, either he into a male, or she
into a female, because of the difference in their horoscopes?
But, whilst it is not altogether absurd to say that certain
sidereal influences have some power to cause differences in
bodies alone,&mdash;as, for instance, we see that the seasons of the
year come round by the approaching and receding of the sun,
and that certain kinds of things are increased in size or
diminished by the waxings and wanings of the moon, such
as sea-urchins, oysters, and the wonderful tides of the ocean,&mdash;it
does not follow that the <i>wills of men</i> are to be made subject
to the position of the stars. The astrologers, however, when
they wish to bind our actions also to the constellations, only
set us on investigating whether, even in these bodies, the
changes may not be attributable to some other than a sidereal
cause. For what is there which more intimately concerns a
body than its sex? And yet, under the same position of the
stars, twins of different sexes may be conceived. Wherefore,
what greater absurdity can be affirmed or believed than that
the position of the stars, which was the same for both of them
at the time of conception, could not cause that the one child
should not have been of a different sex from her brother, with
whom she had a common constellation, whilst the position of
the stars which existed at the hour of their birth could cause
that she should be separated from him by the great distance
between marriage and holy virginity?</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Concerning the choosing of a day for marriage, or for planting, or sowing.</i></p>

<p>Now, will any one bring forward this, that in choosing
certain particular days for particular actions, men bring about
certain new destinies for their actions? That man, for instance,
according to this doctrine, was not born to have an illustrious
son, but rather a contemptible one, and therefore, being a man
of learning, he chose an hour in which to lie with his wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
He made, therefore, a destiny which he did not have before,
and from that destiny of his own making something began to
be fatal which was not contained in the destiny of his natal
hour. Oh, singular stupidity! A day is chosen on which to
marry; and for this reason, I believe, that unless a day be
chosen, the marriage may fall on an unlucky day, and turn
out an unhappy one. What then becomes of what the stars
have already decreed at the hour of birth? Can a man be
said to change by an act of choice that which has already
been determined for him, whilst that which he himself has
determined in the choosing of a day cannot be changed by
another power? Thus, if men alone, and not all things under
heaven, are subject to the influence of the stars, why do they
choose some days as suitable for planting vines or trees, or for
sowing grain, other days as suitable for taming beasts on, or
for putting the males to the females, that the cows and mares
may be impregnated, and for such-like things? If it be said
that certain chosen days have an influence on these things,
because the constellations rule over all terrestrial bodies,
animate and inanimate, according to differences in moments
of time, let it be considered what innumerable multitudes of
beings are born or arise, or take their origin at the very same
instant of time, which come to ends so different, that they
may persuade any little boy that these observations about
days are ridiculous. For who is so mad as to dare affirm
that all trees, all herbs, all beasts, serpents, birds, fishes,
worms, have each separately their own moments of birth or
commencement? Nevertheless, men are wont, in order to
try the skill of the mathematicians, to bring before them the
constellations of dumb animals, the constellations of whose
birth they diligently observe at home with a view to this
discovery; and they prefer those mathematicians to all others,
who say from the inspection of the constellations that they
indicate the birth of a beast and not of a man. They also
dare tell what kind of beast it is, whether it is a wool-bearing
beast, or a beast suited for carrying burthens, or one fit for
the plough, or for watching a house; for the astrologers are
also tried with respect to the fates of dogs, and their answers
concerning these are followed by shouts of admiration on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
part of those who consult them. They so deceive men as to
make them think that during the birth of a man the births
of all other beings are suspended, so that not even a fly comes
to life at the same time that he is being born, under the same
region of the heavens. And if this be admitted with respect
to the fly, the reasoning cannot stop there, but must ascend
from flies till it lead them up to camels and elephants. Nor
are they willing to attend to this, that when a day has been
chosen whereon to sow a field, so many grains fall into the
ground simultaneously, germinate simultaneously, spring up,
come to perfection, and ripen simultaneously; and yet, of all
the ears which are coeval, and, so to speak, <i>congerminal</i>, some
are destroyed by mildew, some are devoured by the birds, and
some are pulled by men. How can they say that all these
had their different constellations, which they see coming to so
different ends? Will they confess that it is folly to choose
days for such things, and to affirm that they do not come
within the sphere of the celestial decree, whilst they subject
men alone to the stars, on whom alone in the world God has
bestowed free wills? All these things being considered, we
have good reason to believe that, when the astrologers give
very many wonderful answers, it is to be attributed to the
occult inspiration of spirits not of the best kind, whose care
it is to insinuate into the minds of men, and to confirm in
them, those false and noxious opinions concerning the fatal
influence of the stars, and not to their marking and inspecting
of horoscopes, according to some kind of art which in reality
has no existence.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Concerning those who call by the name of fate, not the position of the stars,
but the connection of causes which depends on the will of God.</i></p>

<p>But, as to those who call by the name of fate, not the disposition
of the stars as it may exist when any creature is
conceived, or born, or commences its existence, but the whole
connection and train of causes which makes everything become
what it does become, there is no need that I should labour
and strive with them in a merely verbal controversy, since
they attribute the so-called order and connection of causes to
the will and power of God most high, who is most rightly
and most truly believed to know all things before they come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to pass, and to leave nothing unordained; from whom are all
powers, although the wills of all are not from Him. Now,
that it is chiefly the will of God most high, whose power
extends itself irresistibly through all things which they call
fate, is proved by the following verses, of which, if I mistake
not, Annæus Seneca is the author:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Father supreme, Thou ruler of the lofty heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lead me where'er it is Thy pleasure; I will give<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A prompt obedience, making no delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lo! here I am. Promptly I come to do Thy sovereign will;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If Thy command shall thwart my inclination, I will still<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Follow Thee groaning, and the work assigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With all the suffering of a mind repugnant,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will perform, being evil; which, had I been good,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I should have undertaken and performed, though hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With virtuous cheerfulness.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Fates do lead the man that follows willing;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the man that is unwilling, him they drag."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Most evidently, in this last verse, he calls that "fate" which
he had before called "the will of the Father supreme," whom,
he says, he is ready to obey that he may be led, being willing,
not dragged, being unwilling, since "the Fates do lead the
man that follows willing, but the man that is unwilling, him
they drag."</p>

<p>The following Homeric lines, which Cicero translates into
Latin, also favour this opinion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such are the minds of men, as is the light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which Father Jove himself doth pour<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Illustrious o'er the fruitful earth."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Not that Cicero wishes that a poetical sentiment should
have any weight in a question like this; for when he says
that the Stoics, when asserting the power of fate, were in the
habit of using these verses from Homer, he is not treating
concerning the opinion of that poet, but concerning that of
those philosophers, since by these verses, which they quote in
connection with the controversy which they hold about fate,
is most distinctly manifested what it is which they reckon
fate, since they call by the name of Jupiter him whom they
reckon the supreme god, from whom, they say, hangs the
whole chain of fates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">9. <i>Concerning the foreknowledge of God and the free will of man, in opposition
to the definition of Cicero.</i></p>

<p>The manner in which Cicero addresses himself to the task
of refuting the Stoics, shows that he did not think he could
effect anything against them in argument unless he had first
demolished divination.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> And this he attempts to accomplish
by denying that there is any knowledge of future things,
and maintains with all his might that there is no such knowledge
either in God or man, and that there is no prediction
of events. Thus he both denies the foreknowledge of God,
and attempts by vain arguments, and by opposing to himself
certain oracles very easy to be refuted, to overthrow all prophecy,
even such as is clearer than the light (though even
these oracles are not refuted by him).</p>

<p>But, in refuting these conjectures of the mathematicians, his
argument is triumphant, because truly these are such as destroy
and refute themselves. Nevertheless, they are far more tolerable
who assert the fatal influence of the stars than they who
deny the foreknowledge of future events. For, to confess that
God exists, and at the same time to deny that He has foreknowledge
of future things, is the most manifest folly. This
Cicero himself saw, and therefore attempted to assert the
doctrine embodied in the words of Scripture, "The fool hath
said in his heart, There is no God."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> That, however, he did
not do in his own person, for he saw how odious and offensive
such an opinion would be; and, therefore in his book on the
nature of the gods,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> he makes Cotta dispute concerning this
against the Stoics, and preferred to give his own opinion in
favour of Lucilius Balbus, to whom he assigned the defence of
the Stoical position, rather than in favour of Cotta, who maintained
that no divinity exists. However, in his book on
divination, he in his own person most openly opposes the
doctrine of the prescience of future things. But all this he
seems to do in order that he may not grant the doctrine of
fate, and by so doing destroy free will. For he thinks that,
the knowledge of future things being once conceded, fate follows
as so necessary a consequence that it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>But, let these perplexing debatings and disputations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
philosophers go on as they may, we, in order that we may
confess the most high and true God Himself, do confess His
will, supreme power, and prescience. Neither let us be afraid
lest, after all, we do not do by will that which we do by will,
because He, whose foreknowledge is infallible, foreknew that
we would do it. It was this which Cicero was afraid of, and
therefore opposed foreknowledge. The Stoics also maintained
that all things do not come to pass by necessity, although
they contended that all things happen according to destiny.
What is it, then, that Cicero feared in the prescience of future
things? Doubtless it was this,&mdash;that if all future things
have been foreknown, they will happen in the order in which
they have been foreknown; and if they come to pass in this
order, there is a certain order of things foreknown by God;
and if a certain order of things, then a certain order of causes,
for nothing can happen which is not preceded by some efficient
cause. But if there is a certain order of causes according to
which everything happens which does happen, then by fate,
says he, all things happen which do happen. But if this be
so, then is there nothing in our own power, and there is no
such thing as freedom of will; and if we grant that, says he,
the whole economy of human life is subverted. In vain are
laws enacted. In vain are reproaches, praises, chidings, exhortations
had recourse to; and there is no justice whatever
in the appointment of rewards for the good, and punishments
for the wicked. And that consequences so disgraceful, and
absurd, and pernicious to humanity may not follow, Cicero
chooses to reject the foreknowledge of future things, and shuts
up the religious mind to this alternative, to make choice between
two things, either that something is in our own power,
or that there is foreknowledge,&mdash;both of which cannot be true;
but if the one is affirmed, the other is thereby denied. He
therefore, like a truly great and wise man, and one who consulted
very much and very skilfully for the good of humanity,
of those two chose the freedom of the will, to confirm which
he denied the foreknowledge of future things; and thus, wishing
to make men free, he makes them sacrilegious. But the
religious mind chooses both, confesses both, and maintains
both by the faith of piety. But how so? says Cicero; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
knowledge of future things being granted, there follows a chain
of consequences which ends in this, that there can be nothing
depending on our own free wills. And further, if there is
anything depending on our wills, we must go backwards by
the same steps of reasoning till we arrive at the conclusion
that there is no foreknowledge of future things. For we go
backwards through all the steps in the following order:&mdash;If
there is free will, all things do not happen according to
fate; if all things do not happen according to fate, there is
not a certain order of causes; and if there is not a certain
order of causes, neither is there a certain order of things foreknown
by God,&mdash;for things cannot come to pass except they
are preceded by efficient causes,&mdash;but, if there is no fixed and
certain order of causes foreknown by God, all things cannot
be said to happen according as He foreknew that they would
happen. And further, if it is not true that all things happen
just as they have been foreknown by Him, there is not, says
he, in God any foreknowledge of future events.</p>

<p>Now, against the sacrilegious and impious darings of
reason, we assert both that God knows all things before
they come to pass, and that we do by our free will whatsoever
we know and feel to be done by us only because
we will it. But that all things come to pass by fate, we
do not say; nay we affirm that nothing comes to pass by
fate; for we demonstrate that the name of fate, as it is wont
to be used by those who speak of fate, meaning thereby the
position of the stars at the time of each one's conception
or birth, is an unmeaning word, for astrology itself is a delusion.
But an order of causes in which the highest efficiency
is attributed to the will of God, we neither deny nor do we
designate it by the name of fate, unless, perhaps, we may
understand fate to mean that which is spoken, deriving it from
<i>fari</i>, to speak; for we cannot deny that it is written in the
sacred Scriptures, "God hath spoken once; these two things
have I heard, that power belongeth unto God. Also unto
Thee, O God, belongeth mercy: for Thou wilt render unto
every man according to his works."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Now the expression,
"Once hath He spoken," is to be understood as meaning "<i>immovably</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>"
that is, unchangeably hath He spoken, inasmuch as
He knows unchangeably all things which shall be, and all
things which He will do. We might, then, use the word fate
in the sense it bears when derived from <i>fari</i>, to speak, had it
not already come to be understood in another sense, into which
I am unwilling that the hearts of men should unconsciously
slide. But it does not follow that, though there is for God a
certain order of all causes, there must therefore be nothing
depending on the free exercise of our own wills, for our wills
themselves are included in that order of causes which is certain
to God, and is embraced by His foreknowledge, for human
wills are also causes of human actions; and He who foreknew
all the causes of things would certainly among those causes
not have been ignorant of our wills. For even that very concession
which Cicero himself makes is enough to refute him
in this argument. For what does it help him to say that
nothing takes place without a cause, but that every cause is
not fatal, there being a fortuitous cause, a natural cause, and
a voluntary cause? It is sufficient that he confesses that
whatever happens must be preceded by a cause. For we say
that those causes which are called fortuitous are not a mere
name for the absence of causes, but are only latent, and we
attribute them either to the will of the true God, or to that of
spirits of some kind or other. And as to natural causes, we by
no means separate them from the will of Him who is the author
and framer of all nature. But now as to voluntary causes.
They are referable either to God, or to angels, or to men, or to
animals of whatever description, if indeed those instinctive
movements of animals devoid of reason, by which, in accordance
with their own nature, they seek or shun various things,
are to be called wills. And when I speak of the wills of
angels, I mean either the wills of good angels, whom we call
the angels of God, or of the wicked angels, whom we call the
angels of the devil, or demons. Also by the wills of men I
mean the wills either of the good or of the wicked. And from
this we conclude that there are no efficient causes of all things
which come to pass unless voluntary causes, that is, such as
belong to that nature which is the spirit of life. For the air
or wind is called spirit, but, inasmuch as it is a body, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the spirit of life. The spirit of life, therefore, which quickens
all things, and is the creator of every body, and of every
created spirit, is God Himself, the uncreated spirit. In His
supreme will resides the power which acts on the wills of all
created spirits, helping the good, judging the evil, controlling
all, granting power to some, not granting it to others. For,
as He is the creator of all natures, so also is He the bestower
of all powers, not of all wills; for wicked wills are not from
Him, being contrary to nature, which is from Him. As to
bodies, they are more subject to wills: some to our wills, by
which I mean the wills of all living mortal creatures, but
more to the wills of men than of beasts. But all of them are
most of all subject to the will of God, to whom all wills also
are subject, since they have no power except what He has
bestowed upon them. The cause of things, therefore, which
makes but is not made, is God; but all other causes both
make and are made. Such are all created spirits, and especially
the rational. Material causes, therefore, which may rather
be said to be made than to make, are not to be reckoned
among efficient causes, because they can only do what the
wills of spirits do by them. How, then, does an order of
causes which is certain to the foreknowledge of God necessitate
that there should be nothing which is dependent on our wills,
when our wills themselves have a very important place in the
order of causes? Cicero, then, contends with those who call
this order of causes fatal, or rather designate this order itself
by the name of fate; to which we have an abhorrence, especially
on account of the word, which men have become accustomed
to understand as meaning what is not true. But,
whereas he denies that the order of all causes is most certain,
and perfectly clear to the prescience of God, we detest his
opinion more than the Stoics do. For he either denies that
God exists,&mdash;which, indeed, in an assumed personage, he has
laboured to do, in his book <i>De Natura Deorum</i>,&mdash;or if he
confesses that He exists, but denies that He is prescient of
future things, what is that but just "the fool saying in his
heart there is no God?" For one who is not prescient of all
future things is not God. Wherefore our wills also have just
so much power as God willed and foreknew that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
have; and therefore whatever power they have, they have it
within most certain limits; and whatever they are to do, they
are most assuredly to do, for He whose foreknowledge is infallible
foreknew that they would have the power to do it,
and would do it. Wherefore, if I should choose to apply the
name of fate to anything at all, I should rather say that fate
belongs to the weaker of two parties, will to the stronger, who
has the other in his power, than that the freedom of our will
is excluded by that order of causes, which, by an unusual
application of the word peculiar to themselves, the Stoics call
<i>Fate</i>.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Whether our wills are ruled by necessity.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore, neither is that necessity to be feared, for dread
of which the Stoics laboured to make such distinctions among
the causes of things as should enable them to rescue certain
things from the dominion of necessity, and to subject others to
it. Among those things which they wished not to be subject
to necessity they placed our wills, knowing that they would
not be free if subjected to necessity. For if that is to be
called <i>our necessity</i> which is not in our power, but even though
we be unwilling effects what it can effect,&mdash;as, for instance, the
necessity of death,&mdash;it is manifest that our wills by which we
live uprightly or wickedly are not under such a necessity;
for we do many things which, if we were not willing, we should
certainly not do. This is primarily true of the act of willing
itself,&mdash;for if we will, it <i>is</i>; if we will not, it <i>is</i> not,&mdash;for we
should not will if we were unwilling. But if we define necessity
to be that according to which we say that it is necessary
that anything be of such or such a nature, or be done in such and
such a manner, I know not why we should have any dread of
that necessity taking away the freedom of our will. For we
do not put the life of God or the foreknowledge of God under
necessity if we should say that it is necessary that God should
live for ever, and foreknow all things; as neither is His power
diminished when we say that He cannot die or fall into error,&mdash;for
this is in such a way impossible to Him, that if it were
possible for Him, He would be of less power. But assuredly
He is rightly called omnipotent, though He can neither die
nor fall into error. For He is called omnipotent on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering
what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by
no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some
things for the very reason that He is omnipotent. So also,
when we say that it is necessary that, when we will, we will
by free choice, in so saying we both affirm what is true beyond
doubt, and do not still subject our wills thereby to a necessity
which destroys liberty. Our wills, therefore, <i>exist</i> as <i>wills</i>, and
do themselves whatever we do by willing, and which would
not be done if we were unwilling. But when any one suffers
anything, being unwilling, by the will of another, even in that
case will retains its essential validity,&mdash;we do not mean the
will of the party who inflicts the suffering, for we resolve it
into the power of God. For if a will should simply exist, but
not be able to do what it wills, it would be overborne by a
more powerful will. Nor would this be the case unless there
had existed will, and that not the will of the other party, but
the will of him who willed, but was not able to accomplish
what he willed. Therefore, whatsoever a man suffers contrary
to his own will, he ought not to attribute to the will of men,
or of angels, or of any created spirit, but rather to His will
who gives power to wills. It is not the case, therefore, that
because God foreknew what would be in the power of our
wills, there is for that reason nothing in the power of our
wills. For he who foreknew this did not foreknow nothing.
Moreover, if He who foreknew what would be in the power of
our wills did not foreknow nothing, but something, assuredly,
even though He did foreknow, there is something in the power
of our wills. Therefore we are by no means compelled, either,
retaining the prescience of God, to take away the freedom of
the will, or, retaining the freedom of the will, to deny that He
is prescient of future things, which is impious. But we embrace
both. We faithfully and sincerely confess both. The
former, that we may believe well; the latter, that we may live
well. For he lives ill who does not believe well concerning
God. Wherefore, be it far from us, in order to maintain our
freedom, to deny the prescience of Him by whose help we are
or shall be free. Consequently, it is not in vain that laws are
enacted, and that reproaches, exhortations, praises, and vituperations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
are had recourse to; for these also He foreknew, and
they are of great avail, even as great as He foreknew that they
would be of. Prayers, also, are of avail to procure those things
which He foreknew that He would grant to those who offered
them; and with justice have rewards been appointed for good
deeds, and punishments for sins. For a man does not therefore
sin because God foreknew that he would sin. Nay, it
cannot be doubted but that it is the man himself who sins
when he does sin, because He, whose foreknowledge is infallible,
foreknew not that fate, or fortune, or something else
would sin, but that the man himself would sin, who, if he
wills not, sins not. But if he shall not will to sin, even this
did God foreknow.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Concerning the universal providence of God in the laws of which all things

<p>Therefore God supreme and true, with His Word and Holy

maker of every soul and of every body; by whose gift all are
happy who are happy through verity and not through vanity;
who made man a rational animal consisting of soul and body,
who, when he sinned, neither permitted him to go unpunished,
nor left him without mercy; who has given to the good and

common with trees, sensuous life in common with brutes,
intellectual life in common with angels alone; from whom
is every mode, every species, every order; from whom are

has an existence in nature, of whatever kind it be, and of
whatever value; from whom are the seeds of forms and the
forms of seeds, and the motion of seeds and of forms; who
gave also to flesh its origin, beauty, health, reproductive
fecundity, disposition of members, and the salutary concord of
its parts; who also to the irrational soul has given memory,
sense, appetite, but to the rational soul, in addition to these,
has given intelligence and will; who has not left, not to speak
of heaven and earth, angels and men, but not even the entrails
of the smallest and most contemptible animal, or the feather

without an harmony, and, as it were, a mutual peace among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
all its parts;&mdash;that God can never be believed to have left
the kingdoms of men, their dominations and servitudes, outside
of the laws of His providence.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>By what virtues the ancient Romans merited that the true God, although they
did not worship Him, should enlarge their empire.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore let us go on to consider what virtues of the
Romans they were which the true God, in whose power are
also the kingdoms of the earth, condescended to help in
order to raise the empire, and also for what reason He did so.
And, in order to discuss this question on clearer ground, we
have written the former books, to show that the power of
those gods, who, they thought, were to be worshipped with
such trifling and silly rites, had nothing to do in this matter;
and also what we have already accomplished of the present
volume, to refute the doctrine of fate, lest any one who might
have been already persuaded that the Roman empire was not
extended and preserved by the worship of these gods, might
still be attributing its extension and preservation to some kind
of fate, rather than to the most powerful will of God most
high. The ancient and primitive Romans, therefore, though
their history shows us that, like all the other nations, with
the sole exception of the Hebrews, they worshipped false gods,
and sacrificed victims, not to God, but to demons, have nevertheless
this commendation bestowed on them by their historian,
that they were "greedy of praise, prodigal of wealth, desirous
of great glory, and content with a moderate fortune."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Glory
they most ardently loved: for it they wished to live, for it
they did not hesitate to die. Every other desire was repressed
by the strength of their passion for that one thing. At length
their country itself, because it seemed inglorious to serve, but
glorious to rule and to command, they first earnestly desired
to be free, and then to be mistress. Hence it was that, not
enduring the domination of kings, they put the government
into the hands of two chiefs, holding office for a year, who
were called consuls, not kings or lords.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> But royal pomp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
seemed inconsistent with the administration of a ruler (<i>regentis</i>),
or the benevolence of one who consults (that is, for the
public good) (<i>consulentis</i>), but rather with the haughtiness of
a lord (<i>dominantis</i>). King Tarquin, therefore, having been
banished, and the consular government having been instituted,
it followed, as the same author already alluded to says in his
praises of the Romans, that "the state grew with amazing
rapidity after it had obtained liberty, so great a desire of
glory had taken possession of it." That eagerness for praise
and desire of glory, then, was that which accomplished those
many wonderful things, laudable, doubtless, and glorious according
to human judgment. The same Sallust praises the
great men of his own time, Marcus Cato, and Caius Cæsar,
saying that for a long time the republic had no one great in
virtue, but that within his memory there had been these two
men of eminent virtue, and very different pursuits. Now,
among the praises which he pronounces on Cæsar he put
this, that he wished for a great empire, an army, and a new
war, that he might have a sphere where his genius and virtue
might shine forth. Thus it was ever the prayer of men of
heroic character that Bellona would excite miserable nations
to war, and lash them into agitation with her bloody scourge,
so that there might be occasion for the display of their
valour. This, forsooth, is what that desire of praise and
thirst for glory did. Wherefore, by the love of liberty in the
first place, afterwards also by that of domination and through
the desire of praise and glory, they achieved many great things;
and their most eminent poet testifies to their having been
prompted by all these motives:</p>

<span class="i0">"Porsenna there, with pride elate,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>At that time it was their greatest ambition either to die
bravely or to live free; but when liberty was obtained, so
great a desire of glory took possession of them, that liberty
alone was not enough unless domination also should be sought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
their great ambition being that which the same poet puts into
the mouth of Jupiter:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Which things, indeed, Virgil makes Jupiter predict as future,
whilst, in reality, he was only himself passing in review in his
own mind things which were already done, and which were
beheld by him as present realities. But I have mentioned
them with the intention of showing that, next to liberty, the
Romans so highly esteemed domination, that it received a
place among those things on which they bestowed the greatest
praise. Hence also it is that that poet, preferring to the arts
of other nations those arts which peculiarly belong to the
Romans, namely, the arts of ruling and commanding, and of
subjugating and vanquishing nations, says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Others, belike, with happier grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From bronze or stone shall call the face,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Be this thy genius, to impose<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The rule of peace on vanquished foes,<br /></span>

<span class="i7">And crush the sons of pride."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These arts they exercised with the more skill the less they
gave themselves up to pleasures, and to enervation of body
and mind in coveting and amassing riches, and through these
corrupting morals, by extorting them from the miserable
citizens and lavishing them on base stage-players. Hence
these men of base character, who abounded when Sallust
wrote and Virgil sang these things, did not seek after honours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and glory by these arts, but by treachery and deceit. Wherefore
the same says, "But at first it was rather ambition than
avarice that stirred the minds of men, which vice, however, is
nearer to virtue. For glory, honour, and power are desired
alike by the good man and by the ignoble; but the former,"
he says, "strives onward to them by the true way, whilst
the other, knowing nothing of the good arts, seeks them
by fraud and deceit."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> And what is meant by seeking the
attainment of glory, honour, and power by good arts, is to seek
them by virtue, and not by deceitful intrigue; for the good
and the ignoble man alike desire these things, but the good
man strives to overtake them by the true way. The way is
virtue, along which he presses as to the goal of possession&mdash;namely,
to glory, honour, and power. Now that this was a
sentiment engrained in the Roman mind, is indicated even
by the temples of their gods; for they built in very close
proximity the temples of Virtue and Honour, worshipping
as gods the gifts of God. Hence we can understand what
they who were good thought to be the end of virtue, and to
what they ultimately referred it, namely, to honour; for, as
to the bad, they had no virtue though they desired honour,
and strove to possess it by fraud and deceit. Praise of a
higher kind is bestowed upon Cato, for he says of him,
"The less he sought glory, the more it followed him."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We
say praise of a higher kind; for the glory with the desire
of which the Romans burned is the judgment of men thinking
well of men. And therefore virtue is better, which is
content with no human judgment save that of one's own conscience.
Whence the apostle says, "For this is our glory,
the testimony of our conscience."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> And in another place he
says, "But let every one prove his own work, and then he
shall have glory in himself, and not in another."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> That glory,
honour, and power, therefore, which they desired for themselves,
and to which the good sought to attain by good arts,
should not be sought after by virtue, but virtue by them.
For there is no true virtue except that which is directed
towards that end in which is the highest and ultimate good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of man. Wherefore even the honours which Cato sought he
ought not to have sought, but the state ought to have conferred
them on him unsolicited, on account of his virtues.</p>

<p>But, of the two great Romans of that time, Cato was he
whose virtue was by far the nearest to the true idea of virtue.
Wherefore, let us refer to the opinion of Cato himself, to discover
what was the judgment he had formed concerning the
condition of the state both then and in former times. "I do
not think," he says, "that it was by arms that our ancestors
made the republic great from being small. Had that been the
case, the republic of our day would have been by far more
flourishing than that of their times, for the number of our
allies and citizens is far greater; and, besides, we possess a
far greater abundance of armour and of horses than they did.
But it was other things than these that made them great, and
we have none of them: industry at home, just government
without, a mind free in deliberation, addicted neither to crime
nor to lust. Instead of these, we have luxury and avarice,
poverty in the state, opulence among citizens; we laud riches,
we follow laziness; there is no difference made between the
good and the bad; all the rewards of virtue are got possession
of by intrigue. And no wonder, when every individual consults
only for his own good, when ye are the slaves of pleasure
at home, and, in public affairs, of money and favour, no wonder
that an onslaught is made upon the unprotected republic."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>He who hears these words of Cato or of Sallust probably
thinks that such praise bestowed on the ancient Romans was
applicable to all of them, or, at least, to very many of them.
It is not so; otherwise the things which Cato himself writes,
and which I have quoted in the second book of this work,
would not be true. In that passage he says, that even from
the very beginning of the state wrongs were committed by
the more powerful, which led to the separation of the people
from the fathers, besides which there were other internal dissensions;
and the only time at which there existed a just and
moderate administration was after the banishment of the kings,
and that no longer than whilst they had cause to be afraid of
Tarquin, and were carrying on the grievous war which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
been undertaken on his account against Etruria; but afterwards
the fathers oppressed the people as slaves, flogged them
as the kings had done, drove them from their land, and, to
the exclusion of all others, held the government in their own
hands alone. And to these discords, whilst the fathers were
wishing to rule, and the people were unwilling to serve, the
second Punic war put an end; for again great fear began to
press upon their disquieted minds, holding them back from
those distractions by another and greater anxiety, and bringing
them back to civil concord. But the great things which
were then achieved were accomplished through the administration
of a few men, who were good in their own way. And
by the wisdom and forethought of these few good men, which
first enabled the republic to endure these evils and mitigated
them, it waxed greater and greater. And this the same historian
affirms, when he says that, reading and hearing of the
many illustrious achievements of the Roman people in peace
and in war, by land and by sea, he wished to understand what
it was by which these great things were specially sustained.
For he knew that very often the Romans had with a small
company contended with great legions of the enemy; and he
knew also that with small resources they had carried on wars
with opulent kings. And he says that, after having given
the matter much consideration, it seemed evident to him that
the pre-eminent virtue of a few citizens had achieved the
whole, and that that explained how poverty overcame wealth,
and small numbers great multitudes. But, he adds, after that
the state had been corrupted by luxury and indolence, again
the republic, by its own greatness, was able to bear the vices
of its magistrates and generals. Wherefore even the praises
of Cato are only applicable to a few; for only a few were
possessed of that virtue which leads men to pursue after
glory, honour, and power by the true way,&mdash;that is, by virtue
itself. This industry at home, of which Cato speaks, was the
consequence of a desire to enrich the public treasury, even
though the result should be poverty at home; and therefore,
when he speaks of the evil arising out of the corruption of
morals, he reverses the expression, and says, "Poverty in the
state, riches at home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Concerning the love of praise, which, though it is a vice, is reckoned a virtue,
because by it greater vice is restrained.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore, when the kingdoms of the East had been illustrious
for a long time, it pleased God that there should also
arise a Western empire, which, though later in time, should
be more illustrious in extent and greatness. And, in order
that it might overcome the grievous evils which existed among
other nations, He purposely granted it to such men as, for the
sake of honour, and praise, and glory, consulted well for their
country, in whose glory they sought their own, and whose
safety they did not hesitate to prefer to their own, suppressing
the desire of wealth and many other vices for this one vice,
namely, the love of praise. For he has the soundest perception
who recognises that even the love of praise is a vice;
nor has this escaped the perception of the poet Horace, who
says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You're bloated by ambition? take advice:<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>And the same poet, in a lyric song, hath thus spoken with
the desire of repressing the passion for domination:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rule an ambitious spirit, and thou hast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A wider kingdom than if thou shouldst join<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Nevertheless, they who restrain baser lusts, not by the
power of the Holy Spirit obtained by the faith of piety,
or by the love of intelligible beauty, but by desire of human
praise, or, at all events, restrain them better by the love of
such praise, are not indeed yet holy, but only less base.
Even Tully was not able to conceal this fact; for, in the
same books which he wrote, <i>De Republica</i>, when speaking
concerning the education of a chief of the state, who ought,
he says, to be nourished on glory, goes on to say that their
ancestors did many wonderful and illustrious things through
desire of glory. So far, therefore, from resisting this vice, they
even thought that it ought to be excited and kindled up, supposing
that that would be beneficial to the republic. But not
even in his books on philosophy does Tully dissimulate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
poisonous opinion, for he there avows it more clearly than
day. For when he is speaking of those studies which are to
be pursued with a view to the <i>true good</i>, and not with the
vainglorious desire of human praise, he introduces the following
universal and general statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Honour nourishes the arts, and all are stimulated to the prosecution of
studies by glory; and those pursuits are always neglected which are generally
discredited."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p></blockquote>


<p class="center">14. <i>Concerning the eradication of the love of human praise, because all the glory
of the righteous is in God.</i></p>

<p>It is, therefore, doubtless far better to resist this desire
than to yield to it, for the purer one is from this defilement,
the liker is he to God; and, though this vice be not
thoroughly eradicated from his heart,&mdash;for it does not cease to
tempt even the minds of those who are making good progress
in virtue,&mdash;at any rate, let the desire of glory be surpassed by
the love of righteousness, so that, if there be seen anywhere
"lying neglected things which are generally discredited," if
they are good, if they are right, even the love of human
praise may blush and yield to the love of truth. For so
hostile is this vice to pious faith, if the love of glory be
greater in the heart than the fear or love of God, that the
Lord said, "How can ye believe, who look for glory from one
another, and do not seek the glory which is from God alone?"<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Also, concerning some who had believed on Him, but were
afraid to confess Him openly, the evangelist says, "They loved
the praise of men more than the praise of God;"<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> which did
not the holy apostles, who, when they proclaimed the name
of Christ in those places where it was not only discredited,
and therefore neglected,&mdash;according as Cicero says, "Those
things are always neglected which are generally discredited,"&mdash;but
was even held in the utmost detestation, holding to
what they had heard from the Good Master, who was also
the physician of minds, "If any one shall deny me before
men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven,
and before the angels of God,"<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> amidst maledictions and
reproaches, and most grievous persecutions and cruel punishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
were not deterred from the preaching of human salvation
by the noise of human indignation. And when, as they
did and spake divine things, and lived divine lives, conquering,
as it were, hard hearts, and introducing into them the peace
of righteousness, great glory followed them in the church
of Christ, they did not rest in that as in the end of their
virtue, but, referring that glory itself to the glory of God, by
whose grace they were what they were, they sought to kindle,
also by that same flame, the minds of those for whose good
they consulted, to the love of Him, by whom they could be
made to be what they themselves were. For their Master had
taught them not to seek to be good for the sake of human
glory, saying, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness
before men to be seen of them, or otherwise ye shall not
have a reward from your Father who is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> But
again, lest, understanding this wrongly, they should, through
fear of pleasing men, be less useful through concealing their
goodness, showing for what end they ought to make it known,
He says, "Let your works shine before men, that they may
see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Not, observe, "that ye may be seen by them, that
is, in order that their eyes may be directed upon you,"&mdash;for
of yourselves ye are nothing,&mdash;but "that they may glorify
your Father who is in heaven," by fixing their regards on
whom they may become such as ye are. These the martyrs
followed, who surpassed the Scævolas, and the Curtiuses, and
the Deciuses, both in true virtue, because in true piety,
and also in the greatness of their number. But since those
Romans were in an earthly city, and had before them, as
the end of all the offices undertaken in its behalf, its safety,
and a kingdom, not in heaven, but in earth,&mdash;not in the sphere
of eternal life, but in the sphere of demise and succession,
where the dead are succeeded by the dying,&mdash;what else but
glory should they love, by which they wished even after
death to live in the mouths of their admirers?</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Concerning the temporal reward which God granted to the virtues of the
Romans.</i></p>

<p>Now, therefore, with regard to those to whom God did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
purpose to give eternal life with His holy angels in His own
celestial city, to the society of which that true piety which
does not render the service of religion, which the Greeks call
&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, to any save the true God conducts, if He had also
withheld from them the terrestrial glory of that most excellent
empire, a reward would not have been rendered to their good
arts,&mdash;that is, their virtues,&mdash;by which they sought to attain
so great glory. For as to those who seem to do some good
that they may receive glory from men, the Lord also says,
"Verily I say unto you, they have received their reward."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
So also these despised their own private affairs for the sake
of the republic, and for its treasury resisted avarice, consulted
for the good of their country with a spirit of freedom, addicted
neither to what their laws pronounced to be crime nor to lust.
By all these acts, as by the true way, they pressed forward to
honours, power, and glory; they were honoured among almost
all nations; they imposed the laws of their empire upon many
nations; and at this day, both in literature and history, they
are glorious among almost all nations. There is no reason why
they should complain against the justice of the supreme and
true God,&mdash;"they have received their reward."</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Concerning the reward of the holy citizens of the celestial city, to whom the
example of the virtues of the Roman are useful.</i></p>

<p>But the reward of the saints is far different, who even
here endured reproaches for that city of God which is hateful
to the lovers of this world. That city is eternal. There
none are born, for none die. There is true and full felicity,&mdash;not
a goddess, but a gift of God. Thence we receive the
pledge of faith, whilst on our pilgrimage we sigh for its
beauty. There rises not the sun on the good and the evil, but
the Sun of Righteousness protects the good alone. There no
great industry shall be expended to enrich the public treasury
by suffering privations at home, for there is the common
treasury of truth. And, therefore, it was not only for the
sake of recompensing the citizens of Rome that her empire
and glory had been so signally extended, but also that the
citizens of that eternal city, during their pilgrimage here,
might diligently and soberly contemplate these examples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
see what a love they owe to the supernal country on account
of life eternal, if the terrestrial country was so much beloved
by its citizens on account of human glory.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>To what profit the Romans carried on wars, and how much they contributed
to the well-being of those whom they conquered.</i></p>

<p>For, as far as this life of mortals is concerned, which is
spent and ended in a few days, what does it matter under
whose government a dying man lives, if they who govern do
not force him to impiety and iniquity? Did the Romans at
all harm those nations, on whom, when subjugated, they imposed
their laws, except in as far as that was accomplished
with great slaughter in war? Now, had it been done with
consent of the nations, it would have been done with greater
success, but there would have been no glory of conquest, for
neither did the Romans themselves live exempt from those
laws which they imposed on others. Had this been done
without Mars and Bellona, so that there should have been no
place for victory, no one conquering where no one had fought,
would not the condition of the Romans and of the other
nations have been one and the same, especially if that had been
done at once which afterwards was done most humanely and
most acceptably, namely, the admission of all to the rights of
Roman citizens who belonged to the Roman empire, and if
that had been made the privilege of all which was formerly
the privilege of a few, with this one condition, that the
humbler class who had no lands of their own should live at
the public expense&mdash;an alimentary impost, which would have
been paid with a much better grace by them into the hands
of good administrators of the republic, of which they were
members, by their own hearty consent, than it would have
been paid with had it to be extorted from them as conquered
men? For I do not see what it makes for the safety, good
morals, and certainly not for the dignity, of men, that some
have conquered and others have been conquered, except that
it yields them that most insane pomp of human glory, in
which "they have received their reward," who burned with
excessive desire of it, and carried on most eager wars. For
do not their lands pay tribute? Have they any privilege of
learning what the others are not privileged to learn? Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
there not many senators in the other countries who do not
even know Rome by sight? Take away outward show,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and
what are all men after all but men? But even though the
perversity of the age should permit that all the better men
should be more highly honoured than others, neither thus
should human honour be held at a great price, for it is smoke
which has no weight. But let us avail ourselves even in
these things of the kindness of God. Let us consider how
great things they despised, how great things they endured,
what lusts they subdued for the sake of human glory, who
merited that glory, as it were, in reward for such virtues; and
let this be useful to us even in suppressing pride, so that, as
that city in which it has been promised us to reign as far
surpasses this one as heaven is distant from the earth, as
eternal life surpasses temporal joy, solid glory empty praise,
or the society of angels the society of mortals, or the glory of
Him who made the sun and moon the light of the sun and
moon, the citizens of so great a country may not seem to
themselves to have done anything very great, if, in order to
obtain it, they have done some good works or endured some
evils, when those men for this terrestrial country already obtained,
did such great things, suffered such great things. And
especially are all these things to be considered, because the
remission of sins which collects citizens to the celestial country
has something in it to which a shadowy resemblance is found
in that asylum of Romulus, whither escape from the punishment
of all manner of crimes congregated that multitude with
which the state was to be founded.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>18. <i>How far Christians ought to be from boasting, if they have done anything
for the love of the eternal country, when the Romans did such great
things for human glory and a terrestrial city.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What great thing, therefore, is it for that eternal and celestial
city to despise all the charms of this world, however pleasant,
if for the sake of this terrestrial city Brutus could even put
to death his son,&mdash;a sacrifice which the heavenly city compels
no one to make? But certainly it is more difficult to put to
death one's sons, than to do what is required to be done for
the heavenly country, even to distribute to the poor those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
things which were looked upon as things to be amassed and
laid up for one's children, or to let them go, if there arise any
temptation which compels us to do so, for the sake of faith and
righteousness. For it is not earthly riches which make us or
our sons happy; for they must either be lost by us in our lifetime,
or be possessed when we are dead, by whom we know not,
or perhaps by whom we would not. But it is God who makes
us happy, who is the true riches of minds. But of Brutus,
even the poet who celebrates his praises testifies that it was
the occasion of unhappiness to him that he slew his son, for
he says,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>There are those two things, namely, liberty and the desire
of human praise, which compelled the Romans to admirable
deeds. If, therefore, for the liberty of dying men, and for
the desire of human praise which is sought after by mortals,
sons could be put to death by a father, what great thing is it,
if, for the true liberty which has made us free from the dominion
of sin, and death, and the devil,&mdash;not through the desire
of human praise, but through the earnest desire of freeing men,
not from King Tarquin, but from demons and the prince of
the demons,&mdash;we should, I do not say put to death our sons,
but reckon among our sons Christ's poor ones? If, also,
another Roman chief, surnamed Torquatus, slew his son, not
because he fought against his country, but because, being
challenged by an enemy, he through youthful impetuosity
fought, though for his country, yet contrary to orders which
he his father had given as general; and this he did, notwithstanding
that his son was victorious, lest there should be more
evil in the example of authority despised, than good in the
glory of slaying an enemy;&mdash;if, I say, Torquatus acted thus,
wherefore should they boast themselves, who, for the laws of
a celestial country, despise all earthly good things, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
loved far less than sons? If Furius Camillus, who was condemned
by those who envied him, notwithstanding that he
had thrown off from the necks of his countrymen the yoke of
their most bitter enemies, the Veientes, again delivered his
ungrateful country from the Gauls, because he had no other
in which he could have better opportunities for living a life
of glory;&mdash;if Camillus did thus, why should he be extolled as
having done some great thing, who, having, it may be, suffered
in the church at the hands of carnal enemies most grievous
and dishonouring injury, has not betaken himself to heretical
enemies, or himself raised some heresy against her, but has
rather defended her, as far as he was able, from the most pernicious
perversity of heretics, since there is not another church,
I say not in which one can live a life of glory, but in which
eternal life can be obtained? If Mucius, in order that peace
might be made with King Porsenna, who was pressing the
Romans with a most grievous war, when he did not succeed
in slaying Porsenna, but slew another by mistake for him,
reached forth his right hand and laid it on a red-hot altar,
saying that many such as he saw him to be had conspired for
his destruction, so that Porsenna, terrified at his daring, and at
the thought of a conspiracy of such as he, without any delay
recalled all his warlike purposes, and made peace;&mdash;if, I say,
Mucius did this, who shall speak of his meritorious claims to
the kingdom of heaven, if for it he may have given to the flames
not one hand, but even his whole body, and that not by his own
spontaneous act, but because he was persecuted by another?
If Curtius, spurring on his steed, threw himself all armed
into a precipitous gulf, obeying the oracles of their gods,
which had commanded that the Romans should throw into
that gulf the best thing which they possessed, and they could
only understand thereby that, since they excelled in men and
arms, the gods had commanded that an armed man should be
cast headlong into that destruction;&mdash;if he did this, shall we
say that that man has done a great thing for the eternal city
who may have died by a like death, not, however, precipitating
himself spontaneously into a gulf, but having suffered this
death at the hands of some enemy of his faith, more especially
when he has received from his Lord, who is also King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
his country, a more certain oracle, "Fear not them who kill
the body, but cannot kill the soul?"<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> If the Decii dedicated
themselves to death, consecrating themselves in a form of
words, as it were, that falling, and pacifying by their blood
the wrath of the gods, they might be the means of delivering
the Roman army;&mdash;if they did this, let not the holy martyrs
carry themselves proudly, as though they had done some meritorious
thing for a share in that country where are eternal life
and felicity, if even to the shedding of their blood, loving not
only the brethren for whom it was shed, but, according as had
been commanded them, even their enemies by whom it was
being shed, they have vied with one another in faith of love
and love of faith. If Marcus Pulvillus, when engaged in
dedicating a temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, received
with such indifference the false intelligence which was brought
to him of the death of his son, with the intention of so agitating
him that he should go away, and thus the glory of dedicating
the temple should fall to his colleague;&mdash;if he received
that intelligence with such indifference that he even ordered
that his son should be cast out unburied, the love of glory
having overcome in his heart the grief of bereavement, how
shall any one affirm that he has done a great thing for the
preaching of the gospel, by which the citizens of the heavenly
city are delivered from divers errors, and gathered together
from divers wanderings, to whom his Lord has said, when
anxious about the burial of his father, "Follow me, and let
the dead bury their dead?"<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Regulus, in order not to break
his oath, even with his most cruel enemies, returned to them
from Rome itself, because (as he is said to have replied to the
Romans when they wished to retain him) he could not have
the dignity of an honourable citizen at Rome after having been
a slave to the Africans, and the Carthaginians put him to
death with the utmost tortures, because he had spoken against
them in the senate. If Regulus acted thus, what tortures are
not to be despised for the sake of good faith toward that
country to whose beatitude faith itself leads? Or what will
a man have rendered to the Lord for all He has bestowed upon
him, if, for the faithfulness he owes to Him, he shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
suffered such things as Regulus suffered at the hands of his
most ruthless enemies for the good faith which he owed to
them? And how shall a Christian dare vaunt himself of his
voluntary poverty, which he has chosen in order that during
the pilgrimage of this life he may walk the more disencumbered
on the way which leads to the country where the true riches
are, even God Himself;&mdash;how, I say, shall he vaunt himself
for this, when he hears or reads that Lucius Valerius, who
died when he was holding the office of consul, was so poor
that his funeral expenses were paid with money collected by
the people?&mdash;or when he hears that Quintius Cincinnatus,
who, possessing only four acres of land, and cultivating them
with his own hands, was taken from the plough to be made
dictator,&mdash;an office more honourable even than that of consul,&mdash;and
that, after having won great glory by conquering the
enemy, he preferred notwithstanding to continue in his poverty?
Or how shall he boast of having done a great thing, who has
not been prevailed upon by the offer of any reward of this
world to renounce his connection with that heavenly and
eternal country, when he hears that Fabricius could not be prevailed
on to forsake the Roman city by the great gifts offered
to him by Pyrrhus king of the Epirots, who promised him the
fourth part of his kingdom, but preferred to abide there in his
poverty as a private individual? For if, when their republic,&mdash;that
is, the interest of the people, the interest of the country,
the common interest,&mdash;was most prosperous and wealthy, they
themselves were so poor in their own houses, that one of them,
who had already been twice a consul, was expelled from that
senate of poor men by the censor, because he was discovered
to possess ten pounds weight of silver-plate,&mdash;since, I say,
those very men by whose triumphs the public treasury was
enriched were so poor, ought not all Christians, who make
common property of their riches with a far nobler purpose,
even that (according to what is written in the Acts of the
Apostles) they may distribute to each one according to his
need, and that no one may say that anything is his own, but
that all things may be their common possession,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>&mdash;ought they
not to understand that they should not vaunt themselves, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
they do that to obtain the society of angels, when those
men did well-nigh the same thing to preserve the glory of the
Romans?</p>

<p>How could these, and whatever like things are found in the
Roman history, have become so widely known, and have been
proclaimed by so great a fame, had not the Roman empire,
extending far and wide, been raised to its greatness by magnificent
successes? Wherefore, through that empire, so extensive
and of so long continuance, so illustrious and glorious
also through the virtues of such great men, the reward which
they sought was rendered to their earnest aspirations, and also
examples are set before us, containing necessary admonition,
in order that we may be stung with shame if we shall see that
we have not held fast those virtues for the sake of the most
glorious city of God, which are, in whatever way, resembled
by those virtues which they held fast for the sake of the glory
of a terrestrial city, and that, too, if we shall feel conscious
that we have held them fast, we may not be lifted up with
pride, because, as the apostle says, "The sufferings of the
present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory
which shall be revealed in us."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> But so far as regards human
and temporal glory, the lives of these ancient Romans were
reckoned sufficiently worthy. Therefore, also, we see, in the
light of that truth which, veiled in the Old Testament, is revealed
in the New, namely, that it is not in view of terrestrial
and temporal benefits, which divine providence grants promiscuously
to good and evil, that God is to be worshipped, but in
view of eternal life, everlasting gifts, and of the society of the
heavenly city itself;&mdash;in the light of this truth we see that
the Jews were most righteously given as a trophy to the glory
of the Romans; for we see that these Romans, who rested on
earthly glory, and sought to obtain it by virtues, such as they
were, conquered those who, in their great depravity, slew and
rejected the giver of true glory, and of the eternal city.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Concerning the difference between true glory and the desire of domination.</i></p>

<p>There is assuredly a difference between the desire of human
glory and the desire of domination; for, though he who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
an overweening delight in human glory will be also very prone
to aspire earnestly after domination, nevertheless they who
desire the true glory even of human praise strive not to displease
those who judge well of them. For there are many
good moral qualities, of which many are competent judges,
although they are not possessed by many; and by those good
moral qualities those men press on to glory, honour, and domination,
of whom Sallust says, "But they press on by the true
way."</p>

<p>But whosoever, without possessing that desire of glory
which makes one fear to displease those who judge his conduct,
desires domination and power, very often seeks to obtain
what he loves by most open crimes. Therefore he who desires
glory presses on to obtain it either by the true way, or certainly
by deceit and artifice, wishing to appear good when
he is not. Therefore to him who possesses virtues it is a
great virtue to despise glory; for contempt of it is seen by
God, but is not manifest to human judgment. For whatever
any one does before the eyes of men in order to show himself
to be a despiser of glory, if they suspect that he is doing it
in order to get greater praise,&mdash;that is, greater glory,&mdash;he has
no means of demonstrating to the perceptions of those who
suspect him that the case is really otherwise than they suspect
it to be. But he who despises the judgment of praisers,
despises also the rashness of suspectors. Their salvation, indeed,
he does not despise, if he is truly good; for so great is
the righteousness of that man who receives his virtues from
the Spirit of God, that he loves his very enemies, and so loves
them that he desires that his haters and detractors may be
turned to righteousness, and become his associates, and that not
in an earthly but in a heavenly country. But with respect
to his praisers, though he sets little value on their praise, he
does not set little value on their love; neither does he elude
their praise, lest he should forfeit their love. And, therefore,
he strives earnestly to have their praises directed to Him from
whom every one receives whatever in him is truly praiseworthy.
But he who is a despiser of glory, but is greedy of
domination, exceeds the beasts in the vices of cruelty and
luxuriousness. Such, indeed, were certain of the Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
who, wanting the love of esteem, wanted not the thirst for
domination; and that there were many such, history testifies.
But it was Nero Cæsar who was the first to reach the summit,
and, as it were, the citadel, of this vice; for so great was his
luxuriousness, that one would have thought there was nothing
manly to be dreaded in him, and such his cruelty, that, had
not the contrary been known, no one would have thought
there was anything effeminate in his character. Nevertheless
power and domination are not given even to such men save
by the providence of the most high God, when He judges that
the state of human affairs is worthy of such lords. The divine
utterance is clear on this matter; for the Wisdom of God thus
speaks: "By me kings reign, and tyrants possess the land."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
But, that it may not be thought that by "tyrants" is meant,
not wicked and impious kings, but brave men, in accordance
with the ancient use of the word, as when Virgil says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For know that treaty may not stand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where king greets king and joins not hand,"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>in another place it is most unambiguously said of God, that
He "maketh the man who is an hypocrite to reign on account
of the perversity of the people."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Wherefore, though I have,
according to my ability, shown for what reason God, who
alone is true and just, helped forward the Romans, who were
good according to a certain standard of an earthly state, to
the acquirement of the glory of so great an empire, there may
be, nevertheless, a more hidden cause, known better to God
than to us, depending on the diversity of the merits of the
human race. Among all who are truly pious, it is at all
events agreed that no one without true piety&mdash;that is, true
worship of the true God&mdash;can have true virtue; and that it
is not true virtue which is the slave of human praise. Though,
nevertheless, they who are not citizens of the eternal city,
which is called the city of God in the sacred Scriptures, are
more useful to the earthly city when they possess even that
virtue than if they had not even that. But there could be
nothing more fortunate for human affairs than that, by the
mercy of God, they who are endowed with true piety of life,
if they have the skill for ruling people, should also have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
power. But such men, however great virtues they may possess
in this life, attribute it solely to the grace of God that He has
bestowed it on them&mdash;willing, believing, seeking. And, at
the same time, they understand how far they are short of that
perfection of righteousness which exists in the society of those
holy angels for which they are striving to fit themselves. But
however much that virtue may be praised and cried up, which
without true piety is the slave of human glory, it is not at
all to be compared even to the feeble beginnings of the virtue
of the saints, whose hope is placed in the grace and mercy of
the true God.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>That it is as shameful for the virtues to serve human glory as bodily pleasure.</i></p>

<p>Philosophers,&mdash;who place the end of human good in virtue
itself, in order to put to shame certain other philosophers, who
indeed approve of the virtues, but measure them all with
reference to the end of bodily pleasure, and think that this
pleasure is to be sought for its own sake, but the virtues on
account of pleasure,&mdash;are wont to paint a kind of word-picture,
in which Pleasure sits like a luxurious queen on a royal seat,
and all the virtues are subjected to her as slaves, watching her
nod, that they may do whatever she shall command. She
commands Prudence to be ever on the watch to discover
how Pleasure may rule, and be safe. Justice she orders to
grant what benefits she can, in order to secure those friendships
which are necessary for bodily pleasure; to do wrong
to no one, lest, on account of the breaking of the laws, Pleasure
be not able to live in security. Fortitude she orders to keep
her mistress, that is, Pleasure, bravely in her mind, if any
affliction befall her body which does not occasion death, in
order that by remembrance of former delights she may mitigate
the poignancy of present pain. Temperance she commands
to take only a certain quantity even of the most
favourite food, lest, through immoderate use, anything prove
hurtful by disturbing the health of the body, and thus Pleasure,
which the Epicureans make to consist chiefly in the health
of the body, be grievously offended. Thus the virtues, with
the whole dignity of their glory, will be the slaves of Pleasure,
as of some imperious and disreputable woman.</p>

<p>There is nothing, say our philosophers, more disgraceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and monstrous than this picture, and which the eyes of good
men can less endure. And they say the truth. But I do
not think that the picture would be sufficiently becoming,
even if it were made so that the virtues should be represented
as the slaves of human glory; for, though that glory
be not a luxurious woman, it is nevertheless puffed up, and
has much vanity in it. Wherefore it is unworthy of the
solidity and firmness of the virtues to represent them as
serving this glory, so that Prudence shall provide nothing,
Justice distribute nothing, Temperance moderate nothing,
except to the end that men may be pleased and vainglory
served. Nor will they be able to defend themselves from the
charge of such baseness, whilst they, by way of being despisers
of glory, disregard the judgment of other men, seem to themselves
wise, and please themselves. For their virtue,&mdash;if, indeed,
it is virtue at all,&mdash;is only in another way subjected to
human praise; for he who seeks to please himself seeks still
to please man. But he who, with true piety towards God,
whom he loves, believes, and hopes in, fixes his attention more
on those things in which he displeases himself, than on those
things, if there are any such, which please himself, or rather,
not himself, but the truth, does not attribute that by which
he can now please the truth to anything but to the mercy of
Him whom he has feared to displease, giving thanks for what
in him is healed, and pouring out prayers for the healing of
that which is yet unhealed.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>That the Roman dominion was granted by Him from whom is all power,
and by whose providence all things are ruled.</i></p>

<p>These things being so, we do not attribute the power of
giving kingdoms and empires to any save to the true God,
who gives happiness in the kingdom of heaven to the pious
alone, but gives kingly power on earth both to the pious and
the impious, as it may please Him, whose good pleasure is
always just. For though we have said something about the
principles which guide His administration, in so far as it has
seemed good to Him to explain it, nevertheless it is too much
for us, and far surpasses our strength, to discuss the hidden
things of men's hearts, and by a clear examination to determine
the merits of various kingdoms. He, therefore, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the one true God, who never leaves the human race without
just judgment and help, gave a kingdom to the Romans when
He would, and as great as He would, as He did also to the
Assyrians, and even the Persians, by whom, as their own books
testify, only two gods are worshipped, the one good and the
other evil,&mdash;to say nothing concerning the Hebrew people, of
whom I have already spoken as much as seemed necessary,
who, as long as they were a kingdom, worshipped none save
the true God. The same, therefore, who gave to the Persians
harvests, though they did not worship the goddess Segetia,
who gave the other blessings of the earth, though they did
not worship the many gods which the Romans supposed to
preside, each one over some particular thing, or even many of
them over each several thing,&mdash;He, I say, gave the Persians
dominion, though they worshipped none of those gods to
whom the Romans believed themselves indebted for the
empire. And the same is true in respect of men as well
as nations. He who gave power to Marius gave it also to
Caius Cæsar; He who gave it to Augustus gave it also to
Nero; He also who gave it to the most benignant emperors,
the Vespasians, father and son, gave it also to the cruel
Domitian; and, finally, to avoid the necessity of going over
them all, He who gave it to the Christian Constantine gave
it also to the apostate Julian, whose gifted mind was deceived
by a sacrilegious and detestable curiosity, stimulated by the
love of power. And it was because he was addicted through
curiosity to vain oracles, that, confident of victory, he burned
the ships which were laden with the provisions necessary for
his army, and therefore, engaging with hot zeal in rashly
audacious enterprises, he was soon slain, as the just consequence
of his recklessness, and left his army unprovisioned
in an enemy's country, and in such a predicament that it
never could have escaped, save by altering the boundaries of
the Roman empire, in violation of that omen of the god Terminus
of which I spoke in the preceding book; for the god
Terminus yielded to necessity, though he had not yielded to
Jupiter. Manifestly these things are ruled and governed by
the one God according as He pleases; and if His motives are
hid, are they therefore unjust?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">22. <i>The durations and issues of war depend on the will of God.</i></p>

<p>Thus also the durations of wars are determined by Him
as He may see meet, according to His righteous will, and
pleasure, and mercy, to afflict or to console the human race,
so that they are sometimes of longer, sometimes of shorter
duration. The war of the Pirates and the third Punic war
were terminated with incredible celerity. Also the war of
the fugitive gladiators, though in it many Roman generals
and the consuls were defeated, and Italy was terribly wasted
and ravaged, was nevertheless ended in the third year, having
itself been, during its continuance, the end of much. The
Picentes, the Marsi, and the Peligni, not distant but Italian
nations, after a long and most loyal servitude under the
Roman yoke, attempted to raise their heads into liberty,
though many nations had now been subjected to the Roman
power, and Carthage had been overthrown. In this Italian
war the Romans were very often defeated, and two consuls
perished, besides other noble senators; nevertheless this calamity
was not protracted over a long space of time, for the
fifth year put an end to it. But the second Punic war, lasting
for the space of eighteen years, and occasioning the greatest
disasters and calamities to the republic, wore out and well-nigh
consumed the strength of the Romans; for in two battles
about seventy thousand Romans fell.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The first Punic war
was terminated after having been waged for three-and-twenty
years. The Mithridatic war was waged for forty years. And
that no one may think that in the early and much belauded
times of the Romans they were far braver and more able
to bring wars to a speedy termination, the Samnite war was
protracted for nearly fifty years; and in this war the Romans
were so beaten that they were even put under the yoke. But
because they did not love glory for the sake of justice, but
seemed rather to have loved justice for the sake of glory,
they broke the peace and the treaty which had been concluded.
These things I mention, because many, ignorant of past things,
and some also dissimulating what they know, if in Christian
times they see any war protracted a little longer than they
expected, straightway make a fierce and insolent attack on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
our religion, exclaiming that, but for it, the deities would have
been supplicated still, according to ancient rites; and then, by
that bravery of the Romans, which, with the help of Mars and
Bellona, speedily brought to an end such great wars, this war
also would be speedily terminated. Let them, therefore, who
have read history recollect what long-continued wars, having
various issues and entailing woful slaughter, were waged by
the ancient Romans, in accordance with the general truth
that the earth, like the tempestuous deep, is subject to agitations
from tempests&mdash;tempests of such evils, in various
degrees,&mdash;and let them sometimes confess what they do not
like to own, and not, by madly speaking against God, destroy
themselves and deceive the ignorant.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Concerning the war in which Radagaisus, king of the Goths, a worshipper
of demons, was conquered in one day, with all his mighty forces.</i></p>

<p>Nevertheless they do not mention with thanksgiving what
God has very recently, and within our own memory, wonderfully
and mercifully done, but as far as in them lies they
attempt, if possible, to bury it in universal oblivion. But
should we be silent about these things, we should be in like
manner ungrateful. When Radagaisus, king of the Goths,
having taken up his position very near to the city, with a vast
and savage army, was already close upon the Romans, he was
in one day so speedily and so thoroughly beaten, that, whilst
not even one Roman was wounded, much less slain, far more
than a hundred thousand of his army were prostrated, and he
himself and his sons, having been captured, were forthwith
put to death, suffering the punishment they deserved. For
had so impious a man, with so great and so impious a host,
entered the city, whom would he have spared? what tombs
of the martyrs would he have respected? in his treatment
of what person would he have manifested the fear of God?
whose blood would he have refrained from shedding? whose
chastity would he have wished to preserve inviolate? But
how loud would they not have been in the praises of their
gods! How insultingly they would have boasted, saying that
Radagaisus had conquered, that he had been able to achieve
such great things, because he propitiated and won over the
gods by daily sacrifices,&mdash;a thing which the Christian religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
did not allow the Romans to do! For when he was approaching
to those places where he was overwhelmed at the nod of
the Supreme Majesty, as his fame was everywhere increasing,
it was being told us at Carthage that the pagans were believing,
publishing, and boasting, that he, on account of the help
and protection of the gods friendly to him, because of the
sacrifices which he was said to be daily offering to them,
would certainly not be conquered by those who were not
performing such sacrifices to the Roman gods, and did not
even permit that they should be offered by any one. And
now these wretched men do not give thanks to God for His
great mercy, who, having determined to chastise the corruption
of men, which was worthy of far heavier chastisement
than the corruption of the barbarians, tempered His indignation
with such mildness as, in the first instance, to cause that
the king of the Goths should be conquered in a wonderful
manner, lest glory should accrue to demons, whom he was
known to be supplicating, and thus the minds of the weak
should be overthrown; and then, afterwards, to cause that,
when Rome was to be taken, it should be taken by those
barbarians who, contrary to any custom of all former wars,
protected, through reverence for the Christian religion, those
who fled for refuge to the sacred places, and who so opposed
the demons themselves, and the rites of impious sacrifices,
that they seemed to be carrying on a far more terrible war
with them than with men. Thus did the true Lord and Governor
of things both scourge the Romans mercifully, and, by the
marvellous defeat of the worshippers of demons, show that
those sacrifices were not necessary even for the safety of present
things; so that, by those who do not obstinately hold out,
but prudently consider the matter, true religion may not be
deserted on account of the urgencies of the present time, but
may be more clung to in most confident expectation of eternal
life.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>What was the happiness of the Christian emperors, and how far it was
true happiness.</i></p>

<p>For neither do we say that certain Christian emperors were
therefore happy because they ruled a long time, or, dying a
peaceful death, left their sons to succeed them in the empire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
or subdued the enemies of the republic, or were able both to
guard against and to suppress the attempt of hostile citizens
rising against them. These and other gifts or comforts of this
sorrowful life even certain worshippers of demons have merited
to receive, who do not belong to the kingdom of God to which
these belong; and this is to be traced to the mercy of God,
who would not have those who believe in Him desire such
things as the highest good. But we say that they are happy
if they rule justly; if they are not lifted up amid the praises
of those who pay them sublime honours, and the obsequiousness
of those who salute them with an excessive humility,
but remember that they are men; if they make their power
the handmaid of His majesty by using it for the greatest possible
extension of His worship; if they fear, love, worship
God; if more than their own they love that kingdom in which
they are not afraid to have partners; if they are slow to
punish, ready to pardon; if they apply that punishment as
necessary to government and defence of the republic, and not
in order to gratify their own enmity; if they grant pardon,
not that iniquity may go unpunished, but with the hope that
the transgressor may amend his ways; if they compensate
with the lenity of mercy and the liberality of benevolence
for whatever severity they may be compelled to decree; if
their luxury is as much restrained as it might have been
unrestrained; if they prefer to govern depraved desires rather
than any nation whatever; and if they do all these things,
not through ardent desire of empty glory, but through love of
eternal felicity, not neglecting to offer to the true God, who
is their God, for their sins, the sacrifices of humility, contrition,
and prayer. Such Christian emperors, we say, are happy
in the present time by hope, and are destined to be so in the
enjoyment of the reality itself, when that which we wait for
shall have arrived.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Concerning the prosperity which God granted to the Christian emperor
Constantine.</i></p>

<p>For the good God, lest men, who believe that He is to be
worshipped with a view to eternal life, should think that no
one could attain to all this high estate, and to this terrestrial
dominion, unless he should be a worshipper of the demons,&mdash;supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
that these spirits have great power with respect to
such things,&mdash;for this reason He gave to the Emperor Constantine,
who was not a worshipper of demons, but of the
true God Himself, such fulness of earthly gifts as no one
would even dare wish for. To him also He granted the
honour of founding a city,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> a companion to the Roman empire,
the daughter, as it were, of Rome itself, but without any
temple or image of the demons. He reigned for a long period
as sole emperor, and unaided held and defended the whole
Roman world. In conducting and carrying on wars he was
most victorious; in overthrowing tyrants he was most successful.
He died at a great age, of sickness and old age, and left
his sons to succeed him in the empire.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But again, lest any
emperor should become a Christian in order to merit the happiness
of Constantine, when every one should be a Christian
for the sake of eternal life, God took away Jovian far sooner
than Julian, and permitted that Gratian should be slain by
the sword of a tyrant. But in his case there was far more
mitigation of the calamity than in the case of the great
Pompey, for he could not be avenged by Cato, whom he had
left, as it were, heir to the civil war. But Gratian, though
pious minds require not such consolations, was avenged by
Theodosius, whom he had associated with himself in the
empire, though he had a little brother of his own, being more
desirous of a faithful alliance than of extensive power.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>On the faith and piety of Theodosius Augustus.</i></p>

<p>And on this account, Theodosius not only preserved during
the lifetime of Gratian that fidelity which was due to him,
but also, after his death, he, like a true Christian, took his
little brother Valentinian under his protection, as joint emperor,
after he had been expelled by Maximus, the murderer
of his father. He guarded him with paternal affection, though
he might without any difficulty have got rid of him, being
entirely destitute of all resources, had he been animated with
the desire of extensive empire, and not with the ambition of
being a benefactor. It was therefore a far greater pleasure to
him, when he had adopted the boy, and preserved to him his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
imperial dignity, to console him by his very humanity and
kindness. Afterwards, when that success was rendering
Maximus terrible, Theodosius, in the midst of his perplexing
anxieties, was not drawn away to follow the suggestions of a
sacrilegious and unlawful curiosity, but sent to John, whose
abode was in the desert of Egypt,&mdash;for he had learned that this
servant of God (whose fame was spreading abroad) was endowed
with the gift of prophecy,&mdash;and from him he received assurance
of victory. Immediately the slayer of the tyrant Maximus,
with the deepest feelings of compassion and respect, restored
the boy Valentinianus to his share in the empire from which
he had been driven. Valentinianus being soon after slain by
secret assassination, or by some other plot or accident, Theodosius,
having again received a response from the prophet,
and placing entire confidence in it, marched against the tyrant
Eugenius, who had been unlawfully elected to succeed that
emperor, and defeated his very powerful army, more by prayer
than by the sword. Some soldiers who were at the battle
reported to me that all the missiles they were throwing were
snatched from their hands by a vehement wind, which blew
from the direction of Theodosius' army upon the enemy; nor
did it only drive with greater velocity the darts which were
hurled against them, but also turned back upon their own
bodies the darts which they themselves were throwing. And
therefore the poet Claudian, although an alien from the name
of Christ, nevertheless says in his praises of him, "O prince,
too much beloved by God, for thee Æolus pours armed tempests
from their caves; for thee the air fights, and the winds with
one accord obey thy bugles."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But the victor, as he had
believed and predicted, overthrew the statues of Jupiter, which
had been, as it were, consecrated by I know not what kind
of rites against him, and set up in the Alps. And the
thunderbolts of these statues, which were made of gold, he
mirthfully and graciously presented to his couriers, who (as
the joy of the occasion permitted) were jocularly saying that
they would be most happy to be struck by such thunderbolts.
The sons of his own enemies, whose fathers had been slain
not so much by his orders as by the vehemence of war, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
fled for refuge to a church, though they were not yet Christians,
he was anxious, taking advantage of the occasion, to bring
over to Christianity, and treated them with Christian love.
Nor did he deprive them of their property, but, besides allowing
them to retain it, bestowed on them additional honours.
He did not permit private animosities to affect the treatment
of any man after the war. He was not like Cinna,
and Marius, and Sylla, and other such men, who wished
not to finish civil wars even when they were finished, but
rather grieved that they had arisen at all, than wished that
when they were finished they should harm any one. Amid
all these events, from the very commencement of his reign, he
did not cease to help the troubled church against the impious
by most just and merciful laws, which the heretical Valens,
favouring the Arians, had vehemently afflicted. Indeed, he
rejoiced more to be a member of this church than he did
to be a king upon the earth. The idols of the Gentiles he
everywhere ordered to be overthrown, understanding well that
not even terrestrial gifts are placed in the power of demons,
but in that of the true God. And what could be more admirable
than his religious humility, when, compelled by the
urgency of certain of his intimates, he avenged the grievous
crime of the Thessalonians, which at the prayer of the bishops
he had promised to pardon, and, being laid hold of by the
discipline of the church, did penance in such a way that the
sight of his imperial loftiness prostrated made the people who
were interceding for him weep more than the consciousness of
offence had made them fear it when enraged? These and
other similar good works, which it would be long to tell, he
carried with him from this world of time, where the greatest
human nobility and loftiness are but vapour. Of these works
the reward is eternal happiness, of which God is the giver,
though only to those who are sincerely pious. But all other
blessings and privileges of this life, as the world itself, light,
air, earth, water, fruits, and the soul of man himself, his body,
senses, mind, life, He lavishes on good and bad alike. And
among these blessings is also to be reckoned the possession of
an empire, whose extent He regulates according to the requirements
of His providential government at various times.
Whence, I see, we must now answer those who, being confuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and convicted by the most manifest proofs, by which it
is shown that for obtaining these terrestrial things, which are
all the foolish desire to have, that multitude of false gods is
of no use, attempt to assert that the gods are to be worshipped
with a view to the interest, not of the present life, but of that
which is to come after death. For as to those who, for the
sake of the friendship of this world, are willing to worship
vanities, and do not grieve that they are left to their puerile
understandings, I think they have been sufficiently answered
in these five books; of which books, when I had published
the first three, and they had begun to come into the hands of
many, I heard that certain persons were preparing against
them an answer of some kind or other in writing. Then it
was told me that they had already written their answer, but
were waiting a time when they could publish it without
danger. Such persons I would advise not to desire what
cannot be of any advantage to them; for it is very easy for
a man to seem to himself to have answered arguments, when
he has only been unwilling to be silent. For what is more
loquacious than vanity? And though it be able, if it like, to
shout more loudly than the truth, it is not, for all that, more
powerful than the truth. But let men consider diligently all
the things that we have said, and if, perchance, judging without
party spirit, they shall clearly perceive that they are such
things as may rather be shaken than torn up by their most
impudent garrulity, and, as it were, satirical and mimic levity,
let them restrain their absurdities, and let them choose rather
to be corrected by the wise than to be lauded by the foolish.
For if they are waiting an opportunity, not for liberty to speak
the truth, but for licence to revile, may not that befall them
which Tully says concerning some one, "Oh, wretched man!
who was at liberty to sin?"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Wherefore, whoever he be
who deems himself happy because of licence to revile, he
would be far happier if that were not allowed him at all; for
he might all the while, laying aside empty boast, be contradicting
those to whose views he is opposed by way of free
consultation with them, and be listening, as it becomes him,
honourably, gravely, candidly, to all that can be adduced by
those whom he consults by friendly disputation.</p>

<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>In the five former books, I think I have sufficiently disputed
against those who believe that the many false gods,
which the Christian truth shows to be useless images, or unclean
spirits and pernicious demons, or certainly creatures, not
the Creator, are to be worshipped for the advantage of this
mortal life, and of terrestrial affairs, with that rite and service
which the Greeks call &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, and which is due to the one
true God. And who does not know that, in the face of
excessive stupidity and obstinacy, neither these five nor any
other number of books whatsoever could be enough, when it is
esteemed the glory of vanity to yield to no amount of strength
on the side of truth,&mdash;certainly to his destruction over whom
so heinous a vice tyrannizes? For, notwithstanding all the
assiduity of the physician who attempts to effect a cure, the
disease remains unconquered, not through any fault of his, but
because of the incurableness of the sick man. But those who
thoroughly weigh the things which they read, having understood
and considered them, without any, or with no great and
excessive degree of that obstinacy which belongs to a long-cherished
error, will more readily judge that, in the five
books already finished, we have done more than the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of the question demanded, than that we have given it less
discussion than it required. And they cannot have doubted
but that all the hatred which the ignorant attempt to bring
upon the Christian religion on account of the disasters of this
life, and the destruction and change which befall terrestrial
things, whilst the learned do not merely dissimulate, but encourage
that hatred, contrary to their own consciences, being
possessed by a mad impiety;&mdash;they cannot have doubted, I say,
but that this hatred is devoid of right reflection and reason,
and full of most light temerity, and most pernicious animosity.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of those who maintain that they worship the gods not for the sake of
temporal, but eternal advantages.</i></p>

<p>Now, as, in the next place (as the promised order demands),
those are to be refuted and taught who contend that the gods
of the nations, which the Christian truth destroys, are to be
worshipped not on account of this life, but on account of that
which is to be after death, I shall do well to commence my
disputation with the truthful oracle of the holy psalm, "Blessed
is the man whose hope is the Lord God, and who respecteth
not Vanities and lying follies."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Nevertheless, in all vanities
and lying follies the philosophers are to be listened to with
far more toleration, who have repudiated those opinions and
errors of the people; for the people set up images to the
deities, and either feigned concerning those whom they call
immortal gods many false and unworthy things, or believed
them, already feigned, and, when believed, mixed them up
with their worship and sacred rites.</p>

<p>With those men who, though not by free avowal of their
convictions, do still testify that they disapprove of those things
by their muttering disapprobation during disputations on the
subject, it may not be very far amiss to discuss the following
question: Whether, for the sake of the life which is to be
after death, we ought to worship, not the one God, who made
all creatures spiritual and corporeal, but those many gods who,
as some of these philosophers hold, were made by that one God,
and placed by Him in their respective sublime spheres, and are
therefore considered more excellent and more noble than all the
others?<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> But who will assert that it must be affirmed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
contended that those gods, certain of whom I have mentioned
in the fourth book,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> to whom are distributed, each to each, the
charges of minute things, do bestow eternal life? But will those
most skilled and most acute men, who glory in having written
for the great benefit of men, to teach on what account each god
is to be worshipped, and what is to be sought from each, lest
with most disgraceful absurdity, such as a mimic is wont for
the sake of merriment to exhibit, water should be sought from
Liber, wine from the Lymphs,&mdash;will those men indeed affirm
to any man supplicating the immortal gods, that when he
shall have asked wine from the Lymphs, and they shall have
answered him, "We have water, seek wine from Liber," he
may rightly say, "If ye have not wine, at least give me
eternal life?" What more monstrous than this absurdity?
Will not these Lymphs,&mdash;for they are wont to be very easily
made laugh,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>&mdash;laughing loudly (if they do not attempt to
deceive like demons), answer the suppliant, "O man, dost
thou think that we have life (<i>vitam</i>) in our power, who thou
hearest have not even the vine (<i>vitem</i>)?" It is therefore most
impudent folly to seek and hope for eternal life from such
gods as are asserted so to preside over the separate minute
concernments of this most sorrowful and short life, and whatever
is useful for supporting and propping it, as that if anything
which is under the care and power of one be sought
from another, it is so incongruous and absurd that it appears
very like to mimic drollery,&mdash;which, when it is done by
mimics knowing what they are doing, is deservedly laughed
at in the theatre, but when it is done by foolish persons, who
do not know better, is more deservedly ridiculed in the world.
Wherefore, as concerns those gods which the states have
established, it has been cleverly invented and handed down to
memory by learned men, what god or goddess is to be supplicated
in relation to every particular thing,&mdash;what, for
instance, is to be sought from Liber, what from the Lymphs,
what from Vulcan, and so of all the rest, some of whom I
have mentioned in the fourth book, and some I have thought
right to omit. Further, if it is an error to seek wine from
Ceres, bread from Liber, water from Vulcan, fire from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Lymphs, how much greater absurdity ought it to be thought,
if supplication be made to any one of these for eternal life?</p>

<p>Wherefore, if, when we were inquiring what gods or goddesses
are to be believed to be able to confer earthly kingdoms
upon men, all things having been discussed, it was shown
to be very far from the truth to think that even terrestrial
kingdoms are established by any of those many false deities,
is it not most insane impiety to believe that eternal life,
which is, without any doubt or comparison, to be preferred
to all terrestrial kingdoms, can be given to any one by any of
these gods? For the reason why such gods seemed to us not
to be able to give even an earthly kingdom, was not because
they are very great and exalted, whilst that is something small
and abject, which they, in their so great sublimity, would
not condescend to care for, but because, however deservedly
any one may, in consideration of human frailty, despise the
falling pinnacles of an earthly kingdom, these gods have presented
such an appearance as to seem most unworthy to have
the granting and preserving of even those entrusted to them;
and consequently, if (as we have taught in the two last books
of our work, where this matter is treated of) no god out of all
that crowd, either belonging to, as it were, the plebeian or to
the noble gods, is fit to give mortal kingdoms to mortals, how
much less is he able to make immortals of mortals?</p>

<p>And more than this, if, according to the opinion of those
with whom we are now arguing, the gods are to be worshipped,
not on account of the present life, but of that which is to be
after death, then, certainly, they are not to be worshipped on
account of those particular things which are distributed and
portioned out (not by any law of rational truth, but by mere
vain conjecture) to the power of such gods, as they believe they
ought to be worshipped, who contend that their worship is necessary
for all the desirable things of this mortal life, against whom
I have disputed sufficiently, as far as I was able, in the five preceding
books. These things being so, if the age itself of those
who worshipped the goddess Juventas should be characterized
by remarkable vigour, whilst her despisers should either die
within the years of youth, or should, during that period, grow
cold as with the torpor of old age; if bearded Fortuna should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
cover the cheeks of her worshippers more handsomely and more
gracefully than all others, whilst we should see those by whom
she was despised either altogether beardless or ill-bearded;
even then we should most rightly say, that thus far these
several gods had power, limited in some way by their functions,
and that, consequently, neither ought eternal life to be sought
from Juventas, who could not give a beard, nor ought any
good thing after this life to be expected from Fortuna Barbata,
who has no power even in this life to give the age itself at
which the beard grows. But now, when their worship is
necessary not even on account of those very things which
they think are subjected to their power,&mdash;for many worshippers
of the goddess Juventas have not been at all vigorous at that
age, and many who do not worship her rejoice in youthful
strength; and also many suppliants of Fortuna Barbata have
either not been able to attain to any beard at all, not even an
ugly one, although they who adore her in order to obtain a
beard are ridiculed by her bearded despisers,&mdash;is the human
heart really so foolish as to believe that that worship of the
gods, which it acknowledges to be vain and ridiculous with
respect to those very temporal and swiftly passing gifts, over
each of which one of these gods is said to preside, is fruitful
in results with respect to eternal life? And that they are able
to give eternal life has not been affirmed even by those who,
that they might be worshipped by the silly populace, distributed
in minute division among them these temporal
occupations, that none of them might sit idle; for they had
supposed the existence of an exceedingly great number.</p>

<p>Who has investigated those things more carefully than
Marcus Varro? Who has discovered them more learnedly?
Who has considered them more attentively? Who has distinguished
them more acutely? Who has written about them
more diligently and more fully?&mdash;who, though he is less

as much as Cicero delights the student of words. And even
Tully himself renders him such testimony, as to say in his
Academic books that he had held that disputation which is
there carried on with Marcus Varro, "a man," he adds, "unquestionably
the acutest of all men, and, without any doubt,
the most learned."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> He does not say the most eloquent or
the most fluent, for in reality he was very deficient in this
faculty, but he says, "of all men the most acute." And
in those books,&mdash;that is, the Academic,&mdash;where he contends
that all things are to be doubted, he adds of him,
"without any doubt the most learned." In truth, he was so
certain concerning this thing, that he laid aside that doubt
which he is wont to have recourse to in all things, as if,
when about to dispute in favour of the doubt of the Academics,
he had, with respect to this one thing, forgotten
that he was an Academic. But in the first book, when he
extols the literary works of the same Varro, he says, "Us
straying and wandering in our own city like strangers, thy
books, as it were, brought home, that at length we might
come to know of who we were and where we were. Thou
hast opened up to us the age of the country, the distribution
of seasons, the laws of sacred things, and of the priests; thou
hast opened up to us domestic and public discipline; thou
hast pointed out to us the proper places for religious ceremonies,
and hast informed us concerning sacred places. Thou

and human things."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

learning, had he been an opposer and destroyer of the so-called
divine things of which he wrote, and had he said that they
pertained to superstition rather than to religion, might perhaps,
even in that case, not have written so many things
which are ridiculous, contemptible, detestable. But when he
so worshipped these same gods, and so vindicated their
worship, as to say, in that same literary work of his, that
he was afraid lest they should perish, not by an assault
by enemies, but by the negligence of the citizens, and that
from this ignominy they are being delivered by him, and are
being laid up and preserved in the memory of the good by
means of such books, with a zeal far more beneficial than that
through which Metellus is declared to have rescued the sacred
things of Vesta from the flames, and Æneas to have rescued
the Penates from the burning of Troy; and when he, nevertheless,
gives forth such things to be read by succeeding ages
as are deservedly judged by wise and unwise to be unfit to
be read, and to be most hostile to the truth of religion; what
ought we to think but that a most acute and learned man,&mdash;not,
however, made free by the Holy Spirit,&mdash;was overpowered
by the custom and laws of his state, and, not being able to be
silent about those things by which he was influenced, spoke
of them under pretence of commending religion?</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Varro's distribution of his book which he composed concerning the antiquities
of human and divine things.</i></p>

<p>He wrote forty-one books of antiquities. These he divided
into human and divine things. Twenty-five he devoted to
human things, sixteen to divine things; following this plan in
that division,&mdash;namely, to give six books to each of the four
divisions of human things. For he directs his attention to
these considerations: who perform, where they perform, when
they perform, what they perform. Therefore in the first six
books he wrote concerning men; in the second six, concerning
places; in the third six, concerning times; in the fourth and
last six, concerning things. Four times six, however, make
only twenty-four. But he placed at the head of them one
separate work, which spoke of all these things conjointly.</p>

<p>In divine things, the same order he preserved throughout,
as far as concerns those things which are performed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
gods. For sacred things are performed by men in places and
times. These four things I have mentioned he embraced in
twelve books, allotting three to each. For he wrote the first
three concerning men, the following three concerning places,
the third three concerning times, and the fourth three concerning
sacred rites,&mdash;showing who should perform, where they
should perform, when they should perform, what they should
perform, with most subtle distinction. But because it was
necessary to say&mdash;and that especially was expected&mdash;to whom
they should perform sacred rites, he wrote concerning the gods
themselves the last three books; and these five times three
made fifteen. But they are in all, as we have said, sixteen.
For he put also at the beginning of these one distinct book,
speaking by way of introduction of all which follows; which
being finished, he proceeded to subdivide the first three in
that fivefold distribution which pertain to men, making the
first concerning high priests, the second concerning augurs,
the third concerning the fifteen men presiding over the sacred
ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The second three he made concerning places,
speaking in one of them concerning their chapels, in the
second concerning their temples, and in the third concerning
religious places. The next three which follow these, and pertain
to times,&mdash;that is, to festival days,&mdash;he distributed so as
to make one concerning holidays, the other concerning the
circus games, and the third concerning scenic plays. Of the
fourth three, pertaining to sacred things, he devoted one to
consecrations, another to private, the last to public, sacred
rites. In the three which remain, the gods themselves follow
this pompous train, as it were, for whom all this culture has
been expended. In the first book are the certain gods, in the
second the uncertain, in the third, and last of all, the chief
and select gods.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>That from the disputation of Varro, it follows that the worshippers of the
gods regard human things as more ancient than divine things.</i></p>

<p>In this whole series of most beautiful and most subtle distributions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and distinctions, it will most easily appear evident
from the things we have said already, and from what is to be
said hereafter, to any man who is not, in the obstinacy of his
heart, an enemy to himself, that it is vain to seek and to hope
for, and even most impudent to wish for eternal life. For
these institutions are either the work of men, or of demons,&mdash;not
of those whom they call good demons, but, to speak more
plainly, of unclean, and, without controversy, malign spirits,
who with wonderful slyness and secretness suggest to the
thoughts of the impious, and sometimes openly present to
their understandings, noxious opinions, by which the human
mind grows more and more foolish, and becomes unable to
adapt itself to and abide in the immutable and eternal truth,
and seek to confirm these opinions by every kind of fallacious
attestation in their power. This very same Varro testifies
that he wrote first concerning human things, but afterwards
concerning divine things, because the states existed first, and
afterward these things were instituted by them. But the
true religion was not instituted by any earthly state, but
plainly it established the celestial city. It, however, is
inspired and taught by the true God, the giver of eternal life
to His true worshippers.</p>

<p>The following is the reason Varro gives when he confesses
that he had written first concerning human things, and afterwards
of divine things, because these divine things were instituted
by men:&mdash;"As the painter is before the painted
tablet, the mason before the edifice, so states are before those
things which are instituted by states." But he says that he
would have written first concerning the gods, afterwards concerning
men, if he had been writing concerning the whole
nature of the gods,&mdash;as if he were really writing concerning
some portion of, and not all, the nature of the gods; or as if,
indeed, some portion of, though not all, the nature of the gods
ought not to be put before that of men. How, then, comes it
that in those three last books, when he is diligently explaining
the certain, uncertain, and select gods, he seems to pass
over no portion of the nature of the gods? Why, then, does
he say, "If we had been writing on the whole nature of the
gods, we would first have finished the divine things before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
touched the human?" For he either writes concerning the
whole nature of the gods, or concerning some portion of it,
or concerning no part of it at all. If concerning it all, it is
certainly to be put before human things; if concerning some
part of it, why should it not, from the very nature of the case,
precede human things? Is not even some part of the gods
to be preferred to the whole of humanity? But if it is too
much to prefer a part of the divine to all human things, that
part is certainly worthy to be preferred to the Romans at
least. For he writes the books concerning human things, not
with reference to the whole world, but only to Rome; which
books he says he had properly placed, in the order of writing,
before the books on divine things, like a painter before the
painted tablet, or a mason before the building, most openly
confessing that, as a picture or a structure, even these divine
things were instituted by men. There remains only the third
supposition, that he is to be understood to have written concerning
no divine nature, but that he did not wish to say
this openly, but left it to the intelligent to infer; for when
one says "not all," usage understands that to mean "some,"
but it <i>may</i> be understood as meaning <i>none</i>, because that which
is <i>none</i> is neither all nor some. In fact, as he himself says,
if he had been writing concerning all the nature of the gods,
its due place would have been before human things in the
order of writing. But, as the truth declares, even though
Varro is silent, the divine nature should have taken precedence
of Roman things, though it were not <i>all</i>, but only <i>some</i>. But
it is properly put after, therefore it is <i>none</i>. His arrangement,
therefore, was due, not to a desire to give human things priority
to divine things, but to his unwillingness to prefer false things
to true. For in what he wrote on human things, he followed
the history of affairs; but in what he wrote concerning those
things which they call divine, what else did he follow but
mere conjectures about vain things? This, doubtless, is what,
in a subtle manner, he wished to signify; not only writing
concerning divine things after the human, but even giving
a reason why he did so; for if he had suppressed this, some,
perchance, would have defended his doing so in one way, and
some in another. But in that very reason he has rendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
he has left nothing for men to conjecture at will, and has sufficiently
proved that he preferred men to the institutions of
men, not the nature of men to the nature of the gods. Thus
he confessed that, in writing the books concerning divine
things, he did not write concerning the truth which belongs
to nature, but the falseness which belongs to error; which
he has elsewhere expressed more openly (as I have mentioned
in the fourth book<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>), saying that, had he been founding a new
city himself, he would have written according to the order of
nature; but as he had only found an old one, he could not
but follow its custom.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Concerning the three kinds of theology according to Varro, namely, one
fabulous, the other natural, the third civil.</i></p>

<p>Now what are we to say of this proposition of his, namely,
that there are three kinds of theology, that is, of the account
which is given of the gods; and of these, the one is called
mythical, the other physical, and the third civil? Did the
Latin usage permit, we should call the kind which he has
placed first in order <i>fabular</i>,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> but let us call it <i>fabulous</i>,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> for
mythical is derived from the Greek &#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962;, a fable; but that
the second should be called <i>natural</i>, the usage of speech now
admits; the third he himself has designated in Latin, calling
it <i>civil</i>.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Then he says, "they call that kind <i>mythical</i> which
the poets chiefly use; <i>physical</i>, that which the philosophers
use; <i>civil</i>, that which the people use. As to the first I have
mentioned," says he, "in it are many fictions, which are contrary
to the dignity and nature of the immortals. For we
find in it that one god has been born from the head, another
from the thigh, another from drops of blood; also, in this
we find that gods have stolen, committed adultery, served
men; in a word, in this all manner of things are attributed
to the gods, such as may befall, not merely any man, but
even the most contemptible man." He certainly, where
he could, where he dared, where he thought he could do
it with impunity, has manifested, without any of the haziness
of ambiguity, how great injury was done to the nature
of the gods by lying fables; for he was speaking, not concerning
natural theology, not concerning civil, but concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
fabulous theology, which he thought he could freely find fault
with.</p>

<p>Let us see, now, what he says concerning the second kind.
"The second kind which I have explained," he says, "is that
concerning which philosophers have left many books, in which
they treat such questions as these: what gods there are, where
they are, of what kind and character they are, since what time
they have existed, or if they have existed from eternity;
whether they are of fire, as Heraclitus believes; or of number,
as Pythagoras; or of atoms, as Epicurus says; and other such
things, which men's ears can more easily hear inside the walls
of a school than outside in the Forum." He finds fault with
nothing in this kind of theology which they call <i>physical</i>, and
which belongs to philosophers, except that he has related their
controversies among themselves, through which there has arisen
a multitude of dissentient sects. Nevertheless he has removed
this kind from the Forum, that is, from the populace, but he
has shut it up in schools. But that first kind, most false and
most base, he has not removed from the citizens. Oh, the religious
ears of the people, and among them even those of the
Romans, that are not able to bear what the philosophers dispute
concerning the gods! But when the poets sing and stage-players
act such things as are derogatory to the dignity and
the nature of the immortals, such as may befall not a man
merely, but the most contemptible man, they not only bear,
but willingly listen to. Nor is this all, but they even consider
that these things please the gods, and that they are
propitiated by them.</p>

<p>But some one may say, Let us distinguish these two kinds
of theology, the mythical and the physical,&mdash;that is, the
fabulous and the natural,&mdash;from this civil kind about which
we are now speaking. Anticipating this, he himself has distinguished
them. Let us see now how he explains the civil
theology itself. I see, indeed, why it should be distinguished
as fabulous, even because it is false, because it is base, because
it is unworthy. But to wish to distinguish the natural from
the civil, what else is that but to confess that the civil itself
is false? For if that be natural, what fault has it that it
should be excluded? And if this which is called civil be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
natural, what merit has it that it should be admitted? This,
in truth, is the cause why he wrote first concerning human
things, and afterwards concerning divine things; since in
divine things he did not follow nature, but the institution
of men. Let us look at this civil theology of his. "The
third kind," says he, "is that which citizens in cities, and
especially the priests, ought to know and to administer. From
it is to be known what god each one may suitably worship,
what sacred rites and sacrifices each one may suitably perform."
Let us still attend to what follows. "The first theology,"
he says, "is especially adapted to the theatre, the second
to the world, the third to the city." Who does not see to
which he gives the palm? Certainly to the second, which
he said above is that of the philosophers. For he testifies
that this pertains to the world, than which they think there
is nothing better. But those two theologies, the first and the
third,&mdash;to wit, those of the theatre and of the city,&mdash;has he
distinguished them or united them? For although we see
that the city is in the world, we do not see that it follows
that any things belonging to the city pertain to the world.
For it is possible that such things may be worshipped and
believed in the city, according to false opinions, as have no
existence either in the world or out of it. But where is the
theatre but in the city? Who instituted the theatre but the
state? For what purpose did it constitute it but for scenic
plays? And to what class of things do scenic plays belong
but to those divine things concerning which these books of
Varro's are written with so much ability?</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Concerning the mythic, that is, the fabulous, theology, and the civil,
against Varro.</i></p>

<p>O Marcus Varro! thou art the most acute, and without
doubt the most learned, but still a man, not God,&mdash;now lifted
up by the Spirit of God to see and to announce divine things,
thou seest, indeed, that divine things are to be separated from
human trifles and lies, but thou fearest to offend those most
corrupt opinions of the populace, and their customs in public
superstitions, which thou thyself, when thou considerest them
on all sides, perceivest, and all your literature loudly pronounces
to be abhorrent from the nature of the gods, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of such gods as the frailty of the human mind supposes to
exist in the elements of this world. What can the most
excellent human talent do here? What can human learning,
though manifold, avail thee in this perplexity? Thou
desirest to worship the natural gods; thou art compelled to
worship the civil. Thou hast found some of the gods to be
fabulous, on whom thou vomitest forth very freely what thou
thinkest, and, whether thou willest or not, thou wettest therewith
even the civil gods. Thou sayest, forsooth, that the
fabulous are adapted to the theatre, the natural to the world,
and the civil to the city; though the world is a divine work,
but cities and theatres are the works of men, and though the
gods who are laughed at in the theatre are not other than
those who are adored in the temples; and ye do not exhibit
games in honour of other gods than those to whom ye immolate
victims. How much more freely and more subtly
wouldst thou have decided these hadst thou said that some
gods are natural, others established by men; and concerning
those who have been so established, the literature of the poets
gives one account, and that of the priests another,&mdash;both of
which are, nevertheless, so friendly the one to the other,
through fellowship in falsehood, that they are both pleasing
to the demons, to whom the doctrine of the truth is hostile.</p>

<p>That theology, therefore, which they call natural, being
put aside for a moment, as it is afterwards to be discussed,
we ask if any one is really content to seek a hope for
eternal life from poetical, theatrical, scenic gods? Perish
the thought! The true God avert so wild and sacrilegious
a madness! What, is eternal life to be asked from those
gods whom these things pleased, and whom these things propitiate,
in which their own crimes are represented? No one,
as I think, has arrived at such a pitch of headlong and
furious impiety. So then, neither by the fabulous nor by
the civil theology does any one obtain eternal life. For the
one sows base things concerning the gods by feigning them,
the other reaps by cherishing them; the one scatters lies, the
other gathers them together; the one pursues divine things
with false crimes, the other incorporates among divine things
the plays which are made up of these crimes; the one sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
abroad in human songs impious fictions concerning the gods,
the other consecrates these for the festivities of the gods
themselves; the one sings the misdeeds and crimes of the
gods, the other loves them; the one gives forth or feigns, the
other either attests the true or delights in the false. Both
are base; both are damnable. But the one which is theatrical
teaches public abomination, and that one which is of the city
adorns itself with that abomination. Shall eternal life be
hoped for from these, by which this short and temporal life
is polluted? Does the society of wicked men pollute our life
if they insinuate themselves into our affections, and win our
assent? and does not the society of demons pollute the life,
who are worshipped with their own crimes?&mdash;if with true
crimes, how wicked the demons! if with false, how wicked
the worship!</p>

<p>When we say these things, it may perchance seem to some
one who is very ignorant of these matters that only those
things concerning the gods which are sung in the songs of
the poets and acted on the stage are unworthy of the divine
majesty, and ridiculous, and too detestable to be celebrated,
whilst those sacred things which not stage-players but priests
perform are pure and free from all unseemliness. Had this
been so, never would any one have thought that these theatrical
abominations should be celebrated in their honour, never
would the gods themselves have ordered them to be performed
to them. But men are in nowise ashamed to perform these
things in the theatres, because similar things are carried on
in the temples. In short, when the fore-mentioned author
attempted to distinguish the civil theology from the fabulous
and natural, as a sort of third and distinct kind, he wished it
to be understood to be rather tempered by both than separated
from either. For he says that those things which the poets
write are less than the people ought to follow, whilst what
the philosophers say is more than it is expedient for the people
to pry into. "Which," says he, "differ in such a way, that
nevertheless not a few things from both of them have been
taken to the account of the civil theology; wherefore we will
indicate what the civil theology has in common with that of
the poet, though it ought to be more closely connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the theology of philosophers." Civil theology is therefore not
quite disconnected from that of the poets. Nevertheless, in
another place, concerning the generations of the gods, he says
that the people are more inclined toward the poets than toward
the physical theologists. For in this place he said what ought
to be done; in that other place, what was really done. He
said that the latter had written for the sake of utility, but the
poets for the sake of amusement. And hence the things from
the poets' writings, which the people ought not to follow, are
the crimes of the gods; which, nevertheless, amuse both the
people and the gods. For, for amusement's sake, he says, the
poets write, and not for that of utility; nevertheless they write
such things as the gods will desire, and the people perform.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Concerning the likeness and agreement of the fabulous and civil theologies.</i></p>

<p>That theology, therefore, which is fabulous, theatrical, scenic,
and full of all baseness and unseemliness, is taken up into
the civil theology; and part of that theology, which in its
totality is deservedly judged to be worthy of reprobation and
rejection, is pronounced worthy to be cultivated and observed;&mdash;not
at all an incongruous part, as I have undertaken to
show, and one which, being alien to the whole body, was
unsuitably attached to and suspended from it, but a part
entirely congruous with, and most harmoniously fitted to
the rest, as a member of the same body. For what else
do those images, forms, ages, sexes, characteristics of the
gods show? If the poets have Jupiter with a beard, and
Mercury beardless, have not the priests the same? Is the
Priapus of the priests less obscene than the Priapus of the
players? Does he receive the adoration of worshippers in a
different form from that in which he moves about the stage
for the amusement of spectators? Is not Saturn old and
Apollo young in the shrines where their images stand, as well
as when represented by actor's masks? Why are Forculus,
who presides over doors, and Limentinus, who presides over
thresholds and lintels, male gods, and Cardea between them
feminine, who presides over hinges? Are not those things
found in books on divine things, which grave poets have
deemed unworthy of their verses? Does the Diana of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
theatre carry arms, whilst the Diana of the city is simply a
virgin? Is the stage Apollo a lyrist, but the Delphic Apollo
ignorant of this art? But these things are decent compared
with the more shameful things. What was thought of Jupiter
himself by those who placed his wet nurse in the Capitol?
Did they not bear witness to Euhemerus, who, not with the
garrulity of a fable-teller, but with the gravity of an historian
who had diligently investigated the matter, wrote that all such
gods had been men and mortals? And they who appointed
the Epulones as parasites at the table of Jupiter, what else did
they wish for but mimic sacred rites? For if any mimic had
said that parasites of Jupiter were made use of at his table,
he would assuredly have appeared to be seeking to call forth
laughter. Varro said it,&mdash;not when he was mocking, but when
he was commending the gods did he say it. His books on
divine, not on human, things testify that he wrote this,&mdash;not
where he set forth the scenic games, but where he explained
the Capitoline laws. In a word, he is conquered, and
confesses that, as they made the gods with a human form, so
they believed that they are delighted with human pleasures.</p>

<p>For also malign spirits were not so wanting to their own
business as not to confirm noxious opinions in the minds of
men by converting them into sport. Whence also is that
story about the sacristan of Hercules, which says that, having
nothing to do, he took to playing at dice as a pastime, throwing
them alternately with the one hand for Hercules, with the
other for himself, with this understanding, that if he should
win, he should from the funds of the temple prepare himself
a supper, and hire a mistress; but if Hercules should win
the game, he himself should, at his own expense, provide the
same for the pleasure of Hercules. Then, when he had been
beaten by himself, as though by Hercules, he gave to the god
Hercules the supper he owed him, and also the most noble
harlot Larentina. But she, having fallen asleep in the temple,
dreamed that Hercules had had intercourse with her, and had
said to her that she would find her payment with the youth
whom she should first meet on leaving the temple, and that
she was to believe this to be paid to her by Hercules. And
so the first youth that met her on going out was the wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Tarutius, who kept her a long time, and when he died left her
his heir. She, having obtained a most ample fortune, that she
should not seem ungrateful for the divine hire, in her turn
made the Roman people her heir, which she thought to be
most acceptable to the deities; and, having disappeared, the
will was found. By which meritorious conduct they say that
she gained divine honours.</p>

<p>Now had these things been feigned by the poets and acted
by the mimics, they would without any doubt have been said
to pertain to the fabulous theology, and would have been judged
worthy to be separated from the dignity of the civil theology.
But when these shameful things,&mdash;not of the poets, but of the
people; not of the mimics, but of the sacred things; not of
the theatres, but of the temples, that is, not of the fabulous,
but of the civil theology,&mdash;are reported by so great an author,
not in vain do the actors represent with theatrical art the
baseness of the gods, which is so great; but surely in vain do
the priests attempt, by rites called sacred, to represent their
nobleness of character, which has no existence. There are
sacred rites of Juno; and these are celebrated in her beloved
island, Samos, where she was given in marriage to Jupiter.
There are sacred rites of Ceres, in which Proserpine is sought
for, having been carried off by Pluto. There are sacred rites
Venus, in which, her beloved Adonis being slain by a boar's
tooth, the lovely youth is lamented. There are sacred rites of
the mother of the gods, in which the beautiful youth Atys,
loved by her, and castrated by her through a woman's jealousy,
is deplored by men who have suffered the like calamity, whom
they call Galli. Since, then, these things are more unseemly
than all scenic abomination, why is it that they strive to
separate, as it were, the fabulous fictions of the poet concerning
the gods, as, forsooth, pertaining to the theatre, from the
civil theology which they wish to belong to the city, as though
they were separating from noble and worthy things, things unworthy
and base? Wherefore there is more reason to thank
the stage-actors, who have spared the eyes of men, and have
not laid bare by theatrical exhibition all the things which are
hid by the walls of the temples. What good is to be thought
of their sacred rites which are concealed in darkness, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
those which are brought forth into the light are so detestable?
And certainly they themselves have seen what they transact
in secret through the agency of mutilated and effeminate men.
Yet they have <i>not</i> been able to conceal those same men miserably
and vilely enervated and corrupted. Let them persuade
whom they can that they transact anything holy through such
men, who, they cannot deny, are numbered, and live among
their sacred things. We know not what they transact, but
we know through whom they transact; for we know what
things are transacted on the stage, where never, even in a
chorus of harlots, hath one who is mutilated or an effeminate
appeared. And, nevertheless, even these things are acted by
vile and infamous characters; for, indeed, they ought not to
be acted by men of good character. What, then, are those
sacred rites, for the performance of which holiness has chosen
such men as not even the obscenity of the stage has admitted?</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Concerning the interpretations, consisting of natural explanations, which the
pagan teachers attempt to show for their gods.</i></p>

<p>But all these things, they say, have certain physical, that
is, natural interpretations, showing their natural meaning;
as though in this disputation we were seeking physics and
not theology, which is the account, not of nature, but of God.
For although He who is the true God is God, not by opinion,
but by nature, nevertheless all nature is not God; for there
is certainly a nature of man, of a beast, of a tree, of a stone,&mdash;none
of which is God. For if, when the question is concerning
the mother of the gods, that from which the whole
system of interpretation starts certainly is, that the mother of
the gods is the earth, why do we make further inquiry? why
do we carry our investigation through all the rest of it?
What can more manifestly favour them who say that all those
gods were men? For they are earth-born in the sense that
the earth is their mother. But in the true theology the earth
is the work, not the mother, of God. But in whatever way
their sacred rites may be interpreted, and, whatever reference
they may have to the nature of things, it is not according to
nature, but contrary to nature, that men should be effeminates.
This disease, this crime, this abomination, has a recognised
place among those sacred things, though even depraved men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
will scarcely be compelled by torments to confess they are
guilty of it. Again, if these sacred rites, which are proved to
be fouler than scenic abominations, are excused and justified
on the ground that they have their own interpretations, by
which they are shown to symbolize the nature of things, why
are not the poetical things in like manner excused and justified?
For many have interpreted even these in like fashion, to such
a degree that even that which they say is the most monstrous
and most horrible,&mdash;namely, that Saturn devoured his own
children,&mdash;has been interpreted by some of them to mean
that length of time, which is signified by the name of Saturn,
consumes whatever it begets; or that, as the same Varro
thinks, Saturn belongs to seeds which fall back again into the
earth from whence they spring. And so one interprets it in
one way, and one in another. And the same is to be said
of all the rest of this theology.</p>

<p>And, nevertheless, it is called the fabulous theology, and is
censured, cast off, rejected, together with all such interpretations
belonging to it. And not only by the natural theology,
which is that of the philosophers, but also by this civil theology,
concerning which we are speaking, which is asserted to pertain
to cities and peoples, it is judged worthy of repudiation, because
it has invented unworthy things concerning the gods.
Of which, I wot, this is the secret: that those most acute and
learned men, by whom those things were written, understood
that both theologies ought to be rejected,&mdash;to wit, both that
fabulous and this civil one,&mdash;but the former they dared to
reject, the latter they dared not; the former they set forth to
be censured, the latter they showed to be very like it; not that
it might be chosen to be held in preference to the other,
but that it might be understood to be worthy of being rejected
together with it. And thus, without danger to those who
feared to censure the civil theology, both of them being brought
into contempt, that theology which they call natural might
find a place in better disposed minds; for the civil and the
fabulous are both fabulous and both civil. He who shall
wisely inspect the vanities and obscenities of both will find
that they are both fabulous; and he who shall direct his
attention to the scenic plays pertaining to the fabulous theology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
in the festivals of the civil gods, and in the divine rites
of the cities, will find they are both civil. How, then, can
the power of giving eternal life be attributed to any of those
gods whose own images and sacred rites convict them of being
most like to the fabulous gods, which are most openly reprobated,
in forms, ages, sex, characteristics, marriages, generations,
rites; in all which things they are understood either to have
been men, and to have had their sacred rites and solemnities
instituted in their honour according to the life or death of
each of them, the demons suggesting and confirming this error,
or certainly most foul spirits, who, taking advantage of some
occasion or other, have stolen into the minds of men to deceive
them?</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Concerning the special offices of the gods.</i></p>

<p>And as to those very offices of the gods, so meanly and so
minutely portioned out, so that they say that they ought to be
supplicated, each one according to his special function,&mdash;about
which we have spoken much already, though not all that is to
be said concerning it,&mdash;are they not more consistent with
mimic buffoonery than divine majesty? If any one should
use two nurses for his infant, one of whom should give nothing
but food, the other nothing but drink, as these make use of
two goddesses for this purpose, Educa and Potina, he should
certainly seem to be foolish, and to do in his house a thing
worthy of a mimic. They would have Liber to have been
named from "liberation," because through him males at the
time of copulation are liberated by the emission of the seed.
They also say that Libera (the same in their opinion as Venus)
exercises the same function in the case of women, because they
say that they also emit seed; and they also say that on this
account the same part of the male and of the female is placed
in the temple, that of the male to Liber, and that of the female
to Libera. To these things they add the women assigned to
Liber, and the wine for exciting lust. Thus the Bacchanalia
are celebrated with the utmost insanity, with respect to which
Varro himself confesses that such things would not be done
by the Bacchanals except their minds were highly excited.
These things, however, afterwards displeased a saner senate,
and it ordered them to be discontinued. Here, at length, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
perhaps perceived how much power unclean spirits, when held
to be gods, exercise over the minds of men. These things,
certainly, were not to be done in the theatres; for there they
play, not rave, although to have gods who are delighted with
such plays is very like raving.</p>

<p>But what kind of distinction is this which he makes between
the religious and the superstitious man, saying that the gods
are feared<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> by the superstitious man, but are reverenced<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> as
parents by the religious man, not feared as enemies; and that
they are all so good that they will more readily spare those
who are impious than hurt one who is innocent? And yet he
tells us that three gods are assigned as guardians to a woman
after she has been delivered, lest the god Silvanus come in
and molest her; and that in order to signify the presence of
these protectors, three men go round the house during the night,
and first strike the threshold with a hatchet, next with a pestle,
and the third time sweep it with a brush, in order that these
symbols of agriculture having been exhibited, the god Silvanus
might be hindered from entering, because neither are trees cut
down or pruned without a hatchet, neither is grain ground
without a pestle, nor corn heaped up without a besom. Now
from these three things three gods have been named: Intercidona,
from the cut<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> made by the hatchet; Pilumnus, from the
pestle; Diverra, from the besom;&mdash;by which guardian gods the
woman who has been delivered is preserved against the power
of the god Silvanus. Thus the guardianship of kindly-disposed
gods would not avail against the malice of a mischievous god,
unless they were three to one, and fought against him, as it
were, with the opposing emblems of cultivation, who, being an
inhabitant of the woods, is rough, horrible, and uncultivated.
Is this the innocence of the gods? Is this their concord?
Are these the health-giving deities of the cities, more ridiculous
than the things which are laughed at in the theatres?</p>

<p>When a male and a female are united, the god Jugatinus presides.
Well, let this be borne with. But the married woman
must be brought home: the god Domiducus also is invoked.
That she may be in the house, the god Domitius is introduced.
That she may remain with her husband, the goddess Manturnæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
is used. What more is required? Let human modesty
be spared. Let the lust of flesh and blood go on with the
rest, the secret of shame being respected. Why is the bedchamber
filled with a crowd of deities, when even the groomsmen<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
have departed? And, moreover, it is so filled, not that
in consideration of their presence more regard may be paid to
chastity, but that by their help the woman, naturally of the
weaker sex, and trembling with the novelty of her situation,
may the more readily yield her virginity. For there are the
goddess Virginiensis, and the god-father Subigus, and the
goddess-mother Prema, and the goddess Pertunda, and Venus,
and Priapus.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> What is this? If it was absolutely necessary
that a man, labouring at this work, should be helped by the
gods, might not some one god or goddess have been sufficient?
Was Venus not sufficient alone, who is even said to be named
from this, that without her power a woman does not cease to
be a virgin? If there is any shame in men, which is not in
the deities, is it not the case that, when the married couple
believe that so many gods of either sex are present, and busy
at this work, they are so much affected with shame, that the
man is less moved, and the woman more reluctant? And
certainly, if the goddess Virginiensis is present to loose the
virgin's zone, if the god Subigus is present that the virgin
may be got under the man, if the goddess Prema is present
that, having been got under him, she may be kept down, and
may not move herself, what has the goddess Pertunda to do
there? Let her blush; let her go forth. Let the husband
himself do something. It is disgraceful that any one but himself
should do that from which she gets her name. But perhaps
she is tolerated because she is said to be a goddess, and
not a god. For if she were believed to be a male, and were
called Pertundus, the husband would demand more help against
him for the chastity of his wife than the newly-delivered
woman against Silvanus. But why am I saying this, when
Priapus, too, is there, a male to excess, upon whose immense
and most unsightly member the newly-married bride is commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
to sit, according to the most honourable and most
religious custom of matrons?</p>

<p>Let them go on, and let them attempt with all the subtlety
they can to distinguish the civil theology from the fabulous,
the cities from the theatres, the temples from the stages, the
sacred things of the priests from the songs of the poets,
as honourable things from base things, truthful things from
fallacious, grave from light, serious from ludicrous, desirable
things from things to be rejected, we understand what they
do. They are aware that that theatrical and fabulous theology
hangs by the civil, and is reflected back upon it from the songs
of the poets as from a mirror; and thus, that theology having
been exposed to view which they do not dare to condemn, they
more freely assail and censure that picture of it, in order that
those who perceive what they mean may detest this very face
itself of which that is the picture,&mdash;which, however, the gods
themselves, as though seeing themselves in the same mirror,
love so much, that it is better seen in both of them who and
what they are. Whence, also, they have compelled their worshippers,
with terrible commands, to dedicate to them the uncleanness
of the fabulous theology, to put them among their
solemnities, and reckon them among divine things; and thus
they have both shown themselves more manifestly to be most
impure spirits, and have made that rejected and reprobated
theatrical theology a member and a part of this, as it were,
chosen and approved theology of the city, so that, though the
whole is disgraceful and false, and contains in it fictitious
gods, one part of it is in the literature of the priests, the other
in the songs of the poets. Whether it may have other parts
is another question. At present, I think, I have sufficiently
shown, on account of the division of Varro, that the theology
of the city and that of the theatre belong to one civil theology.
Wherefore, because they are both equally disgraceful, absurd,
shameful, false, far be it from religious men to hope for eternal
life from either the one or the other.</p>

<p>In fine, even Varro himself, in his account and enumeration
of the gods, starts from the moment of a man's conception.
He commences the series of those gods who take charge of
man with Janus, carries it on to the death of the man decrepit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
with age, and terminates it with the goddess Nænia,
who is sung at the funerals of the aged. After that, he begins
to give an account of the other gods, whose province is not
man himself, but man's belongings, as food, clothing, and all
that is necessary for this life; and, in the case of all these,
he explains what is the special office of each, and for what
each ought to be supplicated. But with all this scrupulous
and comprehensive diligence, he has neither proved the existence,
nor so much as mentioned the name, of any god from
whom eternal life is to be sought,&mdash;the one object for which
we are Christians. Who, then, is so stupid as not to perceive
that this man, by setting forth and opening up so diligently
the civil theology, and by exhibiting its likeness to that fabulous,
shameful, and disgraceful theology, and also by teaching
that that fabulous sort is also a part of this other, was labouring
to obtain a place in the minds of men for none but that
natural theology which he says pertains to philosophers, with
such subtlety that he censures the fabulous, and, not daring
openly to censure the civil, shows its censurable character by
simply exhibiting it; and thus, both being reprobated by the
judgment of men of right understanding, the natural alone remains
to be chosen? But concerning this in its own place, by
the help of the true God, we have to discuss more diligently.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Concerning the liberty of Seneca, who more vehemently censured the civil
theology than Varro did the fabulous.</i></p>

<p>That liberty, in truth, which this man wanted, so that
he did not dare to censure that theology of the city, which
is very similar to the theatrical, so openly as he did the
theatrical itself, was, though not fully, yet in part possessed
by Annæus Seneca, whom we have some evidence to show to
have flourished in the times of our apostles. It was in part
possessed by him, I say, for he possessed it in writing, but
not in living. For in that book which he wrote against
superstition,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> he more copiously and vehemently censured
that civil and urban theology than Varro the theatrical and
fabulous. For, when speaking concerning images, he says,
"They dedicate images of the sacred and inviolable immortals
in most worthless and motionless matter. They give them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the appearance of man, beasts, and fishes, and some make
them of mixed sex, and heterogeneous bodies. They call
them deities, when they are such that if they should get
breath and should suddenly meet them, they would be held
to be monsters." Then, a while afterwards, when extolling
the natural theology, he had expounded the sentiments of
certain philosophers, he opposes to himself a question, and
says, "Here some one says, Shall I believe that the heavens
and the earth are gods, and that some are above the moon
and some below it? Shall I bring forward either Plato or the
peripatetic Strato, one of whom made God to be without a
body, the other without a mind?" In answer to which he
says, "And, really, what truer do the dreams of Titus Tatius,
or Romulus, or Tullus Hostilius appear to thee? Tatius declared
the divinity of the goddess Cloacina; Romulus that of
Picus and Tiberinus; Tullus Hostilius that of Pavor and Pallor,
the most disagreeable affections of men, the one of which
is the agitation of the mind under fright, the other that of the
body, not a disease, indeed, but a change of colour." Wilt
thou rather believe that these are deities, and receive them
into heaven? But with what freedom he has written concerning
the rites themselves, cruel and shameful! "One,"
he says, "castrates himself, another cuts his arms. Where
will they find room for the fear of these gods when angry,
who use such means of gaining their favour when propitious?
But gods who wish to be worshipped in this fashion should
be worshipped in none. So great is the frenzy of the mind
when perturbed and driven from its seat, that the gods are
propitiated by men in a manner in which not even men of
the greatest ferocity and fable-renowned cruelty vent their
rage. Tyrants have lacerated the limbs of some; they never
ordered any one to lacerate his own. For the gratification of
royal lust, some have been castrated; but no one ever, by
the command of his lord, laid violent hands on himself to
emasculate himself. They kill themselves in the temples.
They supplicate with their wounds and with their blood. If
any one has time to see the things they do and the things
they suffer, he will find so many things unseemly for men of
respectability, so unworthy of freemen, so unlike the doings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
of sane men, that no one would doubt that they are mad, had
they been mad with the minority; but now the multitude of
the insane is the defence of their sanity."</p>

<p>He next relates those things which are wont to be done
in the Capitol, and with the utmost intrepidity insists that
they are such things as one could only believe to be done
by men making sport, or by madmen. For, having spoken
with derision of this, that in the Egyptian sacred rites Osiris,
being lost, is lamented for, but straightway, when found, is
the occasion of great joy by his reappearance, because both
the losing and the finding of him are feigned; and yet that
grief and that joy which are elicited thereby from those who
have lost nothing and found nothing are real;&mdash;having, I say,
so spoken of this, he says, "Still there is a fixed time for
this frenzy. It is tolerable to go mad once in the year. Go
into the Capitol. One is suggesting divine commands<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> to a
god; another is telling the hours to Jupiter; one is a lictor;
another is an anointer, who with the mere movement of his
arms imitates one anointing. There are women who arrange
the hair of Juno and Minerva, standing far away not only
from her image, but even from her temple. These move their
fingers in the manner of hair-dressers. There are some women
who hold a mirror. There are some who are calling the gods
to assist them in court. There are some who are holding up
documents to them, and are explaining to them their cases.
A learned and distinguished comedian, now old and decrepit,
was daily playing the mimic in the Capitol, as though the gods
would gladly be spectators of that which men had ceased to
care about. Every kind of artificers working for the immortal
gods is dwelling there in idleness." And a little after he says,
"Nevertheless these, though they give themselves up to the
gods for purposes superfluous enough, do not do so for any
abominable or infamous purpose. There sit certain women in
the Capitol who think they are beloved by Jupiter; nor are
they frightened even by the look of the, if you will believe
the poets, most wrathful Juno."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>
<p>This liberty Varro did not enjoy. It was only the poetical
theology he seemed to censure. The civil, which this man
cuts to pieces, he was not bold enough to impugn. But if we
attend to the truth, the temples where these things are performed
are far worse than the theatres where they are represented.
Whence, with respect to these sacred rites of the
civil theology, Seneca preferred, as the best course to be followed
by a wise man, to feign respect for them in act, but to
have no real regard for them at heart. "All which things,"
he says, "a wise man will observe as being commanded by
the laws, but not as being pleasing to the gods." And a little
after he says, "And what of this, that we unite the gods in
marriage, and that not even naturally, for we join brothers
and sisters? We marry Bellona to Mars, Venus to Vulcan,
Salacia to Neptune. Some of them we leave unmarried, as
though there were no match for them, which is surely needless,
especially when there are certain unmarried goddesses,
as Populonia, or Fulgora, or the goddess Rumina, for whom
I am not astonished that suitors have been awanting. All
this ignoble crowd of gods, which the superstition of ages has
amassed, we ought," he says, "to adore in such a way as to remember
all the while that its worship belongs rather to custom
than to reality." Wherefore, neither those laws nor customs
instituted in the civil theology that which was pleasing to the
gods, or which pertained to reality. But this man, whom
philosophy had made, as it were, free, nevertheless, because
he was an illustrious senator of the Roman people, worshipped
what he censured, did what he condemned, adored
what he reproached, because, forsooth, philosophy had taught
him something great,&mdash;namely, not to be superstitious in the
world, but, on account of the laws of cities and the customs
of men, to be an actor, not on the stage, but in the temples,&mdash;conduct
the more to be condemned, that those things which
he was deceitfully acting he so acted that the people thought
he was acting sincerely. But a stage-actor would rather
delight people by acting plays than take them in by false
pretences.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>What Seneca thought concerning the Jews.</i></p>

<p>Seneca, among the other superstitions of civil theology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
also found fault with the sacred things of the Jews, and
especially the sabbaths, affirming that they act uselessly in
keeping those seventh days, whereby they lose through idleness
about the seventh part of their life, and also many
things which demand immediate attention are damaged. The
Christians, however, who were already most hostile to the
Jews, he did not dare to mention, either for praise or blame,
lest, if he praised them, he should do so against the ancient
custom of his country, or, perhaps, if he should blame them,
he should do so against his own will.</p>

<p>When he was speaking concerning those Jews, he said,
"When, meanwhile, the customs of that most accursed nation
have gained such strength that they have been now received in
all lands, the conquered have given laws to the conquerors."
By these words he expresses his astonishment; and, not knowing
what the providence of God was leading him to say, subjoins
in plain words an opinion by which he showed what
he thought about the meaning of those sacred institutions:
"For," he says, "those, however, know the cause of their rites,
whilst the greater part of the people know not why they perform
theirs." But concerning the solemnities of the Jews,
either why or how far they were instituted by divine authority,
and afterwards, in due time, by the same authority taken
away from the people of God, to whom the mystery of eternal
life was revealed, we have both spoken elsewhere, especially
when we were treating against the Manichæans, and also intend
to speak in this work in a more suitable place.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>12. <i>That when once the vanity of the gods of the nations has been exposed, it
cannot be doubted that they are unable to bestow eternal life on any one,
when they cannot afford help even with respect to the things of this temporal
life.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, since there are three theologies, which the Greeks
call respectively mythical, physical, and political, and which
may be called in Latin fabulous, natural, and civil; and since
neither from the fabulous, which even the worshippers of
many and false gods have themselves most freely censured,
nor from the civil, of which that is convicted of being a part,
or even worse than it, can eternal life be hoped for from any
of these theologies,&mdash;if any one thinks that what has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
said in this book is not enough for him, let him also add to
it the many and various dissertations concerning God as the
giver of felicity, contained in the former books, especially the
fourth one.</p>

<p>For to what but to felicity should men consecrate themselves,
were felicity a goddess? However, as it is not a
goddess, but a gift of God, to what God but the giver of
happiness ought we to consecrate ourselves, who piously love
eternal life, in which there is true and full felicity? But I
think, from what has been said, no one ought to doubt that
none of those gods is the giver of happiness, who are worshipped
with such shame, and who, if they are not so worshipped,
are more shamefully enraged, and thus confess that
they are most foul spirits. Moreover, how can he give eternal
life who cannot give happiness? For we mean by eternal life
that life where there is endless happiness. For if the soul
live in eternal punishments, by which also those unclean
spirits shall be tormented, that is rather eternal death than
eternal life. For there is no greater or worse death than
when death never dies. But because the soul from its very
nature, being created immortal, cannot be without some kind
of life, its utmost death is alienation from the life of God in
an eternity of punishment. So, then, He only who gives true
happiness gives eternal life, that is, an endlessly happy life.
And since those gods whom this civil theology worships have
been proved to be unable to give this happiness, they ought
not to be worshipped on account of those temporal and terrestrial
things, as we showed in the five former books, much less
on account of eternal life, which is to be after death, as
we have sought to show in this one book especially, whilst
the other books also lend it their co-operation. But since the
strength of inveterate habit has its roots very deep, if any one
thinks that I have not disputed sufficiently to show that this
civil theology ought to be rejected and shunned, let him attend
to another book which, with God's help, is to be joined to this
one.</p>

<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>It will be the duty of those who are endowed with quicker
and better understandings, in whose case the former books
are sufficient, and more than sufficient, to effect their intended
object, to bear with me with patience and equanimity whilst
I attempt with more than ordinary diligence to tear up and
eradicate depraved and ancient opinions hostile to the truth
of piety, which the long-continued error of the human race
has fixed very deeply in unenlightened minds; co-operating
also in this, according to my little measure, with the grace of
Him who, being the true God, is able to accomplish it, and
on whose help I depend in my work; and, for the sake of
others, such should not deem superfluous what they feel to be
no longer necessary for themselves. A very great matter is
at stake when the true and truly holy divinity is commended
to men as that which they ought to seek after and to worship;
not, however, on account of the transitory vapour of
mortal life, but on account of life eternal, which alone is
blessed, although the help necessary for this frail life we are
now living is also afforded us by it.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>Whether, since it is evident that Deity is not to be found in the civil theology,
we are to believe that it is to be found in the select gods.</i></p>

<p>If there is any one whom the sixth book, which I have last
finished, has not persuaded that this divinity, or, so to speak,
deity&mdash;for this word also our authors do not hesitate to use,
in order to translate more accurately that which the Greeks
call &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;;&mdash;if there is any one, I say, whom the sixth book
has not persuaded that this divinity or deity is not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
found in that theology which they call civil, and which
Marcus Varro has explained in sixteen books,&mdash;that is, that
the happiness of eternal life is not attainable through the
worship of gods such as states have established to be worshipped,
and that in such a form,&mdash;perhaps, when he has read
this book, he will not have anything further to desire in order
to the clearing up of this question. For it is possible that
some one may think that at least the select and chief gods,
whom Varro comprised in his last book, and of whom we have
not spoken sufficiently, are to be worshipped on account of
the blessed life, which is none other than eternal. In respect
to which matter I do not say what Tertullian said, perhaps
more wittily than truly, "If gods are selected like onions,
certainly the rest are rejected as bad."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> I do not say this,
for I see that even from among the select, some are selected
for some greater and more excellent office: as in warfare,
when recruits have been elected, there are some again elected
from among those for the performance of some greater military
service; and in the church, when persons are elected to be
overseers, certainly the rest are not rejected, since all good
Christians are deservedly called elect; in the erection of a
building corner stones are elected, though the other stones, which
are destined for other parts of the structure, are not rejected;
grapes are elected for eating, whilst the others, which we leave
for drinking, are not rejected. There is no need of adducing
many illustrations, since the thing is evident. Wherefore the
selection of certain gods from among many affords no proper
reason why either he who wrote on this subject, or the worshippers
of the gods, or the gods themselves, should be spurned.
We ought rather to seek to know what gods these are, and for
what purpose they may appear to have been selected.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Who are the select gods, and whether they are held to be exempt from the
offices of the commoner gods.</i></p>

<p>The following gods, certainly, Varro signalizes as select,
devoting one book to this subject: Janus, Jupiter, Saturn,
Genius, Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Vulcan, Neptune, Sol, Orcus,
father Liber, Tellus, Ceres, Juno, Luna, Diana, Minerva, Venus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Vesta; of which twenty gods, twelve are males, and eight
females. Whether are these deities called select, because of
their higher spheres of administration in the world, or because
they have become better known to the people, and more worship
has been expended on them? If it be on account of the
greater works which are performed by them in the world, we
ought not to have found them among that, as it were, plebeian
crowd of deities, which has assigned to it the charge of minute
and trifling things. For, first of all, at the conception of a
f&#339;tus, from which point all the works commence which have
been distributed in minute detail to many deities, Janus himself
opens the way for the reception of the seed; there also
is Saturn, on account of the seed itself; there is Liber,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> who
liberates the male by the effusion of the seed; there is Libera,
whom they also would have to be Venus, who confers this
same benefit on the woman, namely, that she also be liberated
by the emission of the seed;&mdash;all these are of the number
of those who are called select. But there is also the goddess
Mena, who presides over the menses; though the daughter
of Jupiter, ignoble nevertheless. And this province of the
menses the same author, in his book on the select gods, assigns
to Juno herself, who is even queen among the select gods; and
here, as Juno Lucina, along with the same Mena, her stepdaughter,
she presides over the same blood. There also are
two gods, exceedingly obscure, Vitumnus and Sentinus&mdash;the
one of whom imparts life to the f&#339;tus, and the other sensation;
and, of a truth, they bestow, most ignoble though they
be, far more than all those noble and select gods bestow. For,
surely, without life and sensation, what is the whole f&#339;tus
which a woman carries in her womb, but a most vile and
worthless thing, no better than slime and dust?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>3. <i>How there is no reason which can be shown for the selection of certain gods,
when the administration of more exalted offices is assigned to many inferior
gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What is the cause, therefore, which has driven so many
select gods to these very small works, in which they are
excelled by Vitumnus and Sentinus, though little known and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
sunk in obscurity, inasmuch as they confer the munificent
gifts of life and sensation? For the select Janus bestows an
entrance, and, as it were, a door<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> for the seed; the select
Saturn bestows the seed itself; the select Liber bestows on
men the emission of the same seed; Libera, who is Ceres or
Venus, confers the same on women; the select Juno confers
(not alone, but together with Mena, the daughter of Jupiter)
the menses, for the growth of that which has been conceived;
and the obscure and ignoble Vitumnus confers life, whilst the
obscure and ignoble Sentinus confers sensation;&mdash;which two
last things are as much more excellent than the others, as
they themselves are excelled by reason and intellect. For as
those things which reason and understand are preferable to
those which, without intellect and reason, as in the case of
cattle, live and feel; so also those things which have been
endowed with life and sensation are deservedly preferred to
those things which neither live nor feel. Therefore Vitumnus
the life-giver,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and Sentinus the sense-giver,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> ought to have
been reckoned among the select gods, rather than Janus the
admitter of seed, and Saturn the giver or sower of seed, and
Liber and Libera the movers and liberators of seed; which
seed is not worth a thought, unless it attain to life and sensation.
Yet these select gifts are not given by select gods, but
by certain unknown, and, considering their dignity, neglected
gods. But if it be replied that Janus has dominion over all
beginnings, and therefore the opening of the way for conception
is not without reason assigned to him; and that Saturn
has dominion over all seeds, and therefore the sowing of the
seed whereby a human being is generated cannot be excluded
from his operation; that Liber and Libera have power over the
emission of all seeds, and therefore preside over those seeds
which pertain to the procreation of men; that Juno presides
over all purgations and births, and therefore she has also
charge of the purgations of women and the births of human
beings;&mdash;if they give this reply, let them find an answer to
the question concerning Vitumnus and Sentinus, whether they
are willing that these likewise should have dominion over all
things which live and feel. If they grant this, let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
observe in how sublime a position they are about to place
them. For to spring from seeds is in the earth and of the
earth, but to live and feel are supposed to be properties even
of the sidereal gods. But if they say that only such things
as come to life in flesh, and are supported by senses, are
assigned to Sentinus, why does not that God who made all
things live and feel, bestow on flesh also life and sensation,
in the universality of His operation conferring also on f&#339;tuses
this gift? And what, then, is the use of Vitumnus and Sentinus?
But if these, as it were, extreme and lowest things
have been committed by Him who presides universally over
life and sense to these gods as to servants, are these select
gods then so destitute of servants, that they could not find any
to whom even they might commit those things, but with all
their dignity, for which they are, it seems, deemed worthy to
be selected, were compelled to perform their work along with
ignoble ones? Juno is select queen of the gods, and the
sister and wife of Jupiter; nevertheless she is Iterduca, the
conductor, to boys, and performs this work along with a most
ignoble pair&mdash;the goddesses Abeona and Adeona. There they
have also placed the goddess Mena, who gives to boys a good
mind, and she is not placed among the select gods; as if anything
greater could be bestowed on a man than a good mind.
But Juno is placed among the select because she is Iterduca
and Domiduca (she who conducts one on a journey, and
who conducts him home again); as if it is of any advantage
for one to make a journey, and to be conducted home again, if
his mind is not good. And yet the goddess who bestows that
gift has not been placed by the selectors among the select
gods, though she ought indeed to have been preferred even to
Minerva, to whom, in this minute distribution of work, they
have allotted the memory of boys. For who will doubt that
it is a far better thing to have a good mind, than ever so great
a memory? For no one is bad who has a good mind;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> but
some who are very bad are possessed of an admirable memory,
and are so much the worse, the less they are able to forget
the bad things which they think. And yet Minerva is among
the select gods, whilst the goddess Mena is hidden by a worthless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
crowd. What shall I say concerning Virtus? What concerning
Felicitas?&mdash;concerning whom I have already spoken
much in the fourth book,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> to whom, though they held them
to be goddesses, they have not thought fit to assign a place
among the select gods, among whom they have given a place
to Mars and Orcus, the one the causer of death, the other the
receiver of the dead.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, we see that even the select gods themselves
work together with the others, like a senate with the people,
in all those minute works which have been minutely portioned
out among many gods; and since we find that far greater and
better things are administered by certain gods who have not
been reckoned worthy to be selected than by those who are
called select, it remains that we suppose that they were called
select and chief, not on account of their holding more exalted
offices in the world, but because it happened to them to become
better known to the people. And even Varro himself says,
that in that way obscurity had fallen to the lot of some father
gods and mother goddesses,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> as it falls to the lot of men. If,
therefore, Felicity ought not perhaps to have been put among
the select gods, because they did not attain to that noble position
by merit, but by chance, Fortune at least should have been
placed among them, or rather before them; for they say that
that goddess distributes to every one the gifts she receives,
not according to any rational arrangement, but according as
chance may determine. She ought to have held the uppermost
place among the select gods, for among them chiefly it is that
she shows what power she has. For we see that they have
been selected not on account of some eminent virtue or rational
happiness, but by that random power of Fortune which the
worshippers of these gods think that she exerts. For that most
eloquent man Sallust also may perhaps have the gods themselves
in view when he says: "But, in truth, fortune rules in
everything; it renders all things famous or obscure, according
to caprice rather than according to truth."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> For they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
discover a reason why Venus should have been made famous,
whilst Virtus has been made obscure, when the divinity of both
of them has been solemnly recognised by them, and their merits
are not to be compared. Again, if she has deserved a noble
position on account of the fact that she is much sought after&mdash;for
there are more who seek after Venus than after Virtus&mdash;why
has Minerva been celebrated whilst Pecunia has been
left in obscurity, although throughout the whole human race
avarice allures a far greater number than skill? And even
among those who are skilled in the arts, you will rarely find
a man who does not practise his own art for the purpose of
pecuniary gain; and that for the sake of which anything is
made, is always valued more than that which is made for the
sake of something else. If, then, this selection of gods has
been made by the judgment of the foolish multitude, why has
not the goddess Pecunia been preferred to Minerva, since there
are many artificers for the sake of money? But if this distinction
has been made by the few wise, why has Virtus been
preferred to Venus, when reason by far prefers the former?
At all events, as I have already said, Fortune herself&mdash;who,
according to those who attribute most influence to her, renders
all things famous or obscure according to caprice rather than
according to the truth&mdash;since she has been able to exercise so
much power even over the gods, as, according to her capricious
judgment, to render those of them famous whom she would,
and those obscure whom she would; Fortune herself ought to
occupy the place of pre-eminence among the select gods, since
over them also she has such pre-eminent power. Or must
we suppose that the reason why she is not among the select
is simply this, that even Fortune herself has had an adverse
fortune? She was adverse, then, to herself, since, whilst ennobling
others, she herself has remained obscure.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>The inferior gods, whose names are not associated with infamy, have been better
dealt with than the select gods, whose infamies are celebrated.</i></p>

<p>However, any one who eagerly seeks for celebrity and renown,
might congratulate those select gods, and call them
fortunate, were it not that he saw that they have been selected
more to their injury than to their honour. For that low
crowd of gods have been protected by their very meanness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and obscurity from being overwhelmed with infamy. We
laugh, indeed, when we see them distributed by the mere
fiction of human opinions, according to the special works
assigned to them, like those who farm small portions of the
public revenue, or like workmen in the street of the silversmiths,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
where one vessel, in order that it may go out perfect,
passes through the hands of many, when it might have been
finished by one perfect workman. But the only reason why
the combined skill of many workmen was thought necessary,
was, that it is better that each part of an art should be learned
by a special workman, which can be done speedily and easily,
than that they should all be compelled to be perfect in one
art throughout all its parts, which they could only attain
slowly and with difficulty. Nevertheless there is scarcely to
be found one of the non-select gods who has brought infamy
on himself by any crime, whilst there is scarce any one of the
select gods who has not received upon himself the brand of
notable infamy. These latter have descended to the humble
works of the others, whilst the others have not come up to
their sublime crimes. Concerning Janus, there does not
readily occur to my recollection anything infamous; and
perhaps he was such an one as lived more innocently than
the rest, and further removed from misdeeds and crimes. He
kindly received and entertained Saturn when he was fleeing;
he divided his kingdom with his guest, so that each of them
had a city for himself,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>&mdash;the one Janiculum, and the other
Saturnia. But those seekers after every kind of unseemliness
in the worship of the gods have disgraced him, whose life they
found to be less disgraceful than that of the other gods, with an
image of monstrous deformity, making it sometimes with two
faces, and sometimes, as it were, double, with four faces.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Did
they wish that, as the most of the select gods had lost shame<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
through the perpetration of shameful crimes, his greater innocence
should be marked by a greater number of faces?<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">5. <i>Concerning the more secret doctrine of the pagans, and concerning the
physical interpretations.</i></p>

<p>But let us hear their own physical interpretations by which
they attempt to colour, as with the appearance of profounder
doctrine, the baseness of most miserable error. Varro, in the
first place, commends these interpretations so strongly as to say,
that the ancients invented the images, badges, and adornments
of the gods, in order that when those who went to the mysteries
should see them with their bodily eyes, they might with the eyes
of their mind see the soul of the world, and its parts, that is,
the true gods; and also that the meaning which was intended
by those who made their images with the human form, seemed
to be this,&mdash;namely, that the mind of mortals, which is in a
human body, is very like to the immortal mind,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> just as vessels
might be placed to represent the gods, as, for instance, a wine-vessel
might be placed in the temple of Liber, to signify wine,
that which is contained being signified by that which contains.
Thus by an image which had the human form the rational
soul was signified, because the human form is the vessel, as it
were, in which that nature is wont to be contained which they
attribute to God, or to the gods. These are the mysteries of
doctrine to which that most learned man penetrated in order
that he might bring them forth to the light. But, O thou
most acute man, hast thou lost among those mysteries that
prudence which led thee to form the sober opinion, that those
who first established those images for the people took away
fear from the citizens and added error, and that the ancient
Romans honoured the gods more chastely without images?
For it was through consideration of them that thou wast
emboldened to speak these things against the later Romans.
For if those most ancient Romans also had worshipped images,
perhaps thou wouldst have suppressed by the silence of fear
all those sentiments (true sentiments, nevertheless) concerning
the folly of setting up images, and wouldst have extolled more
loftily, and more loquaciously, those mysterious doctrines consisting
of these vain and pernicious fictions. Thy soul, so
learned and so clever (and for this I grieve much for thee),
could never through these mysteries have reached its God; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
is, the God by whom, not with whom, it was made, of whom
it is not a part, but a work,&mdash;that God who is not the soul of
all things, but who made every soul, and in whose light alone
every soul is blessed, if it be not ungrateful for His grace.</p>

<p>But the things which follow in this book will show what is
the nature of these mysteries, and what value is to be set upon
them. Meanwhile, this most learned man confesses as his
opinion that the soul of the world and its parts are the true
gods, from which we perceive that his theology (to wit, that
same natural theology to which he pays great regard) has been
able, in its completeness, to extend itself even to the nature
of the rational soul. For in this book (concerning the select
gods) he says a very few things by anticipation concerning
the natural theology; and we shall see whether he has been
able in that book, by means of physical interpretations, to
refer to this natural theology that civil theology, concerning
which he wrote last when treating of the select gods. Now,
if he has been able to do this, the whole is natural; and
in that case, what need was there for distinguishing so carefully
the civil from the natural? But if it has been distinguished
by a veritable distinction, then, since not even this
natural theology with which he is so much pleased is true (for
though it has reached as far as the soul, it has not reached to
the true God who made the soul), how much more contemptible
and false is that civil theology which is chiefly occupied
about what is corporeal, as will be shown by its very interpretations,
which they have with such diligence sought out and
enucleated, some of which I must necessarily mention!</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Concerning the opinion of Varro, that God is the soul of the world, which
nevertheless, in its various parts, has many souls whose nature is divine.</i></p>

<p>The same Varro, then, still speaking by anticipation, says
that he thinks that God is the soul of the world (which the
Greeks call &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;), and that this world itself is God; but as
a wise man, though he consists of body and mind, is nevertheless
called wise on account of his mind, so the world is called
God on account of mind, although it consists of mind and
body. Here he seems, in some fashion at least, to acknowledge
one God; but that he may introduce more, he adds that the
world is divided into two parts, heaven and earth, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
again divided each into two parts, heaven into ether and air,
earth into water and land, of all which the ether is the highest,
the air second, the water third, and the earth the lowest. All
these four parts, he says, are full of souls; those which are in
the ether and air being immortal, and those which are in the
water and on the earth mortal. From the highest part of the
heavens to the orbit of the moon there are souls, namely, the
stars and planets; and these are not only understood to be
gods, but are seen to be such. And between the orbit of the
moon and the commencement of the region of clouds and winds
there are aerial souls; but these are seen with the mind, not
with the eyes, and are called Heroes, and Lares, and Genii.
This is the natural theology which is briefly set forth in these
anticipatory statements, and which satisfied not Varro only, but
many philosophers besides. This I must discuss more carefully,
when, with the help of God, I shall have completed what
I have yet to say concerning the civil theology, as far as it
concerns the select gods.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Whether it is reasonable to separate Janus and Terminus as
two distinct deities.</i></p>

<p>Who, then, is Janus, with whom Varro commences? He
is the world. Certainly a very brief and unambiguous reply.
Why, then, do they say that the beginnings of things pertain
to him, but the ends to another whom they call Terminus?
For they say that two months have been dedicated to these
two gods, with reference to beginnings and ends&mdash;January to
Janus, and February to Terminus&mdash;over and above those ten
months which commence with March and end with December.
And they say that that is the reason why the Terminalia
are celebrated in the month of February, the same month
in which the sacred purification is made which they call
Februum, and from which the month derives its name.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
Do the beginnings of things, therefore, pertain to the world,
which is Janus, and not also the ends, since another god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
has been placed over them? Do they not own that all
things which they say begin in this world also come to an end
in this world? What folly it is, to give him only half power
in work, when in his image they give him two faces! Would
it not be a far more elegant way of interpreting the two-faced
image, to say that Janus and Terminus are the same, and that
the one face has reference to beginnings, the other to ends?
For one who works ought to have respect to both. For he
who in every forthputting of activity does not look back on
the beginning, does not look forward to the end. Wherefore
it is necessary that prospective intention be connected with
retrospective memory. For how shall one find how to finish
anything, if he has forgotten what it was which he had begun?
But if they thought that the blessed life is begun in this
world, and perfected beyond the world, and for that reason
attributed to Janus, that is, to the world, only the power of
beginnings, they should certainly have preferred Terminus to
him, and should not have shut him out from the number of
the select gods. Yet even now, when the beginnings and ends
of temporal things are represented by these two gods, more
honour ought to have been given to Terminus. For the greater
joy is that which is felt when anything is finished; but things
begun are always cause of much anxiety until they are brought
to an end, which end he who begins anything very greatly
longs for, fixes his mind on, expects, desires; nor does any one
ever rejoice over anything he has begun, unless it be brought
to an end.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>For what reason the worshippers of Janus have made his image with two
faces, when they would sometimes have it be seen with four.</i></p>

<p>But now let the interpretation of the two-faced image be
produced. For they say that it has two faces, one before and
one behind, because our gaping mouths seem to resemble the
world: whence the Greeks call the palate &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#8057;&#962;, and some
Latin poets,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> he says, have called the heavens palatum [the
palate]; and from the gaping mouth, they say, there is a way
out in the direction of the teeth, and a way in in the direction
of the gullet. See what the world has been brought to on
account of a Greek or a poetical word for our palate! Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
this god be worshipped only on account of saliva, which has
two open doorways under the heavens of the palate,&mdash;one
through which part of it may be spitten out, the other through
which part of it may be swallowed down. Besides, what is
more absurd than not to find in the world itself two doorways
opposite to each other, through which it may either receive
anything into itself, or cast it out from itself; and to seek of
our throat and gullet, to which the world has no resemblance,
to make up an image of the world in Janus, because the world
is said to resemble the <i>palate</i>, to which Janus bears no likeness?
But when they make him four-faced, and call him
double Janus, they interpret this as having reference to the
four quarters of the world, as though the world looked out on
anything, like Janus through his four faces. Again, if Janus
is the world, and the world consists of four quarters, then the
image of the two-faced Janus is false. Or if it is true, because
the whole world is sometimes understood by the expression east
and west, will any one call the world double when north and
south also are mentioned, as they call Janus double when he
has four faces? They have no way at all of interpreting, in
relation to the world, four doorways by which to go in and to
come out as they did in the case of the two-faced Janus, where
they found, at any rate in the human mouth, something
which answered to what they said about him; unless perhaps
Neptune come to their aid, and hand them a fish, which,
besides the mouth and gullet, has also the openings of the
gills, one on each side. Nevertheless, with all the doors, no
soul escapes this vanity but that one which hears the truth
saying, "I am the door."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Concerning the power of Jupiter, and a comparison of Jupiter with Janus.</i></p>

<p>But they also show whom they would have Jove (who is
also called Jupiter) understood to be. He is the god, say
they, who has the power of the causes by which anything
comes to be in the world. And how great a thing this is,
that most noble verse of Virgil testifies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Happy is he who has learned the causes of things."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>But why is Janus preferred to him? Let that most acute
and most learned man answer us this question. "Because,"
says he, "Janus has dominion over first things, Jupiter over
highest<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> things. Therefore Jupiter is deservedly held to be
the king of all things; for highest things are better than first
things: for although first things precede in time, highest
things excel by dignity."</p>

<p>Now this would have been rightly said had the first parts
of things which are done been distinguished from the highest
parts; as, for instance, it is the beginning of a thing done to
set out, the highest part to arrive. The commencing to learn
is the first part of a thing begun, the acquirement of knowledge
is the highest part. And so of all things: the beginnings
are first, the ends highest. This matter, however, has
been already discussed in connection with Janus and Terminus.
But the causes which are attributed to Jupiter are things effecting,
not things effected; and it is impossible for them to be
prevented in time by things which are made or done, or by
the beginnings of such things; for the thing which makes is
always prior to the thing which is made. Therefore, though
the beginnings of things which are made or done pertain to
Janus, they are nevertheless not prior to the efficient causes
which they attribute to Jupiter. For as nothing takes place
without being preceded by an efficient cause, so without an
efficient cause nothing begins to take place. Verily, if the
people call this god Jupiter, in whose power are all the causes
of all natures which have been made, and of all natural things,
and worship him with such insults and infamous criminations,
they are guilty of more shocking sacrilege than if they should
totally deny the existence of any god. It would therefore
be better for them to call some other god by the name of
Jupiter&mdash;some one worthy of base and criminal honours;
substituting instead of Jupiter some vain fiction (as Saturn is
said to have had a stone given to him to devour instead of his
son), which they might make the subject of their blasphemies,
rather than speak of <i>that</i> god as both thundering and committing
adultery,&mdash;ruling the whole world, and laying himself out
for the commission of so many licentious acts,&mdash;having in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
power nature and the highest causes of all natural things, but
not having his own causes good.</p>

<p>Next, I ask what place they find any longer for this Jupiter
among the gods, if Janus is the world; for Varro defined the
true gods to be the soul of the world, and the parts of it. And
therefore whatever falls not within this definition, is certainly
not a true god, according to them. Will they then say that
Jupiter is the soul of the world, and Janus the body&mdash;that is,
this visible world? If they say this, it will not be possible
for them to affirm that Janus is a god. For even, according
to them, the body of the world is not a god, but the soul of
the world and its parts. Wherefore Varro, seeing this, says
that he thinks God is the soul of the world, and that this
world itself is God; but that as a wise man, though he consists
of soul and body, is nevertheless called wise from the
soul, so the world is called God from the soul, though it
consists of soul and body. Therefore the body of the world
alone is not God, but either the soul of it alone, or the soul
and the body together, yet so as that it is God not by virtue
of the body, but by virtue of the soul. If, therefore, Janus
is the world, and Janus is a god, will they say, in order that
Jupiter may be a god, that he is some part of Janus? For
they are wont rather to attribute universal existence to
Jupiter; whence the saying, "All things are full of Jupiter."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
Therefore they must think Jupiter also, in order that he may
be a god, and especially king of the gods, to be the world, that
he may rule over the other gods&mdash;according to them, his parts.
To this effect, also, the same Varro expounds certain verses
of Valerius Soranus<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> in that book which he wrote apart from
the others concerning the worship of the gods. These are the
verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Almighty Jove, progenitor of kings, and things, and gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And eke the mother of the gods, god one and all."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But in the same book he expounds these verses by saying that
as the male emits seed, and the female receives it, so Jupiter,
whom they believed to be the world, both emits all seeds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
himself and receives them into himself. For which reason, he
says, Soranus wrote, "Jove, progenitor and mother;" and with
no less reason said that one and all were the same. For the
world is one, and in that one are all things.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Whether the distinction between Janus and Jupiter is a proper one.</i></p>

<p>Since, therefore, Janus is the world, and Jupiter is the world,
wherefore are Janus and Jupiter two gods, while the world is
but one? Why do they have separate temples, separate altars,
different rites, dissimilar images? If it be because the nature
of beginnings is one, and the nature of causes another, and the
one has received the name of Janus, the other of Jupiter; is
it then the case, that if one man has two distinct offices of
authority, or two arts, two judges or two artificers are spoken
of, because the nature of the offices or the arts is different?
So also with respect to one god: if he have the power of
beginnings and of causes, must he therefore be thought to be
two gods, because beginnings and causes are two things? But
if they think that this is right, let them also affirm that Jupiter
is as many gods as they have given him surnames, on account
of many powers; for the things from which these surnames
are applied to him are many and diverse. I shall mention a
few of them.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Concerning the surnames of Jupiter, which are referred not to many gods,
but to one and the same god.</i></p>

<p>They have called him Victor, Invictus, Opitulus, Impulsor,
Stator, Centumpeda, Supinalis, Tigillus, Almus, Ruminus, and
other names which it were long to enumerate. But these
surnames they have given to one god on account of diverse
causes and powers, but yet have not compelled him to be, on
account of so many things, as many gods. They gave him
these surnames because he conquered all things; because he
was conquered by none; because he brought help to the needy;
because he had the power of impelling, stopping, stablishing,
throwing on the back; because as a beam<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> he held together
and sustained the world; because he nourished all things;
because, like the pap,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> he nourished animals. Here, we perceive,
are some great things and some small things; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
it is one who is said to perform them all. I think that the
causes and the beginnings of things, on account of which they
have thought that the one world is two gods, Jupiter and
Janus, are nearer to each other than the holding together of
the world, and the giving of the pap to animals; and yet, on
account of these two works so far apart from each other, both
in nature and dignity, there has not been any necessity for
the existence of two gods; but one Jupiter has been called,
on account of the one Tigillus, on account of the other
Ruminus. I am unwilling to say that the giving of the pap
to sucking animals might have become Juno rather than
Jupiter, especially when there was the goddess Rumina to
help and to serve her in this work; for I think it may be
replied that Juno herself is nothing else than Jupiter, according
to those verses of Valerius Soranus, where it has been
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Almighty Jove, progenitor of kings, and things, and gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And eke the mother of the gods," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Why, then, was he called Ruminus, when they who may perchance
inquire more diligently may find that he is also that
goddess Rumina?</p>

<p>If, then, it was rightly thought unworthy of the majesty of
the gods, that in one ear of corn one god should have the care
of the joint, another that of the husk, how much more unworthy
of that majesty is it, that one thing, and that of the
lowest kind, even the giving of the pap to animals that they
may be nourished, should be under the care of two gods, one
of whom is Jupiter himself, the very king of all things, who
does this not along with his own wife, but with some ignoble
Rumina (unless perhaps he himself is Rumina, being Ruminus
for males and Rumina for females)! I should certainly have
said that they had been unwilling to apply to Jupiter a
feminine name, had he not been styled in these verses "progenitor
and mother," and had I not read among other surnames
of his that of Pecunia [money], which we found as a
goddess among those petty deities, as I have already mentioned
in the fourth book. But since both males and females have
money [<i>pecuniam</i>], why has he not been called both Pecunius
and Pecunia? That is their concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">12. <i>That Jupiter is also called Pecunia.</i></p>

<p>How elegantly they have accounted for this name! "He
is also called Pecunia," say they, "because all things belong
to him." Oh how grand an explanation of the name of a
deity! Yes; he to whom all things belong is most meanly
and most contumeliously called Pecunia. In comparison of all
things which are contained by heaven and earth, what are all
things together which are possessed by men under the name
of money?<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> And this name, forsooth, hath avarice given to
Jupiter, that whoever was a lover of money might seem to
himself to love not an ordinary god, but the very king of all
things himself. But it would be a far different thing if he had
been called Riches. For riches are one thing, money another.
For we call rich the wise, the just, the good, who have either
no money or very little. For they are more truly rich in
possessing virtue, since by it, even as respects things necessary
for the body, they are content with what they have. But we
call the greedy poor, who are always craving and always wanting.
For they may possess ever so great an amount of money;
but whatever be the abundance of that, they are not able
but to want. And we properly call God Himself rich; not,
however, in money, but in omnipotence. Therefore they who
have abundance of money are called rich, but inwardly needy
if they are greedy. So also, those who have no money are
called poor, but inwardly rich if they are wise.</p>

<p>What, then, ought the wise man to think of this theology,
in which the king of the gods receives the name of that thing
"which no wise man has desired?"<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> For had there been anything
wholesomely taught by this philosophy concerning eternal
life, how much more appropriately would that god who is the
ruler of the world have been called by them, not money, but
wisdom, the love of which purges from the filth of avarice, that
is, of the love of money!</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>That when it is expounded what Saturn is, what Genius is, it comes to
this, that both of them are shown to be Jupiter.</i></p>

<p>But why speak more of this Jupiter, with whom perchance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
all the rest are to be identified; so that, he being all, the
opinion as to the existence of many gods may remain as a
mere opinion, empty of all truth? And they are all to be
referred to him, if his various parts and powers are thought
of as so many gods, or if the principle of mind which they
think to be diffused through all things has received the names
of many gods from the various parts which the mass of this
visible world combines in itself, and from the manifold administration
of nature. For what is Saturn also? "One of the
principal gods," he says, "who has dominion over all sowings."
Does not the exposition of the verses of Valerius Soranus
teach that Jupiter is the world, and that he emits all seeds
from himself, and receives them into himself?</p>

<p>It is he, then, with whom is the dominion of all sowings.
What is Genius? "He is the god who is set over, and has
the power of begetting, all things." Who else than the world
do they believe to have this power, to which it has been said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Almighty Jove, progenitor and mother?"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when in another place he says that Genius is the
rational soul of every one, and therefore exists separately in
each individual, but that the corresponding soul of the world
is God, he just comes back to this same thing,&mdash;namely, that
the soul of the world itself is to be held to be, as it were, the
universal genius. This, therefore, is what he calls Jupiter.
For if every genius is a god, and the soul of every man a
genius, it follows that the soul of every man is a god. But if
very absurdity compels even these theologists themselves to
shrink from this, it remains that they call that genius god by
special and pre-eminent distinction, whom they call the soul
of the world, and therefore Jupiter.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Concerning the offices of Mercury and Mars.</i></p>

<p>But they have not found how to refer Mercury and Mars
to any parts of the world, and to the works of God which are
in the elements; and therefore they have set them at least
over human works, making them assistants in speaking and in
carrying on wars. Now Mercury, if he has also the power of
the speech of the gods, rules also over the king of the gods himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
if Jupiter, as he receives from him the faculty of speech,
also speaks according as it is his pleasure to permit him&mdash;which
surely is absurd; but if it is only the power over human
speech which is held to be attributed to him, then we say
it is incredible that Jupiter should have condescended to give
the pap not only to children, but also to beasts&mdash;from which
he has been surnamed Ruminus&mdash;and yet should have been
unwilling that the care of our speech, by which we excel the
beasts, should pertain to him. And thus speech itself both
belongs to Jupiter, and is Mercury. But if speech itself is
said to be Mercury, as those things which are said concerning
him by way of interpretation show it to be;&mdash;for he is said
to have been called Mercury, that is, he who runs between,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
because speech runs between men: they say also that the
Greeks call him &#7961;&#961;&#956;&#8134;&#962;, because speech, or interpretation, which
certainly belongs to speech, is called by them &#7953;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#8055;&#945;: also
he is said to preside over payments, because speech passes
between sellers and buyers: the wings, too, which he has on
his head and on his feet, they say, mean that speech passes
winged through the air: he is also said to have been called
the messenger,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> because by means of speech all our thoughts
are expressed;<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>&mdash;if, therefore, speech itself is Mercury, then,
even by their own confession, he is not a god. But when
they make to themselves gods of such as are not even demons,
by praying to unclean spirits, they are possessed by such as
are not gods, but demons. In like manner, because they have
not been able to find for Mars any element or part of the
world in which he might perform some works of nature of
whatever kind, they have said that he is the god of war,
which is a work of men, and that not one which is considered
desirable by them. If, therefore, Felicitas should give perpetual
peace, Mars would have nothing to do. But if war
itself is Mars, as speech is Mercury, I wish it were as true
that there were no war to be falsely called a god, as it is true
that it is not a god.</p>

<p class="center">15. <i>Concerning certain stars which the pagans have called by the names
of their gods.</i></p>

<p>But possibly these stars which have been called by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
names are these gods. For they call a certain star Mercury,
and likewise a certain other star Mars. But among those
stars which are called by the names of gods, is that one which
they call Jupiter, and yet with them Jupiter is the world.
There also is that one they call Saturn, and yet they give to
him no small property besides,&mdash;namely, all seeds. There also
is that brightest of them all which is called by them Venus,
and yet they will have this same Venus to be also the moon:&mdash;not
to mention how Venus and Juno are said by them to
contend about that most brilliant star, as though about another
golden apple. For some say that Lucifer belongs to Venus, and
some to Juno. But, as usual, Venus conquers. For by far the
greatest number assign that star to Venus, so much so that
there is scarcely found one of them who thinks otherwise.
But since they call Jupiter the king of all, who will not laugh to
see his star so far surpassed in brilliancy by the star of Venus?
For it ought to have been as much more brilliant than the
rest, as he himself is more powerful. They answer that it
only appears so because it is higher up, and very much farther
away from the earth. If, therefore, its greater dignity has
deserved a higher place, why is Saturn higher in the heavens
than Jupiter? Was the vanity of the fable which made
Jupiter king not able to reach the stars? And has Saturn
been permitted to obtain at least in the heavens, what he
could not obtain in his own kingdom nor in the Capitol?</p>

<p>But why has Janus received no star? If it is because he
is the world, and they are all in him, the world is also
Jupiter's, and yet he has one. Did Janus compromise his case
as best he could, and instead of the one star which he does
not have among the heavenly bodies, accept so many faces
on earth? Again, if they think that on account of the stars
alone Mercury and Mars are parts of the world, in order that
they may be able to have them for gods, since speech and
war are not parts of the world, but acts of men, how is it
that they have made no altars, established no rites, built
no temples for Aries, and Taurus, and Cancer, and Scorpio,
and the rest which they number as the celestial signs, and
which consist not of single stars, but each of them of many
stars, which also they say are situated above those already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
mentioned in the highest part of the heavens, where a more
constant motion causes the stars to follow an undeviating
course? And why have they not reckoned them as gods, I
do not say among those select gods, but not even among
those, as it were, plebeian gods?</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap16"></a>16. <i>Concerning Apollo and Diana, and the other select gods whom they would
have to be parts of the world.</i></p>

<p>Although they would have Apollo to be a diviner and
physician, they have nevertheless given him a place as some
part of the world. They have said that he is also the sun;
and likewise they have said that Diana, his sister, is the
moon, and the guardian of roads. Whence also they will
have her be a virgin, because a road brings forth nothing.
They also make both of them have arrows, because those
two planets send their rays from the heavens to the earth.
They make Vulcan to be the fire of the world; Neptune the
waters of the world; Father Dis, that is, Orcus, the earthy
and lowest part of the world. Liber and Ceres they set over
seeds,&mdash;the former over the seeds of males, the latter over
the seeds of females; or the one over the fluid part of seed,
but the other over the dry part. And all this together is
referred to the world, that is, to Jupiter, who is called "progenitor
and mother," because he emitted all seeds from himself,
and received them into himself. For they also make
this same Ceres to be the Great Mother, who they say is
none other than the earth, and call her also Juno. And
therefore they assign to her the second causes of things,
notwithstanding that it has been said to Jupiter, "progenitor
and mother of the gods;" because, according to them, the
whole world itself is Jupiter's. Minerva, also, because they
set her over human arts, and did not find even a star in
which to place her, has been said by them to be either the
highest æther, or even the moon. Also Vesta herself they
have thought to be the highest of the goddesses, because she
is the earth; although they have thought that the milder
fire of the world, which is used for the ordinary purposes
of human life, not the more violent fire, such as belongs to
Vulcan, is to be assigned to her. And thus they will have
all those select gods to be the world and its parts,&mdash;some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
them the whole world, others of them its parts; the whole
of it Jupiter,&mdash;its parts, Genius, Mater Magna, Sol and Luna,
or rather Apollo and Diana, and so on. And sometimes they
make one god many things; sometimes one thing many gods.
Many things are one god in the case of Jupiter; for both the
whole world is Jupiter, and the sky alone is Jupiter, and the
star alone is said and held to be Jupiter. Juno also is mistress
of second causes,&mdash;Juno is the air, Juno is the earth;
and had she won it over Venus, Juno would have been the
star. Likewise Minerva is the highest æther, and Minerva
is likewise the moon, which they suppose to be in the lowest
limit of the æther. And also they make one thing many
gods in this way. The world is both Janus and Jupiter;
also the earth is Juno, and Mater Magna, and Ceres.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>That even Varro himself pronounced his own opinions regarding the gods
ambiguous.</i></p>

<p>And the same is true with respect to all the rest, as is true
with respect to those things which I have mentioned for the
sake of example. They do not explain them, but rather
involve them. They rush hither and thither, to this side or
to that, according as they are driven by the impulse of erratic
opinion; so that even Varro himself has chosen rather to
doubt concerning all things, than to affirm anything. For,
having written the first of the three last books concerning
the certain gods, and having commenced in the second of
these to speak of the uncertain gods, he says: "I ought not
to be censured for having stated in this book the doubtful
opinions concerning the gods. For he who, when he has
read them, shall think that they both ought to be, and can be,
conclusively judged of, will do so himself. For my own part,
I can be more easily led to doubt the things which I have
written in the first book, than to attempt to reduce all the
things I shall write in this one to any orderly system." Thus
he makes uncertain not only that book, concerning the uncertain
gods, but also that other concerning the certain gods.
Moreover, in that third book concerning the select gods, after
having exhibited by anticipation as much of the natural theology
as he deemed necessary, and when about to commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
to speak of the vanities and lying insanities of the civil
theology, where he was not only without the guidance of the
truth of things, but was also pressed by the authority of
tradition, he says: "I will write in this book concerning the
public gods of the Roman people, to whom they have dedicated
temples, and whom they have conspicuously distinguished
by many adornments; but, as Xenophon of Colophon
writes, I will state what I think, not what I am prepared
to maintain: it is for man to think those things, for God to
know them."</p>

<p>It is not, then, an account of things comprehended and
most certainly believed which he promised, when about to
write those things which were instituted by men. He only
timidly promises an account of things which are but the
subject of doubtful opinion. Nor, indeed, was it possible for
him to affirm with the same certainty that Janus was the
world, and such like things; or to discover with the same
certainty such things as how Jupiter was the son of Saturn,
while Saturn was made subject to him as king:&mdash;he could,
I say, neither affirm nor discover such things with the
same certainty with which he knew such things as that the
world existed, that the heavens and earth existed, the heavens
bright with stars, and the earth fertile through seeds; or with
the same perfect conviction with which he believed that this
universal mass of nature is governed and administered by a
certain invisible and mighty force.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>A more credible cause of the rise of pagan error.</i></p>

<p>A far more credible account of these gods is given, when it
is said that they were men, and that to each one of them
sacred rites and solemnities were instituted, according to his
particular genius, manners, actions, circumstances; which
rites and solemnities, by gradually creeping through the souls
of men, which are like demons, and eager for things which
yield them sport, were spread far and wide; the poets adorning
them with lies, and false spirits seducing men to receive
them. For it is far more likely that some youth, either impious
himself, or afraid of being slain by an impious father,
being desirous to reign, dethroned his father, than that (according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to Varro's interpretation) Saturn was overthrown by
his son Jupiter; for cause, which belongs to Jupiter, is before
seed, which belongs to Saturn. For had this been so, Saturn
would never have been before Jupiter, nor would he have
been the father of Jupiter. For cause always precedes seed,
and is never generated from seed. But when they seek to
honour by natural interpretation most vain fables or deeds
of men, even the acutest men are so perplexed that we are
compelled to grieve for their folly also.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Concerning the interpretations which compose the reason of the worship
of Saturn.</i></p>

<p>They said, says Varro, that Saturn was wont to devour all
that sprang from him, because seeds returned to the earth
from whence they sprang. And when it is said that a lump
of earth was put before Saturn to be devoured instead of
Jupiter, it is signified, he says, that before the art of ploughing
was discovered, seeds were buried in the earth by the
hands of men. The earth itself, then, and not seeds, should
have been called Saturn, because it in a manner devours what
it has brought forth, when the seeds which have sprung from
it return again into it. And what has Saturn's receiving of
a lump of earth instead of Jupiter to do with this, that the
seeds were covered in the soil by the hands of men? Was
the seed kept from being devoured, like other things, by being
covered with the soil? For what they say would imply that
he who put on the soil took away the seed, as Jupiter is said
to have been taken away when the lump of soil was offered
to Saturn instead of him, and not rather that the soil, by
covering the seed, only caused it to be devoured the more
eagerly. Then, in that way, Jupiter is the seed, and not the
cause of the seed, as was said a little before.</p>

<p>But what shall men do who cannot find anything wise to
say, because they are interpreting foolish things? Saturn
has a pruning-knife. That, says Varro, is on account of
agriculture. Certainly in Saturn's reign there as yet existed
no agriculture, and therefore the former times of Saturn are
spoken of, because, as the same Varro interprets the fables,
the primeval men lived on those seeds which the earth produced
spontaneously. Perhaps he received a pruning-knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
when he had lost his sceptre; that he who had been a king,
and lived at ease during the first part of his time, should
become a laborious workman whilst his son occupied the
throne. Then he says that boys were wont to be immolated
to him by certain peoples, the Carthaginians for instance;
and also that adults were immolated by some nations, for
example the Gauls&mdash;because, of all seeds, the human race
is the best. What need we say more concerning this most
cruel vanity? Let us rather attend to and hold by this, that
these interpretations are not carried up to the true God,&mdash;a
living, incorporeal, unchangeable nature, from whom a blessed
life enduring for ever may be obtained,&mdash;but that they end
in things which are corporeal, temporal, mutable, and mortal.
And whereas it is said in the fables that Saturn castrated
his father C&#339;lus, this signifies, says Varro, that the divine
seed belongs to Saturn, and not to C&#339;lus; for this reason,
as far as a reason can be discovered, namely, that in heaven<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
nothing is born from seed. But, lo! Saturn, if he is the son
of C&#339;lus, is the son of Jupiter. For they affirm times without
number, and that emphatically, that the heavens<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> are
Jupiter. Thus those things which come not of the truth, do
very often, without being impelled by any one, themselves
overthrow one another. He says that Saturn was called
&#922;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;, which in the Greek tongue signifies a space of time,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
because, without that, seed cannot be productive. These and
many other things are said concerning Saturn, and they are
all referred to seed. But Saturn surely, with all that great
power, might have sufficed for seed. Why are other gods
demanded for it, especially Liber and Libera, that is, Ceres?&mdash;concerning
whom again, as far as seed is concerned, he
says as many things as if he had said nothing concerning
Saturn.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Concerning the rites of Eleusinian Ceres</i>.</p>

<p>Now among the rites of Ceres, those Eleusinian rites are
much famed which were in the highest repute among the
Athenians, of which Varro offers no interpretation except
with respect to corn, which Ceres discovered, and with respect
to Proserpine, whom Ceres lost, Orcus having carried her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
away. And this Proserpine herself, he says, signifies the
fecundity of seeds. But as this fecundity departed at a
certain season, whilst the earth wore an aspect of sorrow
through the consequent sterility, there arose an opinion that
the daughter of Ceres, that is, fecundity itself, who was called
Proserpine, from <i>proserpere</i> (to creep forth, to spring), had
been carried away by Orcus, and detained among the inhabitants
of the nether world; which circumstance was celebrated
with public mourning. But since the same fecundity again
returned, there arose joy because Proserpine had been given
back by Orcus, and thus these rites were instituted. Then
Varro adds, that many things are taught in the mysteries of
Ceres which only refer to the discovery of fruits.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Concerning the shamefulness of the rites which are celebrated in honour
of Liber</i>.</p>

<p>Now as to the rites of Liber, whom they have set over
liquid seeds, and therefore not only over the liquors of fruits,
among which wine holds, so to speak, the primacy, but also
over the seeds of animals:&mdash;as to these rites, I am unwilling
to undertake to show to what excess of turpitude they had
reached, because that would entail a lengthened discourse,
though I am not unwilling to do so as a demonstration of the
proud stupidity of those who practise them. Among other
rites which I am compelled from the greatness of their number
to omit, Varro says that in Italy, at the places where roads
crossed each other, the rites of Liber were celebrated with
such unrestrained turpitude, that the private parts of a man
were worshipped in his honour. Nor was this abomination
transacted in secret, that some regard at least might be paid
to modesty, but was openly and wantonly displayed. For
during the festival of Liber, this obscene member, placed on
a car, was carried with great honour, first over the cross-roads
in the country, and then into the city. But in the town of
Lavinium a whole month was devoted to Liber alone, during
the days of which all the people gave themselves up to the
most dissolute conversation, until that member had been
carried through the forum and brought to rest in its own
place; on which unseemly member it was necessary that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the most honourable matron should place a wreath in the
presence of all the people. Thus, forsooth, was the god Liber
to be appeased in order to the growth of seeds. Thus was
enchantment to be driven away from fields, even by a matron's
being compelled to do in public what not even a harlot ought
to be permitted to do in a theatre, if there were matrons
among the spectators. For these reasons, then, Saturn alone
was not believed to be sufficient for seeds,&mdash;namely, that the
impure mind might find occasions for multiplying the gods;
and that, being righteously abandoned to uncleanness by the
one true God, and being prostituted to the worship of many
false gods, through an avidity for ever greater and greater
uncleanness, it should call these sacrilegious rites sacred
things, and should abandon itself to be violated and polluted
by crowds of foul demons.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Concerning Neptune, and Salacia, and Venilia</i>.</p>

<p>Now Neptune had Salacia to wife, who they say is the
nether waters of the sea. Wherefore was Venilia also joined
to him? Was it not simply through the lust of the soul
desiring a greater number of demons to whom to prostitute
itself, and not because this goddess was necessary to the perfection
of their sacred rites? But let the interpretation of this
illustrious theology be brought forward to restrain us from
this censuring by rendering a satisfactory reason. Venilia,
says this theology, is the wave which comes to the shore,
Salacia the wave which returns into the sea. Why, then, are
there two goddesses, when it is one wave which comes and
returns? Certainly it is mad lust itself, which in its eagerness
for many deities resembles the waves which break on the
shore. For though the water which goes is not different from
that which returns, still the soul which goes and returns not
is defiled by two demons, whom it has taken occasion by this
false pretext to invite. I ask thee, O Varro, and you who
have read such works of learned men, and think ye have
learned something great,&mdash;I ask you to interpret this, I do not
say in a manner consistent with the eternal and unchangeable
nature which alone is God, but only in a manner consistent
with the doctrine concerning the soul of the world and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
parts, which ye think to be the true gods. It is a somewhat
more tolerable thing that ye have made that part of the soul
of the world which pervades the sea your god Neptune. Is
the wave, then, which comes to the shore and returns to the
main, two parts of the world, or two parts of the soul of the
world? Who of you is so silly as to think so? Why, then,
have they made to you two goddesses? The only reason
seems to be, that your wise ancestors have provided, not that
many gods should rule you, but that many of such demons as
are delighted with those vanities and falsehoods should possess
you. But why has that Salacia, according to this interpretation,
lost the lower part of the sea, seeing that she was represented
as subject to her husband? For in saying that she
is the receding wave, ye have put her on the surface. Was
she enraged at her husband for taking Venilia as a concubine,
and thus drove him from the upper part of the sea?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Concerning the earth, which Varro affirms to be a goddess, because that soul
of the world which he thinks to be God pervades also this lowest part of
his body, and imparts to it a divine force.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Surely the earth, which we see full of its own living creatures,
is one; but for all that, it is but a mighty mass among
the elements, and the lowest part of the world. Why, then,
would they have it to be a goddess? Is it because it is fruitful?
Why, then, are not men rather held to be gods, who
render it fruitful by cultivating it; but though they plough
it, do not adore it? But, say they, the part of the soul of the
world which pervades it makes it a goddess. As if it were
not a far more evident thing, nay, a thing which is not called
in question, that there is a soul in man. And yet men are
not held to be gods, but (a thing to be sadly lamented), with
wonderful and pitiful delusion, are subjected to those who are
not gods, and than whom they themselves are better, as the
objects of deserved worship and adoration. And certainly the
same Varro, in the book concerning the select gods, affirms
that there are three grades of soul in universal nature. One
which pervades all the living parts of the body, and has not
sensation, but only the power of life,&mdash;that principle which
penetrates into the bones, nails, and hair. By this principle
in the world trees are nourished, and grow without being possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
of sensation, and live in a manner peculiar to themselves.
The second grade of soul is that in which there is
sensation. This principle penetrates into the eyes, ears,
nostrils, mouth, and the organs of sensation. The third grade
of soul is the highest, and is called mind, where intelligence
has its throne. This grade of soul no mortal creatures except
man are possessed of. Now this part of the soul of the world,
Varro says, is called God, and in us is called Genius. And the
stones and earth in the world, which we see, and which are
not pervaded by the power of sensation, are, as it were, the
bones and nails of God. Again, the sun, moon, and stars,
which we perceive, and by which He perceives, are His organs
of perception. Moreover, the ether is His mind; and by the
virtue which is in it, which penetrates into the stars, it also
makes them gods; and because it penetrates through them
into the earth, it makes it the goddess Tellus, whence again it
enters and permeates the sea and ocean, making them the god
Neptune.</p>

<p>Let him return from this, which he thinks to be natural
theology, back to that from which he went out, in order
to rest from the fatigue occasioned by the many turnings and
windings of his path. Let him return, I say, let him return
to the civil theology. I wish to detain him there a
while. I have somewhat to say which has to do with that
theology. I am not yet saying, that if the earth and stones
are similar to our bones and nails, they are in like manner
devoid of intelligence, as they are devoid of sensation. Nor
am I saying that, if our bones and nails are said to have intelligence,
because they are in a man who has intelligence, he
who says that the things analogous to these in the world are
gods, is as stupid as he is who says that our bones and nails
are men. We shall perhaps have occasion to dispute these
things with the philosophers. At present, however, I wish to
deal with Varro as a political theologian. For it is possible
that, though he may seem to have wished to lift up his head,
as it were, into the liberty of natural theology, the consciousness
that the book with which he was occupied was one concerning
a subject belonging to civil theology, may have caused
him to relapse into the point of view of that theology, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
say this in order that the ancestors of his nation, and other
states, might not be believed to have bestowed on Neptune an
irrational worship. What I am to say is this: Since the earth
is one, why has not that part of the soul of the world which
permeates the earth made it that one goddess which he calls
Tellus? But had it done so, what then had become of Orcus,
the brother of Jupiter and Neptune, whom they call Father
Dis?<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> And where, in that case, had been his wife Proserpine,
who, according to another opinion given in the same book, is
called, not the fecundity of the earth, but its lower part?<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
But if they say that part of the soul of the world, when it
permeates the upper part of the earth, makes the god Father
Dis, but when it pervades the nether part of the same the
goddess Proserpine; what, in that case, will that Tellus be?
For all that which she was has been divided into these two
parts, and these two gods; so that it is impossible to find
what to make or where to place her as a third goddess, except
it be said that those divinities Orcus and Proserpine are the
one goddess Tellus, and that they are not three gods, but one
or two, whilst notwithstanding they are called three, held to
be three, worshipped as three, having their own several altars,
their own shrines, rites, images, priests, whilst their own false
demons also through these things defile the prostituted soul.
Let this further question be answered: What part of the earth
does a part of the soul of the world permeate in order to make
the god Tellumo? No, says he; but the earth being one and
the same, has a double life,&mdash;the masculine, which produces
seed, and the feminine, which receives and nourishes the seed.
Hence it has been called Tellus from the feminine principle,
and Tellumo from the masculine. Why, then, do the priests,
as he indicates, perform divine service to four gods, two others
being added,&mdash;namely, to Tellus, Tellumo, Altor, and Rusor?
We have already spoken concerning Tellus and Tellumo. But
why do they worship Altor?<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Because, says he, all that
springs of the earth is nourished by the earth. Wherefore
do they worship Rusor?<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Because all things return back
again to the place whence they proceeded.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>24. <i>Concerning the surnames of Tellus and their significations, which, although
they indicate many properties, ought not to have established the opinion
that there is a corresponding number of gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The one earth, then, on account of this fourfold virtue,
ought to have had four surnames, but not to have been considered
as four gods,&mdash;as Jupiter and Juno, though they have
so many surnames, are for all that only single deities,&mdash;for by
all these surnames it is signified that a manifold virtue belongs
to one god or to one goddess; but the multitude of surnames
does not imply a multitude of gods. But as sometimes
even the vilest women themselves grow tired of those crowds
which they have sought after under the impulse of wicked
passion, so also the soul, become vile, and prostituted to impure
spirits, sometimes begins to loathe to multiply to itself
gods to whom to surrender itself to be polluted by them, as
much as it once delighted in so doing. For Varro himself,
as if ashamed of that crowd of gods, would make Tellus to be
one goddess. "They say," says he, "that whereas the one
great mother has a tympanum, it is signified that she is the
orb of the earth; whereas she has towers on her head, towns
are signified; and whereas seats are fixed round about her, it
is signified that whilst all things move, she moves not. And
their having made the Galli to serve this goddess, signifies
that they who are in need of seed ought to follow the earth,
for in it all seeds are found. By their throwing themselves
down before her, it is taught," he says, "that they who cultivate
the earth should not sit idle, for there is always something
for them to do. The sound of the cymbals signifies the
noise made by the throwing of iron utensils, and by men's
hands, and all other noises connected with agricultural operations;
and these cymbals are of brass, because the ancients
used brazen utensils in their agriculture before iron was discovered.
They place beside the goddess an unbound and
tame lion, to show that there is no kind of land so wild and
so excessively barren as that it would be profitless to attempt
to bring it in and cultivate it." Then he adds that, because
they gave many names and surnames to mother Tellus, it
came to be thought that these signified many gods. "They
think," says he, "that Tellus is Ops, because the earth is improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
by labour; Mother, because it brings forth much;
Great, because it brings forth seed; Proserpine, because fruits
creep forth from it; Vesta, because it is invested with herbs.
And thus," says he, "they not at all absurdly identify other
goddesses with the earth." If, then, it is one goddess (though,
if the truth were consulted, it is not even that), why do they
nevertheless separate it into many? Let there be many
names of one goddess, and let there not be as many goddesses
as there are names.</p>

<p>But the authority of the erring ancients weighs heavily on
Varro, and compels him, after having expressed this opinion,
to show signs of uneasiness; for he immediately adds,
"With which things the opinion of the ancients, who thought
that there were really many goddesses, does not conflict."
How does it not conflict, when it is entirely a different thing
to say that one goddess has many names, and to say that
there are many goddesses? But it is possible, he says, that
the same thing may both be one, and yet have in it a plurality
of things. I grant that there are many things in one man;
are there therefore in him many men? In like manner, in
one goddess there are many things; are there therefore also
many goddesses? But let them divide, unite, multiply, reduplicate,
and implicate as they like.</p>

<p>These are the famous mysteries of Tellus and the Great
Mother, all of which are shown to have reference to mortal
seeds and to agriculture. Do these things, then,&mdash;namely,
the tympanum, the towers, the Galli, the tossing to and fro
of limbs, the noise of cymbals, the images of lions,&mdash;do these
things, having this reference and this end, promise eternal
life? Do the mutilated Galli, then, serve this Great Mother
in order to signify that they who are in need of seed should
follow the earth, as though it were not rather the case that
this very service caused them to want seed? For whether do
they, by following this goddess, acquire seed, being in want of
it, or, by following her, lose seed when they have it? Is this
to interpret or to deprecate? Nor is it considered to what a
degree malign demons have gained the upper hand, inasmuch
as they have been able to exact such cruel rites without having
dared to promise any great things in return for them. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the earth not been a goddess, men would have, by labouring,
laid their hands on <i>it</i> in order to obtain seed through it, and
would not have laid violent hands on themselves in order to
lose seed on account of it. Had it not been a goddess, it
would have become so fertile by the hands of others, that it
would not have compelled a man to be rendered barren by
his own hands; nor that in the festival of Liber an honourable
matron put a wreath on the private parts of a man in
the sight of the multitude, where perhaps her husband was
standing by blushing and perspiring, if there is any shame left
in men; and that in the celebration of marriages the newly-married
bride was ordered to sit upon Priapus. These things
are bad enough, but they are small and contemptible in comparison
with that most cruel abomination, or most abominable
cruelty, by which either set is so deluded that neither perishes
of its wound. There the enchantment of fields is feared; here
the amputation of members is not feared. There the modesty
of the bride is outraged, but in such a manner as that neither
her fruitfulness nor even her virginity is taken away; here
a man is so mutilated that he is neither changed into a woman
nor remains a man.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>The interpretation of the mutilation of Atys which the doctrine of the
Greek sages set forth.</i></p>

<p>Varro has not spoken of that Atys, nor sought out any
interpretation for him, in memory of whose being loved by
Ceres the Gallus is mutilated. But the learned and wise
Greeks have by no means been silent about an interpretation
so holy and so illustrious. The celebrated philosopher Porphyry
has said that Atys signifies the flowers of spring, which
is the most beautiful season, and therefore was mutilated
because the flower falls before the fruit appears.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> They
have not, then, compared the man himself, or rather that
semblance of a man they called Atys, to the flower, but his
male organs,&mdash;these, indeed, fell whilst he was living. Did
I say fell? nay, truly they did not fall, nor were they plucked
off, but torn away. Nor when that flower was lost did any
fruit follow, but rather sterility. What, then, do they say
is signified by the castrated Atys himself, and whatever remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
to him after his castration? To what do they refer
that? What interpretation does that give rise to? Do they,
after vain endeavours to discover an interpretation, seek to
persuade men that that is rather to be believed which report
has made public, and which has also been written concerning
his having been a mutilated man? Our Varro has very properly
opposed this, and has been unwilling to state it; for it
certainly was not unknown to that most learned man.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Concerning the abomination of the sacred rites of the Great Mother</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning the effeminates consecrated to the same Great
Mother, in defiance of all the modesty which belongs to men
and women, Varro has not wished to say anything, nor do I
remember to have read anywhere aught concerning them.
These effeminates, no later than yesterday, were going through
the streets and places of Carthage with anointed hair, whitened
faces, relaxed bodies, and feminine gait, exacting from the
people the means of maintaining their ignominious lives.
Nothing has been said concerning them. Interpretation
failed, reason blushed, speech was silent. The Great Mother
has surpassed all her sons, not in greatness of deity, but of
crime. To this monster not even the monstrosity of Janus is
to be compared. His deformity was only in his image; hers
was the deformity of cruelty in her sacred rites. He has a
redundancy of members in stone images; she inflicts the loss
of members on men. This abomination is not surpassed by
the licentious deeds of Jupiter, so many and so great. He,
with all his seductions of women, only disgraced heaven with
one Ganymede; she, with so many avowed and public effeminates,
has both defiled the earth and outraged heaven. Perhaps
we may either compare Saturn to this Magna Mater, or
even set him before her in this kind of abominable cruelty,
for he mutilated his father. But at the festivals of Saturn
men could rather be slain by the hands of others than mutilated
by their own. He devoured his sons, as the poets say,
and the natural theologists interpret this as they list. History
says he slew them. But the Romans never received,
like the Carthaginians, the custom of sacrificing their sons to
him. This Great Mother of the gods, however, has brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
mutilated men into Roman temples, and has preserved that
cruel custom, being believed to promote the strength of the
Romans by emasculating their men. Compared with this
evil, what are the thefts of Mercury, the wantonness of Venus,
and the base and flagitious deeds of the rest of them, which
we might bring forward from books, were it not that they are
daily sung and danced in the theatres? But what are these
things to so great an evil,&mdash;an evil whose magnitude was only
proportioned to the greatness of the Great Mother,&mdash;especially
as these are said to have been invented by the poets?
as if the poets had also invented this, that they are acceptable
to the gods. Let it be imputed, then, to the audacity
and impudence of the poets that these things have been sung
and written of. But that they have been incorporated into
the body of divine rites and honours, the deities themselves
demanding and extorting that incorporation, what is that but
the crime of the gods? nay more, the confession of demons
and the deception of wretched men? But as to this, that
the Great Mother is considered to be worshipped in the appropriate
form when she is worshipped by the consecration of
mutilated men, this is not an invention of the poets, nay,
they have rather shrunk from it with horror than sung of it.
Ought any one, then, to be consecrated to these select gods,
that he may live blessedly after death, consecrated to whom
he could not live decently before death, being subjected to such
foul superstitions, and bound over to unclean demons? But
all these things, says Varro, are to be referred to the world.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
Let him consider if it be not rather to the unclean.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But
why not refer that to the world which is demonstrated to be
in the world? We, however, seek for a mind which, trusting
to true religion, does not adore the world as its god, but for
the sake of God praises the world as a work of God, and,
purified from mundane defilements, comes pure<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> to God Himself

</div></div></div>

<p>and what follows with reference to this affair, is fully related
by the historian Euhemerus, and has been translated into
Latin by Ennius. And as they who have written before us
in the Greek or in the Latin tongue against such errors as
these have said much concerning this matter, I have thought
it unnecessary to dwell upon it. When I consider those physical
reasons, then, by which learned and acute men attempt to
turn human things into divine things, all I see is that they
have been able to refer these things only to temporal works
and to that which has a corporeal nature, and even though
invisible still mutable; and this is by no means the true God.
But if this worship had been performed as the symbolism of
ideas at least congruous with religion, though it would indeed
have been cause of grief that the true God was not announced
and proclaimed by its symbolism, nevertheless it could have
been in some degree borne with, when it did not occasion
and command the performance of such foul and abominable
things. But since it is impiety to worship the body or the
soul for the true God, by whose indwelling alone the soul is
happy, how much more impious is it to worship those things
through which neither soul nor body can obtain either salvation
or human honour? Wherefore if with temple, priest, and
sacrifice, which are due to the true God, any element of the
world be worshipped, or any created spirit, even though not
impure and evil, that worship is still evil, not because the
things are evil by which the worship is performed, but because
those things ought only to be used in the worship of Him to
whom alone such worship and service are due. But if any
one insist that he worships the one true God,&mdash;that is, the
Creator of every soul and of every body,&mdash;with stupid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
monstrous idols, with human victims, with putting a wreath
on the male organ, with the wages of unchastity, with the
cutting of limbs, with emasculation, with the consecration of
effeminates, with impure and obscene plays, such a one does
not sin because he worships One who ought not to be worshipped,
but because he worships Him who ought to be worshipped
in a way in which He ought not to be worshipped.
But he who worships with such things,&mdash;that is, foul and
obscene things,&mdash;and that not the true God, namely, the
maker of soul and body, but a creature, even though not a
wicked creature, whether it be soul or body, or soul and body
together, twice sins against God, because he both worships
for God what is not God, and also worships with such things
as neither God nor what is not God ought to be worshipped
with. It is, indeed, manifest how these pagans worship,&mdash;that
is, how shamefully and criminally they worship; but what or
whom they worship would have been left in obscurity, had
not their history testified that those same confessedly base
and foul rites were rendered in obedience to the demands of
the gods, who exacted them with terrible severity. Wherefore
it is evident beyond doubt that this whole civil theology is
occupied in inventing means for attracting wicked and most
impure spirits, inviting them to visit senseless images, and
through these to take possession of stupid hearts.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>That the doctrine of Varro concerning theology is in no part consistent
with itself</i>.</p>

<p>To what purpose, then, is it that this most learned and most
acute man Varro attempts, as it were, with subtle disputation,
to reduce and refer all these gods to heaven and earth? He
cannot do it. They go out of his hands like water; they
shrink back; they slip down and fall. For when about to
speak of the females, that is, the goddesses, he says, "Since,
as I observed in the first book concerning places, heaven and
earth are the two origins of the gods, on which account they
are called celestials and terrestrials, and as I began in the former
books with heaven, speaking of Janus, whom some have said
to be heaven, and others the earth, so I now commence with
Tellus in speaking concerning the goddesses." I can understand
what embarrassment so great a mind was experiencing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
For he is influenced by the perception of a certain plausible
resemblance, when he says that the heaven is that which does,
and the earth that which suffers, and therefore attributes the
masculine principle to the one, and the feminine to the other,&mdash;not
considering that it is rather He who made both heaven
and earth who is the maker of both activity and passivity.
On this principle he interprets the celebrated mysteries of the
Samothracians, and promises, with an air of great devoutness,
that he will by writing expound these mysteries, which have
not been so much as known to his countrymen, and will send
them his exposition. Then he says that he had from many
proofs gathered that, in those mysteries, among the images
one signifies heaven, another the earth, another the patterns
of things, which Plato calls ideas. He makes Jupiter to
signify heaven, Juno the earth, Minerva the ideas. Heaven,
by which anything is made; the earth, from which it is made;
and the pattern, according to which it is made. But, with
respect to the last, I am forgetting to say that Plato attributed
so great an importance to these ideas as to say, not that anything
was made by heaven according to them, but that according
to them heaven itself was made.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> To return, however,&mdash;it
is to be observed that Varro has, in the book on the select
gods, lost that theory of these gods, in whom he has, as it
were, embraced all things. For he assigns the male gods to
heaven, the females to earth; among which latter he has
placed Minerva, whom he had before placed above heaven
itself. Then the male god Neptune is in the sea, which
pertains rather to earth than to heaven. Last of all, father
Dis, who is called in Greek &#928;&#955;&#959;&#8059;&#964;&#969;&#957;, another male god,
brother of both (Jupiter and Neptune), is also held to be
a god of the earth, holding the upper region of the earth
himself, and allotting the nether region to his wife Proserpine.
How, then, do they attempt to refer the gods to heaven, and
the goddesses to earth? What solidity, what consistency,
what sobriety has this disputation? But that Tellus is the
origin of the goddesses,&mdash;the great mother, to wit, beside whom
there is continually the noise of the mad and abominable
revelry of effeminates and mutilated men, and men who cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
themselves, and indulge in frantic gesticulations,&mdash;how is it,
then, that Janus is called the head of the gods, and Tellus the
head of the goddesses? In the one case error does not make
one head, and in the other frenzy does not make a sane one.
Why do they vainly attempt to refer these to the world?
Even if they could do so, no pious person worships the world
for the true God. Nevertheless, plain truth makes it evident
that they are not able even to do this. Let them rather
identify them with dead men and most wicked demons, and
no further question will remain.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>That all things which the physical theologists have referred to the world and
its parts, they ought to have referred to the one true God</i>.</p>

<p>For all those things which, according to the account given
of those gods, are referred to the world by so-called physical
interpretation, may, without any religious scruple, be rather
assigned to the true God, who made heaven and earth, and
created every soul and every body; and the following is the
manner in which we see that this may be done. We worship
God,&mdash;not heaven and earth, of which two parts this world
consists, nor the soul or souls diffused through all living
things,&mdash;but God who made heaven and earth, and all things
which are in them; who made every soul, whatever be the
nature of its life, whether it have life without sensation and
reason, or life with sensation, or life with both sensation and
reason.</p>

the causes of things; who hath created the virtue of
seeds; who hath given to what creatures He would a rational
soul, which is called mind; who hath bestowed the faculty and
use of speech; who hath imparted the gift of foretelling future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
things to whatever spirits it seemed to Him good; who also
Himself predicts future things, through whom He pleases,
and through whom He will removes diseases; who, when the
human race is to be corrected and chastised by wars, regulates
also the beginnings, progress, and ends of these wars;
who hath created and governs the most vehement and most
violent fire of this world, in due relation and proportion to
the other elements of immense nature; who is the governor
of all the waters; who hath made the sun brightest of all
material lights, and hath given him suitable power and
motion; who hath not withdrawn, even from the inhabitants
of the nether world, His dominion and power; who hath
appointed to mortal natures their suitable seed and nourishment,
dry or liquid; who establishes and makes fruitful the
earth; who bountifully bestows its fruits on animals and on
men; who knows and ordains, not only principal causes, but
also subsequent causes; who hath determined for the moon
her motion; who affords ways in heaven and on earth for
passage from one place to another; who hath granted also to
human minds, which He hath created, the knowledge of the
various arts for the help of life and nature; who hath
appointed the union of male and female for the propagation
of offspring; who hath favoured the societies of men with the
gift of terrestrial fire for the simplest and most familiar purposes,
to burn on the hearth and to give light. These are,
then, the things which that most acute and most learned man
Varro has laboured to distribute among the select gods, by I
know not what physical interpretation, which he has got from
other sources, and also conjectured for himself. But these
things the one true God makes and does, but as <i>the same</i> God,&mdash;that
is, as He who is wholly everywhere, included in no
space, bound by no chains, mutable in no part of His being,
filling heaven and earth with omnipresent power, not with a
needy nature. Therefore He governs all things in such a
manner as to allow them to perform and exercise their own
proper movements. For although they can be nothing without
Him, they are not what He is. He does also many things
through angels; but only from Himself does He beatify angels.
So also, though He send angels to men for certain purposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
He does not for all that beatify men by the good inherent in
the angels, but by Himself, as He does the angels themselves.</p>

lavishes on good and bad alike, we have from Him a great
manifestation of great love, which belongs only to the good.
For although we can never sufficiently give thanks to Him,
that we are, that we live, that we behold heaven and earth,
that we have mind and reason by which to seek after Him
who made all these things, nevertheless, what hearts, what
number of tongues, shall affirm that they are sufficient to
render thanks to Him for this, that He hath not wholly
departed from us, laden and overwhelmed with sins, averse to
the contemplation of His light, and blinded by the love of
darkness, that is, of iniquity, but hath sent to us His own
Word, who is His only Son, that by His birth and suffering
for us in the flesh, which He assumed, we might know how
much God valued man, and that by that unique sacrifice we
might be purified from all our sins, and that, love being shed
abroad in our hearts by His Spirit, we might, having surmounted
all difficulties, come into eternal rest, and the
ineffable sweetness of the contemplation of Himself?</p>


<p class="center">32. <i>That at no time in the past was the mystery of Christ's redemption awanting,
but was at all times declared, though in various forms.</i></p>

<p>This mystery of eternal life, even from the beginning of the
human race, was, by certain signs and sacraments suitable to
the times, announced through angels to those to whom it was
meet. Then the Hebrew people was congregated into one
republic, as it were, to perform this mystery; and in that republic
was foretold, sometimes through men who understood
what they spake, and sometimes through men who understood
not, all that had transpired since the advent of Christ until now,
and all that will transpire. This same nation, too, was afterwards
dispersed through the nations, in order to testify to the
scriptures in which eternal salvation in Christ had been declared.
For not only the prophecies which are contained in words, nor
only the precepts for the right conduct of life, which teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
morals and piety, and are contained in the sacred writings,&mdash;not
only these, but also the rites, priesthood, tabernacle or temple,
altars, sacrifices, ceremonies, and whatever else belongs to that
service which is due to God, and which in Greek is properly
called &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;,&mdash;all these signified and fore-announced those
things which we who believe in Jesus Christ unto eternal life
believe to have been fulfilled, or behold in process of fulfilment,
or confidently believe shall yet be fulfilled.</p>


<p class="center">33. <i>That only through the Christian religion could the deceit of malign spirits,
who rejoice in the errors of men, have been manifested.</i></p>

<p>This, the only true religion, has alone been able to manifest
that the gods of the nations are most impure demons, who
desire to be thought gods, availing themselves of the names of
certain defunct souls, or the appearance of mundane creatures,
and with proud impurity rejoicing in things most base and
infamous, as though in divine honours, and envying human
souls their conversion to the true God. From whose most
cruel and most impious dominion a man is liberated when he
believes on Him who has afforded an example of humility,
following which men may rise as great as was that pride by
which they fell. Hence are not only those gods, concerning
whom we have already spoken much, and many others belonging
to different nations and lands, but also those of whom we
are now treating, who have been selected as it were into the
senate of the gods,&mdash;selected, however, on account of the
notoriousness of their crimes, not on account of the dignity
of their virtues,&mdash;whose sacred things Varro attempts to
refer to certain natural reasons, seeking to make base things
honourable, but cannot find how to square and agree with
these reasons, because these are not the causes of those rites,
which he thinks, or rather wishes to be thought to be so. For
had not only these, but also all others of this kind, been real
causes, even though they had nothing to do with the true God
and eternal life, which is to be sought in religion, they would,
by affording some sort of reason drawn from the nature of
things, have mitigated in some degree that offence which was
occasioned by some turpitude or absurdity in the sacred rites,
which was not understood. This he attempted to do in
respect to certain fables of the theatres, or mysteries of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
shrines; but he did not acquit the theatres of likeness to the
shrines, but rather condemned the shrines for likeness to the
theatres. However, he in some way made the attempt to
soothe the feelings shocked by horrible things, by rendering
what he would have to be natural interpretations.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>34. <i>Concerning the books of Numa Pompilius, which the senate ordered to be
burned, in order that the causes of sacred rites therein assigned should
not become known.</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>But, on the other hand, we find, as the same most learned
man has related, that the causes of the sacred rites which
were given from the books of Numa Pompilius could by no
means be tolerated, and were considered unworthy, not only
to become known to the religious by being read, but even to
lie written in the darkness in which they had been concealed.
For now let me say what I promised in the third book of this
work to say in its proper place. For, as we read in the same
Varro's book on the worship of the gods, "A certain one
Terentius had a field at the Janiculum, and once, when his
ploughman was passing the plough near to the tomb of Numa
Pompilius, he turned up from the ground the books of Numa,
in which were written the causes of the sacred institutions;
which books he carried to the prætor, who, having read the
beginnings of them, referred to the senate what seemed to be
a matter of so much importance. And when the chief senators
had read certain of the causes why this or that rite was instituted,
the senate assented to the dead Numa, and the conscript
fathers, as though concerned for the interests of religion,
ordered the prætor to burn the books."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Let each one believe
what he thinks; nay, let every champion of such impiety
say whatever mad contention may suggest. For my part, let
it suffice to suggest that the causes of those sacred things
which were written down by King Numa Pompilius, the
institutor of the Roman rites, ought never to have become
known to people or senate, or even to the priests themselves;
and also that Numa himself attained to these secrets of
demons by an illicit curiosity, in order that he might write
them down, so as to be able, by reading, to be reminded of
them. However, though he was king, and had no cause to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
be afraid of any one, he neither dared to teach them to any
one, nor to destroy them by obliteration, or any other form of
destruction. Therefore, because he was unwilling that any
one should know them, lest men should be taught infamous
things, and because he was afraid to violate them, lest he
should enrage the demons against himself, he buried them in
what he thought a safe place, believing that a plough could
not approach his sepulchre. But the senate, fearing to condemn
the religious solemnities of their ancestors, and therefore
compelled to assent to Numa, were nevertheless so convinced
that those books were pernicious, that they did not order
them to be buried again, knowing that human curiosity would
thereby be excited to seek with far greater eagerness after
the matter already divulged, but ordered the scandalous relics
to be destroyed with fire; because, as they thought it was now
a necessity to perform those sacred rites, they judged that the
error arising from ignorance of their causes was more tolerable
than the disturbance which the knowledge of them would
occasion the state.</p>


<p class="center">35. <i>Concerning the hydromancy through which Numa was befooled by certain
images of demons seen in the water.</i></p>

<p>For Numa himself also, to whom no prophet of God, no
holy angel was sent, was driven to have recourse to hydromancy,
that he might see the images of the gods in the water
(or, rather, appearances whereby the demons made sport of
him), and might learn from them what he ought to ordain and
observe in the sacred rites. This kind of divination, says
Varro, was introduced from the Persians, and was used by
Numa himself, and at an after time by the philosopher
Pythagoras. In this divination, he says, they also inquire at
the inhabitants of the nether world, and make use of blood;
and this the Greeks call &#957;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#957;. But whether it be
called necromancy or hydromancy it is the same thing, for in
either case the dead are supposed to foretell future things.
But by what artifices these things are done, let themselves
consider; for I am unwilling to say that these artifices were
wont to be prohibited by the laws, and to be very severely
punished even in the Gentile states, before the advent of our
Saviour. I am unwilling, I say, to affirm this, for perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
even such things were then allowed. However, it was by
these arts that Pompilius learned those sacred rites which he
gave forth as facts, whilst he concealed their causes; for
even he himself was afraid of that which he had learned.
The senate also caused the books in which those causes were
recorded to be burned. What is it, then, to me, that Varro
attempts to adduce all sorts of fanciful physical interpretations,
which if these books had contained, they would certainly
not have been burned? For otherwise the conscript fathers
would also have burned those books which Varro published
and dedicated to the high priest Cæsar.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Now Numa is said
to have married the nymph Egeria, because (as Varro explains
it in the forementioned book) he carried forth<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> water
wherewith to perform his hydromancy. Thus facts are wont
to be converted into fables through false colourings. It was
by that hydromancy, then, that that over-curious Roman king
learned both the sacred rites which were to be written in the
books of the priests, and also the causes of those rites,&mdash;which
latter, however, he was unwilling that any one besides himself
should know. Wherefore he made these causes, as it were,
to die along with himself, taking care to have them written
by themselves, and removed from the knowledge of men by
being buried in the earth. Wherefore the things which are
written in those books were either abominations of demons,
so foul and noxious as to render that whole civil theology
execrable even in the eyes of such men as those senators, who
had accepted so many shameful things in the sacred rites
themselves, or they were nothing else than the accounts of
dead men, whom, through the lapse of ages, almost all the
Gentile nations had come to believe to be immortal gods;
whilst those same demons were delighted even with such rites,
having presented themselves to receive worship under pretence
of being those very dead men whom they had caused to be
thought immortal gods by certain fallacious miracles, performed
in order to establish that belief. But, by the hidden providence
of the true God, these demons were permitted to confess
these things to their friend Numa, having been gained by those
arts through which necromancy could be performed, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
were not constrained to admonish him rather at his death to
burn than to bury the books in which they were written.
But, in order that these books might be unknown, the demons
could not resist the plough by which they were thrown up, or
the pen of Varro, through which the things which were done
in reference to this matter have come down even to our knowledge.
For they are not able to effect anything which they
are not allowed; but they are permitted to influence those
whom God, in His deep and just judgment, according to their
deserts, gives over either to be simply afflicted by them, or to
be also subdued and deceived. But how pernicious these
writings were judged to be, or how alien from the worship of
the true Divinity, may be understood from the fact that the
senate preferred to burn what Pompilius had hid, rather than
to fear what he feared, so that he could not dare to do that.
Wherefore let him who does not desire to live a pious life
even now, seek eternal life by means of such rites. But let
him who does not wish to have fellowship with malign demons
have no fear for the noxious superstition wherewith they are
worshipped, but let him recognise the true religion by which
they are unmasked and vanquished.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>That the question of natural theology is to be discussed with those philosophers
who sought a more excellent wisdom</i>.</p>

<p>We shall require to apply our mind with far greater
intensity to the present question than was requisite
in the solution and unfolding of the questions handled in the
preceding books; for it is not with ordinary men, but with
philosophers that we must confer concerning the theology
which they call natural. For it is not like the fabulous, that
is, the theatrical; nor the civil, that is, the urban theology:
the one of which displays the crimes of the gods, whilst the
other manifests their criminal desires, which demonstrate them
to be rather malign demons than gods. It is, we say, with
philosophers we have to confer with respect to this theology,&mdash;men
whose very name, if rendered into Latin, signifies those
who profess the love of wisdom. Now, if wisdom is God,
who made all things, as is attested by the divine authority
and truth,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> then the philosopher is a lover of God. But since
the thing itself, which is called by this name, exists not in all
who glory in the name,&mdash;for it does not follow, of course, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
all who are called philosophers are lovers of true wisdom,&mdash;we
must needs select from the number of those with whose
opinions we have been able to acquaint ourselves by reading,
some with whom we may not unworthily engage in the treatment
of this question. For I have not in this work undertaken
to refute all the vain opinions of the philosophers,
but only such as pertain to theology, which Greek word we
understand to mean an account or explanation of the divine
nature. Nor, again, have I undertaken to refute all the vain
theological opinions of all the philosophers, but only of such
of them as, agreeing in the belief that there is a divine nature,
and that this divine nature is concerned about human affairs,
do nevertheless deny that the worship of the one unchangeable
God is sufficient for the obtaining of a blessed life after death,
as well as at the present time; and hold that, in order to
obtain that life, many gods, created, indeed, and appointed to
their several spheres by that one God, are to be worshipped.
These approach nearer to the truth than even Varro; for,
whilst he saw no difficulty in extending natural theology in
its entirety even to the world and the soul of the world, these
acknowledge God as existing above all that is of the nature of
soul, and as the Creator not only of this visible world, which
is often called heaven and earth, but also of every soul whatsoever,
and as Him who gives blessedness to the rational soul,&mdash;of
which kind is the human soul,&mdash;by participation in His
own unchangeable and incorporeal light. There is no one,
who has even a slender knowledge of these things, who does
not know of the Platonic philosophers, who derive their name
from their master Plato. Concerning this Plato, then, I will
briefly state such things as I deem necessary to the present
question, mentioning beforehand those who preceded him in
time in the same department of literature.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Concerning the two schools of philosophers, that is, the Italic and Ionic, and
their founders.</i></p>

<p>As far as concerns the literature of the Greeks, whose
language holds a more illustrious place than any of the languages
of the other nations, history mentions two schools of
philosophers, the one called the Italic school, originating in
that part of Italy which was formerly called Magna Græcia;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the other called the Ionic school, having its origin in those
regions which are still called by the name of Greece. The
Italic school had for its founder Pythagoras of Samos, to whom
also the term "philosophy" is said to owe its origin. For
whereas formerly those who seemed to excel others by the
laudable manner in which they regulated their lives were
called sages, Pythagoras, on being asked what he professed,
replied that he was a philosopher, that is, a student or lover
of wisdom; for it seemed to him to be the height of arrogance
to profess oneself a sage.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The founder of the Ionic school,
again, was Thales of Miletus, one of those seven who were
styled the "seven sages," of whom six were distinguished by
the kind of life they lived, and by certain maxims which they
gave forth for the proper conduct of life. Thales was distinguished
as an investigator into the nature of things; and, in
order that he might have successors in his school, he committed
his dissertations to writing. That, however, which
especially rendered him eminent was his ability, by means of
astronomical calculations, even to predict eclipses of the sun
and moon. He thought, however, that water was the first
principle of things, and that of it all the elements of the
world, the world itself, and all things which are generated in
it, ultimately consist. Over all this work, however, which,
when we consider the world, appears so admirable, he set
nothing of the nature of divine mind. To him succeeded
Anaximander, his pupil, who held a different opinion concerning
the nature of things; for he did not hold that all things
spring from one principle, as Thales did, who held that principle
to be water, but thought that each thing springs from its
own proper principle. These principles of things he believed
to be infinite in number, and thought that they generated
innumerable worlds, and all the things which arise in them.
He thought, also, that these worlds are subject to a perpetual
process of alternate dissolution and regeneration, each one
continuing for a longer or shorter period of time, according
to the nature of the case; nor did he, any more than Thales,
attribute anything to a divine mind in the production of all
this activity of things. Anaximander left as his successor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
disciple Anaximenes, who attributed all the causes of things
to an infinite air. He neither denied nor ignored the existence
of gods, but, so far from believing that the air was made by
them, he held, on the contrary, that they sprang from the air.
Anaxagoras, however, who was his pupil, perceived that a
divine mind was the productive cause of all things which we
see, and said that all the various kinds of things, according
to their several modes and species, were produced out of an
infinite matter consisting of homogeneous particles, but by the
efficiency of a divine mind. Diogenes, also, another pupil of
Anaximenes, said that a certain air was the original substance
of things out of which all things were produced, but that it
was possessed of a divine reason, without which nothing could
be produced from it. Anaxagoras was succeeded by his disciple
Archelaus, who also thought that all things consisted of
homogeneous particles, of which each particular thing was
made, but that those particles were pervaded by a divine
mind, which perpetually energized all the eternal bodies,
namely, those particles, so that they are alternately united
and separated. Socrates, the master of Plato, is said to have
been the disciple of Archelaus; and on Plato's account it is
that I have given this brief historical sketch of the whole
history of these schools.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Of the Socratic philosophy.</i></p>

<p>Socrates is said to have been the first who directed the
entire effort of philosophy to the correction and regulation of
manners, all who went before him having expended their
greatest efforts in the investigation of physical, that is, natural
phenomena. However, it seems to me that it cannot be
certainly discovered whether Socrates did this because he was
wearied of obscure and uncertain things, and so wished to
direct his mind to the discovery of something manifest and
certain, which was necessary in order to the obtaining of a
blessed life,&mdash;that one great object toward which the labour,
vigilance, and industry of all philosophers seem to have been
directed,&mdash;or whether (as some yet more favourable to him
suppose) he did it because he was unwilling that minds
defiled with earthly desires should essay to raise themselves
upward to divine things. For he saw that the causes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
things were sought for by them,&mdash;which causes he believed to
be ultimately reducible to nothing else than the will of the
one true and supreme God,&mdash;and on this account he thought
they could only be comprehended by a purified mind; and
therefore that all diligence ought to be given to the purification
of the life by good morals, in order that the mind,
delivered from the depressing weight of lusts, might raise
itself upward by its native vigour to eternal things, and
might, with purified understanding, contemplate that nature
which is incorporeal and unchangeable light, where live the
causes of all created natures. It is evident, however, that
he hunted out and pursued, with a wonderful pleasantness
of style and argument, and with a most pointed and insinuating
urbanity, the foolishness of ignorant men, who thought
that they knew this or that,&mdash;sometimes confessing his own
ignorance, and sometimes dissimulating his knowledge, even
in those very moral questions to which he seems to have
directed the whole force of his mind. And hence there arose
hostility against him, which ended in his being calumniously
impeached, and condemned to death. Afterwards, however,
that very city of the Athenians, which had publicly condemned
him, did publicly bewail him,&mdash;the popular indignation
having turned with such vehemence on his accusers, that
one of them perished by the violence of the multitude, whilst
the other only escaped a like punishment by voluntary and
perpetual exile.</p>

<p>Illustrious, therefore, both in his life and in his death,
Socrates left very many disciples of his philosophy, who
vied with one another in desire for proficiency in handling
those moral questions which concern the chief good
(<i>summum bonum</i>), the possession of which can make a man
blessed; and because, in the disputations of Socrates, where
he raises all manner of questions, makes assertions, and
then demolishes them, it did not evidently appear what he
held to be the chief good, every one took from these disputations
what pleased him best, and every one placed the
final good<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> in whatever it appeared to himself to consist.
Now, that which is called the final good is that at which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
when one has arrived, he is blessed. But so diverse were
the opinions held by those followers of Socrates concerning
this final good, that (a thing scarcely to be credited with
respect to the followers of one master) some placed the chief
good in pleasure, as Aristippus, others in virtue, as Antisthenes.
Indeed, it were tedious to recount the various
opinions of various disciples.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Concerning Plato, the chief among the disciples of Socrates, and his
threefold division of philosophy.</i></p>

<p>But, among the disciples of Socrates, Plato was the one who
shone with a glory which far excelled that of the others, and
who not unjustly eclipsed them all. By birth an Athenian
of honourable parentage, he far surpassed his fellow-disciples
in natural endowments, of which he was possessed in a wonderful
degree. Yet, deeming himself and the Socratic discipline
far from sufficient for bringing philosophy to perfection, he
travelled as extensively as he was able, going to every place
famed for the cultivation of any science of which he could
make himself master. Thus he learned from the Egyptians
whatever they held and taught as important; and from Egypt,
passing into those parts of Italy which were filled with the
fame of the Pythagoreans, he mastered, with the greatest
facility, and under the most eminent teachers, all the Italic
philosophy which was then in vogue. And, as he had a
peculiar love for his master Socrates, he made him the speaker
in all his dialogues, putting into his mouth whatever he had
learned, either from others, or from the efforts of his own
powerful intellect, tempering even his moral disputations with
the grace and politeness of the Socratic style. And, as the
study of wisdom consists in action and contemplation, so that
one part of it may be called active, and the other contemplative,&mdash;the
active part having reference to the conduct of life,
that is, to the regulation of morals, and the contemplative part
to the investigation into the causes of nature and into pure
truth,&mdash;Socrates is said to have excelled in the active part of
that study, while Pythagoras gave more attention to its contemplative
part, on which he brought to bear all the force of
his great intellect. To Plato is given the praise of having
perfected philosophy by combining both parts into one. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
then divides it into three parts,&mdash;the first moral, which is
chiefly occupied with action; the second natural, of which the
object is contemplation; and the third rational, which discriminates
between the true and the false. And though this
last is necessary both to action and contemplation, it is
contemplation, nevertheless, which lays peculiar claim to the
office of investigating the nature of truth. Thus this tripartite
division is not contrary to that which made the study of
wisdom to consist in action and contemplation. Now, as to
what Plato thought with respect to each of these parts,&mdash;that
is, what he believed to be the end of all actions, the cause of
all natures, and the light of all intelligences,&mdash;it would be a
question too long to discuss, and about which we ought not
to make any rash affirmation. For, as Plato liked and constantly
affected the well-known method of his master Socrates,
namely, that of dissimulating his knowledge or his opinions,
it is not easy to discover clearly what he himself thought on
various matters, any more than it is to discover what were
the real opinions of Socrates. We must, nevertheless, insert
into our work certain of those opinions which he expresses in
his writings, whether he himself uttered them, or narrates
them as expressed by others, and seems himself to approve
of,&mdash;opinions sometimes favourable to the true religion, which
our faith takes up and defends, and sometimes contrary to it,
as, for example, in the questions concerning the existence of
one God or of many, as it relates to the truly blessed life
which is to be after death. For those who are praised as
having most closely followed Plato, who is justly preferred to
all the other philosophers of the Gentiles, and who are said
to have manifested the greatest acuteness in understanding
him, do perhaps entertain such an idea of God as to admit
that in Him are to be found the cause of existence, the ultimate
reason for the understanding, and the end in reference
to which the whole life is to be regulated. Of which three
things, the first is understood to pertain to the natural, the
second to the rational, and the third to the moral part of
philosophy. For if man has been so created as to attain,
through that which is most excellent in him, to that which
excels all things,&mdash;that is, to the one true and absolutely good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
God, without whom no nature exists, no doctrine instructs, no
exercise profits,&mdash;let Him be sought in whom all things are
secure to us, let Him be discovered in whom all truth becomes
certain to us, let Him be loved in whom all becomes right
to us.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>5. <i>That it is especially with the Platonists that we must carry on our disputations
on matters of theology, their opinions being preferable to those of all
other philosophers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If, then, Plato defined the wise man as one who imitates,
knows, loves this God, and who is rendered blessed through
fellowship with Him in His own blessedness, why discuss
with the other philosophers? It is evident that none come
nearer to us than the Platonists. To them, therefore, let that
fabulous theology give place which delights the minds of men
with the crimes of the gods; and that civil theology also, in
which impure demons, under the name of gods, have seduced
the peoples of the earth given up to earthly pleasures, desiring
to be honoured by the errors of men, and, by filling the minds
of their worshippers with impure desires, exciting them to
make the representation of their crimes one of the rites of
their worship, whilst they themselves found in the spectators
of these exhibitions a most pleasing spectacle,&mdash;a theology in
which, whatever was honourable in the temple, was defiled by
its mixture with the obscenity of the theatre, and whatever
was base in the theatre was vindicated by the abominations
of the temples. To these philosophers also the interpretations
of Varro must give place, in which he explains the sacred rites
as having reference to heaven and earth, and to the seeds and
operations of perishable things; for, in the first place, those
rites have not the signification which he would have men believe
is attached to them, and therefore truth does not follow
him in his attempt so to interpret them; and even if they
had this signification, still those things ought not to be worshipped
by the rational soul as its god which are placed below
it in the scale of nature, nor ought the soul to prefer to itself
as gods things to which the true God has given it the preference.
The same must be said of those writings pertaining to
the sacred rites, which Numa Pompilius took care to conceal
by causing them to be buried along with himself, and which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
when they were afterwards turned up by the plough, were
burned by order of the senate. And, to treat Numa with
all honour, let us mention as belonging to the same rank as
these writings that which Alexander of Macedon wrote to his
mother as communicated to him by Leo, an Egyptian high
priest. In this letter not only Picus and Faunus, and Æneas
and Romulus, or even Hercules and Æsculapius and Liber,
born of Semele, and the twin sons of Tyndareus, or any
other mortals who have been deified, but even the principal
gods themselves,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> to whom Cicero, in his Tusculan questions,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
alludes without mentioning their names, Jupiter, Juno,
Saturn, Vulcan, Vesta, and many others whom Varro attempts
to identify with the parts or the elements of the world, are
shown to have been men. There is, as we have said, a similarity
between this case and that of Numa; for, the priest
being afraid because he had revealed a mystery, earnestly
begged of Alexander to command his mother to burn the letter
which conveyed these communications to her. Let these two
theologies, then, the fabulous and the civil, give place to the
Platonic philosophers, who have recognised the true God as
the author of all things, the source of the light of truth, and
the bountiful bestower of all blessedness. And not these only,
but to these great acknowledgers of so great a God, those
philosophers must yield who, having their mind enslaved to
their body, supposed the principles of all things to be material;
as Thales, who held that the first principle of all things was
water; Anaximenes, that it was air; the Stoics, that it was
fire; Epicurus, who affirmed that it consisted of atoms, that
is to say, of minute corpuscules; and many others whom it is
needless to enumerate, but who believed that bodies, simple
or compound, animate or inanimate, but nevertheless bodies,
were the cause and principle of all things. For some of them&mdash;as,
for instance, the Epicureans&mdash;believed that living things
could originate from things without life; others held that all
things living or without life spring from a living principle,
but that, nevertheless, all things, being material, spring from
a material principle. For the Stoics thought that fire, that
is, one of the four material elements of which this visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
world is composed, was both living and intelligent, the maker
of the world and of all things contained in it,&mdash;that it was
in fact God. These and others like them have only been able
to suppose that which their hearts enslaved to sense have
vainly suggested to them. And yet they have within themselves
something which they could not see: they represented
to themselves inwardly things which they had seen without,
even when they were not seeing them, but only thinking of
them. But this representation in thought is no longer a
body, but only the similitude of a body; and that faculty of
the mind by which this similitude of a body is seen is neither
a body nor the similitude of a body; and the faculty which
judges whether the representation is beautiful or ugly is
without doubt superior to the object judged of. This principle
is the understanding of man, the rational soul; and it is
certainly not a body, since that similitude of a body which it
beholds and judges of is itself not a body. The soul is neither
earth, nor water, nor air, nor fire, of which four bodies, called
the four elements, we see that this world is composed. And
if the soul is not a body, how should God, its Creator, be a
body? Let all those philosophers, then, give place, as we
have said, to the Platonists, and those also who have been
ashamed to say that God is a body, but yet have thought that
our souls are of the same nature as God. They have not been
staggered by the great changeableness of the soul,&mdash;an attribute
which it would be impious to ascribe to the divine nature,&mdash;but
they say it is the body which changes the soul, for in
itself it is unchangeable. As well might they say, "Flesh is
wounded by some body, for in itself it is invulnerable." In a
word, that which is unchangeable can be changed by nothing,
so that that which can be changed by the body cannot properly
be said to be immutable.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Concerning the meaning of the Platonists in that part of philosophy called
physical.</i></p>

<p>These philosophers, then, whom we see not undeservedly
exalted above the rest in fame and glory, have seen that no
material body is God, and therefore they have transcended
all bodies in seeking for God. They have seen that whatever
is changeable is not the most high God, and therefore they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
have transcended every soul and all changeable spirits in
seeking the supreme. They have seen also that, in every
changeable thing, the form which makes it that which it is,
whatever be its mode or nature, can only <i>be</i> through Him
who truly <i>is</i>, because He is unchangeable. And therefore,
whether we consider the whole body of the world, its figure,
qualities, and orderly movement, and also all the bodies
which are in it; or whether we consider all life, either that
which nourishes and maintains, as the life of trees, or that
which, besides this, has also sensation, as the life of beasts;
or that which adds to all these intelligence, as the life of
man; or that which does not need the support of nutriment,
but only maintains, feels, understands, as the life of angels,&mdash;all
can only <i>be</i> through Him who absolutely <i>is</i>. For to Him
it is not one thing to <i>be</i>, and another to live, as though He
could <i>be</i>, not living; nor is it to Him one thing to live, and
another thing to understand, as though He could live, not
understanding; nor is it to Him one thing to understand,
another thing to be blessed, as though He could understand
and not be blessed. But to Him to live, to understand, to
be blessed, are to <i>be</i>. They have understood, from this unchangeableness
and this simplicity, that all things must have
been made by Him, and that He could Himself have been
made by none. For they have considered that whatever is
is either body or life, and that life is something better than
body, and that the nature of body is sensible, and that of
life intelligible. Therefore they have preferred the intelligible
nature to the sensible. We mean by sensible things such
things as can be perceived by the sight and touch of the body;
by intelligible things, such as can be understood by the sight
of the mind. For there is no corporeal beauty, whether in
the condition of a body, as figure, or in its movement, as in
music, of which it is not the mind that judges. But this
could never have been, had there not existed in the mind
itself a superior form of these things, without bulk, without
noise of voice, without space and time. But even in respect
of these things, had the mind not been mutable, it would not
have been possible for one to judge better than another with
regard to sensible forms. He who is clever judges better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
than he who is slow, he who is skilled than he who is unskilful,
he who is practised than he who is unpractised; and
the same person judges better after he has gained experience
than he did before. But that which is capable of more and
less is mutable; whence able men, who have thought deeply
on these things, have gathered that the first form is not to
be found in those things whose form is changeable. Since,
therefore, they saw that body and mind might be more or
less beautiful in form, and that, if they wanted form, they
could have no existence, they saw that there is some existence
in which is the first form, unchangeable, and therefore
not admitting of degrees of comparison, and in that they most
rightly believed was the first principle of things, which was
not made, and by which all things were made. Therefore
that which is known of God He manifested to them when
His invisible things were seen by them, being understood
by those things which have been made; also His eternal
power and Godhead by whom all visible and temporal things
have been created.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> We have said enough upon that part of
theology which they call physical, that is, natural.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>How much the Platonists are to be held as excelling other philosophers in
logic</i>, i.e. <i>rational philosophy.</i></p>

<p>Then, again, as far as regards the doctrine which treats of
that which they call logic, that is, rational philosophy, far be
it from us to compare them with those who attributed to
the bodily senses the faculty of discriminating truth, and
thought that all we learn is to be measured by their untrustworthy
and fallacious rules. Such were the Epicureans,
and all of the same school. Such also were the Stoics, who
ascribed to the bodily senses that expertness in disputation
which they so ardently love, called by them dialectic, asserting
that from the senses the mind conceives the notions
(&#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#953;) of those things which they explicate by definition.
And hence is developed the whole plan and connection of
their learning and teaching. I often wonder, with respect to
this, how they can say that none are beautiful but the wise;
for by what bodily sense have they perceived that beauty,
by what eyes of the flesh have they seen wisdom's comeliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of form? Those, however, whom we justly rank before
all others, have distinguished those things which are conceived
by the mind from those which are perceived by the
senses, neither taking away from the senses anything to
which they are competent, nor attributing to them anything
beyond their competency. And the light of our understandings,
by which all things are learned by us, they have affirmed
to be that selfsame God by whom all things were made.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>That the Platonists hold the first rank in moral philosophy also.</i></p>

<p>The remaining part of philosophy is morals, or what is
called by the Greeks &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8053;, in which is discussed the question
concerning the chief good,&mdash;that which will leave us nothing
further to seek in order to be blessed, if only we make all
our actions refer to it, and seek it not for the sake of something
else, but for its own sake. Therefore it is called the
end, because we wish other things on account of it, but itself
only for its own sake. This beatific good, therefore, according
to some, comes to a man from the body, according to others,
from the mind, and, according to others, from both together.
For they saw that man himself consists of soul and body;
and therefore they believed that from either of these two,
or from both together, their well-being must proceed, consisting
in a certain final good, which could render them blessed,
and to which they might refer all their actions, not requiring
anything ulterior to which to refer that good itself. This is
why those who have added a third kind of good things, which
they call extrinsic,&mdash;as honour, glory, wealth, and the like,&mdash;have
not regarded them as part of the final good, that is, to be
sought after for their own sake, but as things which are to be
sought for the sake of something else, affirming that this kind
of good is good to the good, and evil to the evil. Wherefore,
whether they have sought the good of man from the
mind or from the body, or from both together, it is still only
from man they have supposed that it must be sought. But
they who have sought it from the body have sought it from
the inferior part of man; they who have sought it from the
mind, from the superior part; and they who have sought it
from both, from the whole man. Whether, therefore, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
have sought it from any part, or from the whole man, still
they have only sought it from man; nor have these differences,
being three, given rise only to three dissentient sects
of philosophers, but to many. For diverse philosophers have
held diverse opinions, both concerning the good of the body,
and the good of the mind, and the good of both together.
Let, therefore, all these give place to those philosophers who
have not affirmed that a man is blessed by the enjoyment of
the body, or by the enjoyment of the mind, but by the enjoyment
of God,&mdash;enjoying Him, however, not as the mind does
the body or itself, or as one friend enjoys another, but as the
eye enjoys light, if, indeed, we may draw any comparison
between these things. But what the nature of this comparison
is, will, if God help me, be shown in another place, to the
best of my ability. At present, it is sufficient to mention
that Plato determined the final good to be to live according
to virtue, and affirmed that he only can attain to virtue who
knows and imitates God,&mdash;which knowledge and imitation are
the only cause of blessedness. Therefore he did not doubt
that to philosophize is to love God, whose nature is incorporeal.
Whence it certainly follows that the student of
wisdom, that is, the philosopher, will then become blessed
when he shall have begun to enjoy God. For though he is
not necessarily blessed who enjoys that which he loves (for
many are miserable by loving that which ought not to be
loved, and still more miserable when they enjoy it), nevertheless
no one is blessed who does not enjoy that which he loves.
For even they who love things which ought not to be loved
do not count themselves blessed by loving merely, but by
enjoying them. Who, then, but the most miserable will deny
that he is blessed, who enjoys that which he loves, and loves
the true and highest good? But the true and highest good,
according to Plato, is God, and therefore he would call him
a philosopher who loves God; for philosophy is directed to the
obtaining of the blessed life, and he who loves God is blessed
in the enjoyment of God.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Concerning that philosophy which has come nearest to the Christian faith.</i></p>

<p>Whatever philosophers, therefore, thought concerning the
supreme God, that He is both the maker of all created things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the light by which things are known, and the good in reference
to which things are to be done; that we have in Him the
first principle of nature, the truth of doctrine, and the happiness
of life,&mdash;whether these philosophers may be more suitably
called Platonists, or whether they may give some other name
to their sect; whether, we say, that only the chief men of the
Ionic school, such as Plato himself, and they who have well
understood him, have thought thus; or whether we also include
the Italic school, on account of Pythagoras and the
Pythagoreans, and all who may have held like opinions; and,
lastly, whether also we include all who have been held wise
men and philosophers among all nations who are discovered to
have seen and taught this, be they Atlantics, Libyans, Egyptians,
Indians, Persians, Chaldeans, Scythians, Gauls, Spaniards, or
of other nations,&mdash;we prefer these to all other philosophers,
and confess that they approach nearest to us.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>That the excellency of the Christian religion is above all the science of
philosophers.</i></p>

<p>For although a Christian man instructed only in ecclesiastical
literature may perhaps be ignorant of the very name of
Platonists, and may not even know that there have existed
two schools of philosophers speaking the Greek tongue, to
wit, the Ionic and Italic, he is nevertheless not so deaf with
respect to human affairs, as not to know that philosophers
profess the study, and even the possession, of wisdom. He
is on his guard, however, with respect to those who philosophize
according to the elements of this world, not according
to God, by whom the world itself was made; for he is warned
by the precept of the apostle, and faithfully hears what has
been said, "Beware that no one deceive you through philosophy
and vain deceit, according to the elements of the world."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
Then, that he may not suppose that all philosophers are such
as do this, he hears the same apostle say concerning certain
of them, "Because that which is known of God is manifest
among them, for God has manifested it to them. For His
invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things which are made, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
His eternal power and Godhead."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> And, when speaking to
the Athenians, after having spoken a mighty thing concerning
God, which few are able to understand, "In Him we live, and
move, and have our being,"<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> he goes on to say, "As certain
also of your own have said." He knows well, too, to be on
his guard against even these philosophers in their errors. For
where it has been said by him, "that God has manifested to
them by those things which are made His invisible things, that
they might be seen by the understanding," there it has also
been said that they did not rightly worship God Himself,
because they paid divine honours, which are due to Him
alone, to other things also to which they ought not to have
paid them,&mdash;"because, knowing God, they glorified Him not as
God; neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations,
and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing
themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the
glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image
of corruptible man, and of birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
creeping things;"<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>&mdash;where the apostle would have us
understand him as meaning the Romans, and Greeks, and
Egyptians, who gloried in the name of wisdom; but concerning
this we will dispute with them afterwards. With
respect, however, to that wherein they agree with us we
prefer them to all others, namely, concerning the one God,
the author of this universe, who is not only above every body,
being incorporeal, but also above all souls, being incorruptible&mdash;our
principle, our light, our good. And though the
Christian man, being ignorant of their writings, does not use
in disputation words which he has not learned,&mdash;not calling
that part of philosophy natural (which is the Latin term), or
physical (which is the Greek one), which treats of the investigation
of nature; or that part rational, or logical, which deals
with the question how truth may be discovered; or that part
moral, or ethical, which concerns morals, and shows how good
is to be sought, and evil to be shunned,&mdash;he is not, therefore,
ignorant that it is from the one true and supremely good God
that we have that nature in which we are made in the image
of God, and that doctrine by which we know Him and ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
and that grace through which, by cleaving to Him, we
are blessed. This, therefore, is the cause why we prefer these
to all the others, because, whilst other philosophers have worn
out their minds and powers in seeking the causes of things,
and endeavouring to discover the right mode of learning and
of living, these, by knowing God, have found where resides the
cause by which the universe has been constituted, and the
light by which truth is to be discovered, and the fountain at
which felicity is to be drunk. All philosophers, then, who
have had these thoughts concerning God, whether Platonists
or others, agree with us. But we have thought it better to
plead our cause with the Platonists, because their writings are
better known. For the Greeks, whose tongue holds the highest
place among the languages of the Gentiles, are loud in their
praises of these writings; and the Latins, taken with their
excellence, or their renown, have studied them more heartily
than other writings, and, by translating them into our tongue,
have given them greater celebrity and notoriety.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>How Plato has been able to approach so nearly to Christian knowledge.</i></p>

<p>Certain partakers with us in the grace of Christ, wonder
when they hear and read that Plato had conceptions concerning
God, in which they recognise considerable agreement with
the truth of our religion. Some have concluded from this,
that when he went to Egypt he had heard the prophet Jeremiah,
or, whilst travelling in the same country, had read the
prophetic scriptures, which opinion I myself have expressed
in certain of my writings.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> But a careful calculation of dates,
contained in chronological history, shows that Plato was born
about a hundred years after the time in which Jeremiah prophesied,
and, as he lived eighty-one years, there are found to
have been about seventy years from his death to that time
when Ptolemy, king of Egypt, requested the prophetic scriptures
of the Hebrew people to be sent to him from Judea,
and committed them to seventy Hebrews, who also knew the
Greek tongue, to be translated and kept. Therefore, on that
voyage of his, Plato could neither have seen Jeremiah, who
was dead so long before, nor have read those same scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
which had not yet been translated into the Greek language, of
which he was a master, unless, indeed, we say that, as he
was most earnest in the pursuit of knowledge, he also studied
those writings through an interpreter, as he did those of the
Egyptians,&mdash;not, indeed, writing a translation of them (the
facilities for doing which were only gained even by Ptolemy
in return for munificent acts of kindness,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> though fear of his
kingly authority might have seemed a sufficient motive), but
learning as much as he possibly could concerning their contents
by means of conversation. What warrants this supposition is
the opening verses of Genesis: "In the beginning God made
the heaven and earth. And the earth was invisible, and
without order; and darkness was over the abyss: and the
Spirit of God moved over the waters."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> For in the <i>Timæus</i>,
when writing on the formation of the world, he says that God
first united earth and fire; from which it is evident that he
assigns to fire a place in heaven. This opinion bears a certain
resemblance to the statement, "In the beginning God made
heaven and earth." Plato next speaks of those two intermediary
elements, water and air, by which the other two
extremes, namely, earth and fire, were mutually united;
from which circumstance he is thought to have so understood
the words, "The Spirit of God moved over the waters." For,
not paying sufficient attention to the designations given by
those scriptures to the Spirit of God, he may have thought
that the four elements are spoken of in that place, because
the air also is called spirit.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Then, as to Plato's saying that
the philosopher is a lover of God, nothing shines forth more
conspicuously in those sacred writings. But the most striking
thing in this connection, and that which most of all inclines
me almost to assent to the opinion that Plato was not ignorant
of those writings, is the answer which was given to the question
elicited from the holy Moses when the words of God
were conveyed to him by the angel; for, when he asked what
was the name of that God who was commanding him to go
and deliver the Hebrew people out of Egypt, this answer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
given: "I am who am; and thou shalt say to the children of
Israel, He who <i>is</i> sent me unto you;"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> as though compared
with Him that truly <i>is</i>, because He is unchangeable, those
things which have been created mutable <i>are</i> not,&mdash;a truth
which Plato vehemently held, and most diligently commended.
And I know not whether this sentiment is anywhere to be
found in the books of those who were before Plato, unless in
that book where it is said, "I am who am; and thou shalt
say to the children of Israel, <i>Who is</i> sent me unto you."</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>12. <i>That even the Platonists, though they say these things concerning the one
true God, nevertheless thought that sacred rites were to be performed in
honour of many gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But we need not determine from what source he learned
these things,&mdash;whether it was from the books of the ancients
who preceded him, or, as is more likely, from the words of
the apostle: "Because that which is known of God has been
manifested among them, for God hath manifested it to them.
For His invisible things from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by those things which have
been made, also His eternal power and Godhead."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> From
whatever source he may have derived this knowledge, then, I
think I have made it sufficiently plain that I have not chosen
the Platonic philosophers undeservedly as the parties with
whom to discuss; because the question we have just taken
up concerns the natural theology,&mdash;the question, namely,
whether sacred rites are to be performed to one God, or to
many, for the sake of the happiness which is to be after death.
I have specially chosen them because their juster thoughts
concerning the one God who made heaven and earth, have
made them illustrious among philosophers. This has given
them such superiority to all others in the judgment of posterity,
that, though Aristotle, the disciple of Plato, a man of
eminent abilities, inferior in eloquence to Plato, yet far superior
to many in that respect, had founded the Peripatetic sect,&mdash;so
called because they were in the habit of walking about during
their disputations,&mdash;and though he had, through the greatness
of his fame, gathered very many disciples into his school, even
during the life of his master; and though Plato at his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
was succeeded in his school, which was called the Academy,
by Speusippus, his sister's son, and Xenocrates, his beloved
disciple, who, together with their successors, were called from
this name of the school, Academics; nevertheless the most
illustrious recent philosophers, who have chosen to follow Plato,
have been unwilling to be called Peripatetics, or Academics,
but have preferred the name of Platonists. Among these
were the renowned Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, who
were Greeks, and the African Apuleius, who was learned both
in the Greek and Latin tongues. All these, however, and the
rest who were of the same school, and also Plato himself,
thought that sacred rites ought to be performed in honour of
many gods.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Concerning the opinion of Plato, according to which he defined the gods
as beings entirely good and the friends of virtue.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, although in many other important respects they
differ from us, nevertheless with respect to this particular
point of difference, which I have just stated, as it is one of
great moment, and the question on hand concerns it, I will
first ask them to what gods they think that sacred rites are
to be performed,&mdash;to the good or to the bad, or to both the
good and the bad? But we have the opinion of Plato affirming
that all the gods are good, and that there is not one of the
gods bad. It follows, therefore, that these are to be performed
to the good, for then they are performed to gods; for if they
are not good, neither are they gods. Now, if this be the case
(for what else ought we to believe concerning the gods?), certainly
it explodes the opinion that the bad gods are to be
propitiated by sacred rites in order that they may not harm
us, but the good gods are to be invoked in order that they
may assist us. For there are no bad gods, and it is to the
good that, as they say, the due honour of such rites is to
be paid. Of what character, then, are those gods who love
scenic displays, even demanding that a place be given them
among divine things, and that they be exhibited in their
honour? The power of these gods proves that they exist,
but their liking such things proves that they are bad. For it
is well known what Plato's opinion was concerning scenic
plays. He thinks that the poets themselves, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
have composed songs so unworthy of the majesty and goodness
of the gods, ought to be banished from the state. Of
what character, therefore, are those gods who contend with
Plato himself about those scenic plays? He does not suffer
the gods to be defamed by false crimes; the gods command
those same crimes to be celebrated in their own honour.</p>

<p>In fine, when they ordered these plays to be inaugurated,
they not only demanded base things, but also did cruel things,
taking from Titus Latinius his son, and sending a disease
upon him because he had refused to obey them, which they
removed when he had fulfilled their commands. Plato, however,
bad though they were, did not think they were to be
feared; but, holding to his opinion with the utmost firmness
and constancy, does not hesitate to remove from a well-ordered
state all the sacrilegious follies of the poets, with
which these gods are delighted because they themselves are
impure. But Labeo places this same Plato (as I have mentioned
already in the second book<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>) among the demi-gods.
Now Labeo thinks that the bad deities are to be propitiated
with bloody victims, and by fasts accompanied with the same,
but the good deities with plays, and all other things which
are associated with joyfulness. How comes it, then, that the
demi-god Plato so persistently dares to take away those pleasures,
because he deems them base, not from the demi-gods
but from the gods, and these the good gods? And, moreover,
those very gods themselves do certainly refute the opinion of
Labeo, for they showed themselves in the case of Latinius to
be not only wanton and sportive, but also cruel and terrible.
Let the Platonists, therefore, explain these things to us, since,
following the opinion of their master, they think that all the
gods are good and honourable, and friendly to the virtues of
the wise, holding it unlawful to think otherwise concerning
any of the gods. We will explain it, say they. Let us then
attentively listen to them.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>14. <i>Of the opinion of those who have said that rational souls are of three kinds,
to wit, those of the celestial gods, those of the aerial demons, and those of
terrestrial men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There is, say they, a threefold division of all animals endowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
with a rational soul, namely, into gods, men, and demons.
The gods occupy the loftiest region, men the lowest, the
demons the middle region. For the abode of the gods is
heaven, that of men the earth, that of the demons the air.
As the dignity of their regions is diverse, so also is that of
their natures; therefore the gods are better than men and
demons. Men have been placed below the gods and demons,
both in respect of the order of the regions they inhabit, and
the difference of their merits. The demons, therefore, who
hold the middle place, as they are inferior to the gods, than
whom they inhabit a lower region, so they are superior to
men, than whom they inhabit a loftier one. For they have
immortality of body in common with the gods, but passions of
the mind in common with men. On which account, say they,
it is not wonderful that they are delighted with the obscenities
of the theatre, and the fictions of the poets, since they are
also subject to human passions, from which the gods are far
removed, and to which they are altogether strangers. Whence
we conclude that it was not the gods, who are all good and
highly exalted, that Plato deprived of the pleasure of theatric
plays, by reprobating and prohibiting the fictions of the poets,
but the demons.</p>

<p>Of these things many have written: among others Apuleius,
the Platonist of Madaura, who composed a whole work on the
subject, entitled, <i>Concerning the God of Socrates</i>. He there
discusses and explains of what kind that deity was who attended
on Socrates, a sort of familiar, by whom it is said he
was admonished to desist from any action which would not
turn out to his advantage. He asserts most distinctly, and
proves at great length, that it was not a god but a demon;
and he discusses with great diligence the opinion of Plato
concerning the lofty estate of the gods, the lowly estate of men,
and the middle estate of demons. These things being so,
how did Plato dare to take away, if not from the gods, whom
he removed from all human contagion, certainly from the
demons, all the pleasures of the theatre, by expelling the poets
from the state? Evidently in this way he wished to admonish
the human soul, although still confined in these moribund
members, to despise the shameful commands of the demons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
and to detest their impurity, and to choose rather the splendour
of virtue. But if Plato showed himself virtuous in
answering and prohibiting these things, then certainly it was
shameful of the demons to command them. Therefore either
Apuleius is wrong, and Socrates' familiar did not belong to
this class of deities, or Plato held contradictory opinions, now
honouring the demons, now removing from the well-regulated
state the things in which they delighted, or Socrates is not to
be congratulated on the friendship of the demon, of which
Apuleius was so ashamed that he entitled his book <i>On the
God of Socrates</i>, whilst according to the tenor of his discussion,
wherein he so diligently and at such length distinguishes
gods from demons, he ought not to have entitled it, <i>Concerning
the God</i>, but <i>Concerning the Demon of Socrates</i>. But he
preferred to put this into the discussion itself rather than into
the title of his book. For, through the sound doctrine which
has illuminated human society, all, or almost all men have
such a horror at the name of demons, that every one who,
before reading the dissertation of Apuleius, which sets forth
the dignity of demons, should have read the title of the book,
<i>On the Demon of Socrates</i>, would certainly have thought that
the author was not a sane man. But what did even Apuleius
find to praise in the demons, except subtlety and strength of
body and a higher place of habitation? For when he spoke
generally concerning their manners, he said nothing that was
good, but very much that was bad. Finally, no one, when he
has read that book, wonders that they desired to have even
the obscenity of the stage among divine things, or that, wishing
to be thought gods, they should be delighted with the
crimes of the gods, or that all those sacred solemnities, whose
obscenity occasions laughter, and whose shameful cruelty causes
horror, should be in agreement with their passions.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>That the demons are not better than men because of their aerial bodies,
or on account of their superior place of abode.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore let not the mind truly religious, and submitted
to the true God, suppose that demons are better than men,
because they have better bodies. Otherwise it must put
many beasts before itself which are superior to us both in
acuteness of the senses, in ease and quickness of movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
in strength and in long-continued vigour of body. What
man can equal the eagle or the vulture in strength of vision?
Who can equal the dog in acuteness of smell? Who can
equal the hare, the stag, and all the birds in swiftness? Who
can equal in strength the lion or the elephant? Who can
equal in length of life the serpents, which are affirmed to
put off old age along with their skin, and to return to youth
again? But as we are better than all these by the possession
of reason and understanding, so we ought also to be better
than the demons by living good and virtuous lives. For
divine providence gave to them bodies of a better quality
than ours, that that in which we excel them might in this
way be commended to us as deserving to be far more cared
for than the body, and that we should learn to despise the
bodily excellence of the demons compared with goodness of
life, in respect of which we are better than they, knowing that
we too shall have immortality of body,&mdash;not an immortality
tortured by eternal punishment, but that which is consequent
on purity of soul.</p>

<p>But now, as regards loftiness of place, it is altogether ridiculous
to be so influenced by the fact that the demons inhabit
the air, and we the earth, as to think that on that account
they are to be put before us; for in this way we put all the
birds before ourselves. But the birds, when they are weary
with flying, or require to repair their bodies with food, come
back to the earth to rest or to feed, which the demons, they
say, do not. Are they, therefore, inclined to say that the
birds are superior to us, and the demons superior to the birds?
But if it be madness to think so, there is no reason why we
should think that, on account of their inhabiting a loftier
element, the demons have a claim to our religious submission.
But as it is really the case that the birds of the air are not
only not put before us who dwell on the earth, but are even
subjected to us on account of the dignity of the rational soul
which is in us, so also it is the case that the demons, though
they are aerial, are not better than we who are terrestrial
because the air is higher than the earth, but, on the contrary,
men are to be put before demons because their despair is not
to be compared to the hope of pious men. Even that law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Plato's, according to which he mutually orders and arranges
the four elements, inserting between the two extreme elements&mdash;namely,
fire, which is in the highest degree mobile, and the
immoveable earth&mdash;the two middle ones, air and water, that
by how much the air is higher up than the water, and the fire
than the air, by so much also are the waters higher than
the earth,&mdash;this law, I say, sufficiently admonishes us not to
estimate the merits of animated creatures according to the
grades of the elements. And Apuleius himself says that man
is a terrestrial animal in common with the rest, who is nevertheless
to be put far before aquatic animals, though Plato puts
the waters themselves before the land. By this he would
have us understand that the same order is not to be observed
when the question concerns the merits of animals, though it
seems to be the true one in the gradation of bodies; for it
appears to be possible that a soul of a higher order may inhabit
a body of a lower, and a soul of a lower order a body
of a higher.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>What Apuleius the Platonist thought concerning the manners and
actions of demons.</i></p>

<p>The same Apuleius, when speaking concerning the manners
of demons, said that they are agitated with the same perturbations
of mind as men; that they are provoked by injuries,
propitiated by services and by gifts, rejoice in honours, are
delighted with a variety of sacred rites, and are annoyed if
any of them be neglected. Among other things, he also says
that on them depend the divinations of augurs, soothsayers,
and prophets, and the revelations of dreams; and that from
them also are the miracles of the magicians. But, when
giving a brief definition of them, he says, "Demons are of an
animal nature, passive in soul, rational in mind, aerial in body,
eternal in time." "Of which five things, the three first are
common to them and us, the fourth peculiar to themselves,
and the fifth common to them with the gods."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> But I see
that they have in common with the gods two of the first things,
which they have in common with us. For he says that the
gods also are animals; and when he is assigning to every
order of beings its own element, he places us among the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
terrestrial animals which live and feel upon the earth. Wherefore,
if the demons are animals as to genus, this is common to
them, not only with men, but also with the gods and with
beasts; if they are rational as to their mind, this is common
to them with the gods and with men; if they are eternal in
time, this is common to them with the gods only; if they are
passive as to their soul, this is common to them with men
only; if they are aerial in body, in this they are alone. Therefore
it is no great thing for them to be of an animal nature,
for so also are the beasts; in being rational as to mind, they
are not above ourselves, for so are we also; and as to their
being eternal as to time, what is the advantage of that if
they are not blessed? for better is temporal happiness than
eternal misery. Again, as to their being passive in soul, how
are they in this respect above us, since we also are so, but
would not have been so had we not been miserable? Also,
as to their being aerial in body, how much value is to be set
on that, since a soul of any kind whatsoever is to be set above
every body? and therefore religious worship, which ought to
be rendered from the soul, is by no means due to that thing
which is inferior to the soul. Moreover, if he had, among
those things which he says belong to demons, enumerated
virtue, wisdom, happiness, and affirmed that they have those
things in common with the gods, and, like them, eternally, he
would assuredly have attributed to them something greatly to
be desired, and much to be prized. And even in that case it
would not have been our duty to worship them like God on
account of these things, but rather to worship Him from whom
we know they had received them. But how much less are
they really worthy of divine honour,&mdash;those aerial animals who
are only rational that they may be capable of misery, passive
that they may be actually miserable, and eternal that it may
be impossible for them to end their misery!</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Whether it is proper that men should worship those spirits from whose
vices it is necessary that they be freed.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore, to omit other things, and confine our attention
to that which he says is common to the demons with us, let us
ask this question: If all the four elements are full of their own
animals, the fire and the air of immortal, and the water and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
earth of mortal ones, why are the souls of demons agitated by
the whirlwinds and tempests of passions?&mdash;for the Greek word
&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962; means perturbation, whence he chose to call the demons
"passive in soul," because the word passion, which is derived
from &#960;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962;, signified a commotion of the mind contrary to
reason. Why, then, are these things in the minds of demons
which are not in beasts? For if anything of this kind appears
in beasts, it is not perturbation, because it is not contrary to
reason, of which they are devoid. Now it is foolishness or
misery which is the cause of these perturbations in the case of
men, for we are not yet blessed in the possession of that perfection
of wisdom which is promised to us at last, when we
shall be set free from our present mortality. But the gods,
they say, are free from these perturbations, because they are
not only eternal, but also blessed; for they also have the same
kind of rational souls, but most pure from all spot and plague.
Wherefore, if the gods are free from perturbation because they
are blessed, not miserable animals, and the beasts are free
from them because they are animals which are capable neither
of blessedness nor misery, it remains that the demons, like
men, are subject to perturbations because they are not blessed
but miserable animals. What folly, therefore, or rather what
madness, to submit ourselves through any sentiment of religion
to demons, when it belongs to the true religion to deliver us
from that depravity which makes us like to them! For
Apuleius himself, although he is very sparing toward them,
and thinks they are worthy of divine honours, is nevertheless
compelled to confess that they are subject to anger; and the
true religion commands us not to be moved with anger, but
rather to resist it. The demons are won over by gifts; and
the true religion commands us to favour no one on account of
gifts received. The demons are flattered by honours; but the
true religion commands us by no means to be moved by such
things. The demons are haters of some men and lovers of
others, not in consequence of a prudent and calm judgment,
but because of what he calls their "passive soul;" whereas the
true religion commands us to love even our enemies. Lastly,
the true religion commands us to put away all disquietude
of heart, and agitation of mind, and also all commotions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
tempests of the soul, which Apuleius asserts to be continually
swelling and surging in the souls of demons. Why, therefore,
except through foolishness and miserable error, shouldst thou
humble thyself to worship a being to whom thou desirest to
be unlike in thy life? And why shouldst thou pay religious
homage to him whom thou art unwilling to imitate, when it
is the highest duty of religion to imitate Him whom thou worshippest?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>18. <i>What kind of religion that is which teaches that men ought to employ the
advocacy of demons in order to be recommended to the favour of the good
gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In vain, therefore, have Apuleius, and they who think with
him, conferred on the demons the honour of placing them in
the air, between the ethereal heavens and the earth, that they
may carry to the gods the prayers of men, to men the answers of
the gods; for Plato held, they say, that no god has intercourse
with man. They who believe these things have thought it unbecoming
that men should have intercourse with the gods, and
the gods with men, but a befitting thing that the demons
should have intercourse with both gods and men, presenting to
the gods the petitions of men, and conveying to men what the
gods have granted; so that a chaste man, and one who is a
stranger to the crimes of the magic arts, must use as patrons,
through whom the gods may be induced to hear him, demons
who love these crimes, although the very fact of his not loving
them ought to have recommended him to them as one who
deserved to be listened to with greater readiness and willingness
on their part. They love the abominations of the stage,
which chastity does not love. They love, in the sorceries of
the magicians, "<i>a thousand arts of inflicting harm</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> which innocence
does not love. Yet both chastity and innocence, if
they wish to obtain anything from the gods, will not be able
to do so by their own merits, except their enemies act as
mediators on their behalf. Apuleius need not attempt to
justify the fictions of the poets, and the mockeries of the stage.
If human modesty can act so faithlessly towards itself as not
only to love shameful things, but even to think that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
pleasing to the divinity, we can cite on the other side their
own highest authority and teacher, Plato.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the impiety of the magic art, which is dependent on the assistance
of malign spirits.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, against those magic arts, concerning which some
men, exceedingly wretched and exceedingly impious, delight
to boast, may not public opinion itself be brought forward as
a witness? For why are those arts so severely punished by
the laws, if they are the works of deities who ought to be
worshipped? Shall it be said that the Christians have ordained
those laws by which magic arts are punished? With what
other meaning, except that these sorceries are without doubt
pernicious to the human race, did the most illustrious poet
say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By heaven, I swear, and your dear life,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Unwillingly these arms I wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And take, to meet the coming strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Enchantment's sword and shield."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And that also which he says in another place concerning
magic arts,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I've seen him to another place transport the standing corn,"<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>has reference to the fact that the fruits of one field are said to
be transferred to another by these arts which this pestiferous
and accursed doctrine teaches. Does not Cicero inform us that,
among the laws of the Twelve Tables, that is, the most ancient
laws of the Romans, there was a law written which appointed
a punishment to be inflicted on him who should do this?<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
Lastly, was it before Christian judges that Apuleius himself
was accused of magic arts?<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Had he known these arts to be
divine and pious, and congruous with the works of divine
power, he ought not only to have confessed, but also to have
professed them, rather blaming the laws by which these things
were prohibited and pronounced worthy of condemnation, while
they ought to have been held worthy of admiration and respect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
For by so doing, either he would have persuaded the judges to
adopt his own opinion, or, if they had shown their partiality
for unjust laws, and condemned him to death notwithstanding
his praising and commending such things, the demons would
have bestowed on his soul such rewards as he deserved, who,
in order to proclaim and set forth their divine works, had not
feared the loss of his human life. As our martyrs, when that
religion was charged on them as a crime, by which they knew
they were made safe and most glorious throughout eternity,
did not choose, by denying it, to escape temporal punishments,
but rather by confessing, professing, and proclaiming it, by
enduring all things for it with fidelity and fortitude, and by
dying for it with pious calmness, put to shame the law by
which that religion was prohibited, and caused its revocation.
But there is extant a most copious and eloquent oration of
this Platonic philosopher, in which he defends himself against
the charge of practising these arts, affirming that he is wholly
a stranger to them, and only wishing to show his innocence
by denying such things as cannot be innocently committed.
But all the miracles of the magicians, who he thinks are justly
deserving of condemnation, are performed according to the
teaching and by the power of demons. Why, then, does he
think that they ought to be honoured? For he asserts that
they are necessary, in order to present our prayers to the gods,
and yet their works are such as we must shun if we wish our
prayers to reach the true God. Again, I ask, what kind of
prayers of men does he suppose are presented to the good
gods by the demons? If magical prayers, they will have none
such; if lawful prayers, they will not receive them through
such beings. But if a sinner who is penitent pour out prayers,
especially if he has committed any crime of sorcery, does he
receive pardon through the intercession of those demons by
whose instigation and help he has fallen into the sin he mourns?
or do the demons themselves, in order that they may merit
pardon for the penitent, first become penitents because they
have deceived them? This no one ever said concerning the
demons; for had this been the case, they would never have
dared to seek for themselves divine honours. For how should
they do so who desired by penitence to obtain the grace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
pardon, seeing that such detestable pride could not exist along
with a humility worthy of pardon?</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Whether we are to believe that the good gods are more willing to have
intercourse with demons than with men.</i></p>

<p>But does any urgent and most pressing cause compel the
demons to mediate between the gods and men, that they may
offer the prayers of men, and bring back the answers from the
gods? and if so, what, pray, is that cause, what is that so
great necessity? Because, say they, no god has intercourse
with man. Most admirable holiness of God, which has no
intercourse with a supplicating man, and yet has intercourse
with an arrogant demon! which has no intercourse with a
penitent man, and yet has intercourse with a deceiving demon!
which has no intercourse with a man fleeing for refuge to the
divine nature, and yet has intercourse with a demon feigning
divinity! which has no intercourse with a man seeking pardon,
and yet has intercourse with a demon persuading to wickedness!
which has no intercourse with a man expelling the
poets by means of philosophical writings from a well-regulated
state, and yet has intercourse with a demon requesting
from the princes and priests of a state the theatrical performance
of the mockeries of the poets! which has no intercourse
with the man who prohibits the ascribing of crime to the
gods, and yet has intercourse with a demon who takes delight
in the fictitious representation of their crimes! which has no
intercourse with a man punishing the crimes of the magicians
by just laws, and yet has intercourse with a demon teaching
and practising magical arts! which has no intercourse with a
man shunning the imitation of a demon, and yet has intercourse
with a demon lying in wait for the deception of a
man!</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Whether the gods use the demons as messengers and interpreters, and whether
they are deceived by them willingly, or without their own knowledge.</i></p>

<p>But herein, no doubt, lies the great necessity for this
absurdity, so unworthy of the gods, that the ethereal gods,
who are concerned about human affairs, would not know what
terrestrial men were doing unless the aerial demons should
bring them intelligence, because the ether is suspended far
away from the earth and far above it, but the air is contiguous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
both to the ether and to the earth. O admirable wisdom!
what else do these men think concerning the gods who, they
say, are all in the highest degree good, but that they are
concerned about human affairs, lest they should seem unworthy
of worship, whilst, on the other hand, from the
distance between the elements, they are ignorant of terrestrial
things? It is on this account that they have supposed
the demons to be necessary as agents, through whom the
gods may inform themselves with respect to human affairs,
and through whom, when necessary, they may succour men;
and it is on account of this office that the demons themselves
have been held as deserving of worship. If this be the case,
then a demon is better known by these good gods through
nearness of body, than a man is by goodness of mind. O
mournful necessity! or shall I not rather say detestable and
vain error, that I may not impute vanity to the divine nature!
For if the gods can, with their minds free from the hindrance
of bodies, see our mind, they do not need the demons as
messengers from our mind to them; but if the ethereal gods,
by means of their bodies, perceive the corporeal indices of
minds, as the countenance, speech, motion, and thence understand
what the demons tell them, then it is also possible that
they may be deceived by the falsehoods of demons. Moreover,
if the divinity of the gods cannot be deceived by the demons,
neither can it be ignorant of our actions. But I would they
would tell me whether the demons have informed the gods
that the fictions of the poets concerning the crimes of the
gods displease Plato, concealing the pleasure which they themselves
take in them; or whether they have concealed both, and
have preferred that the gods should be ignorant with respect
to this whole matter, or have told both, as well the pious
prudence of Plato with respect to the gods as their own lust,
which is injurious to the gods; or whether they have concealed
Plato's opinion, according to which he was unwilling that the
gods should be defamed with falsely alleged crimes through
the impious licence of the poets, whilst they have not been
ashamed nor afraid to make known their own wickedness,
which make them love theatrical plays, in which the infamous
deeds of the gods are celebrated. Let them choose which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
they will of these four alternatives, and let them consider how
much evil any one of them would require them to think of the
gods. For if they choose the first, they must then confess that
it was not possible for the good gods to dwell with the good
Plato, though he sought to prohibit things injurious to them,
whilst they dwelt with evil demons, who exulted in their
injuries; and this because they suppose that the good gods
can only know a good man, placed at so great a distance from
them, through the mediation of evil demons, whom they could
know on account of their nearness to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> If they
shall choose the second, and shall say that both these things
are concealed by the demons, so that the gods are wholly
ignorant both of Plato's most religious law and the sacrilegious
pleasure of the demons, what, in that case, can the
gods know to any profit with respect to human affairs through
these mediating demons, when they do not know those things
which are decreed, through the piety of good men, for the
honour of the good gods against the lust of evil demons?
But if they shall choose the third, and reply that these intermediary
demons have communicated, not only the opinion
of Plato, which prohibited wrongs to be done to the gods,
but also their own delight in these wrongs, I would ask if
such a communication is not rather an insult? Now the
gods, hearing both and knowing both, not only permit the
approach of those malign demons, who desire and do things
contrary to the dignity of the gods and the religion of Plato,
but also, through these wicked demons, who are near to them,
send good things to the good Plato, who is far away from
them; for they inhabit such a place in the concatenated
series of the elements, that they can come into contact with
those by whom they are accused, but not with him by whom
they are defended,&mdash;knowing the truth on both sides, but not
being able to change the weight of the air and the earth.
There remains the fourth supposition; but it is worse than the
rest. For who will suffer it to be said that the demons have
made known the calumnious fictions of the poets concerning
the immortal gods, and also the disgraceful mockeries of the
theatres, and their own most ardent lust after, and most sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
pleasure in these things, whilst they have concealed from
them that Plato, with the gravity of a philosopher, gave it as
his opinion that all these things ought to be removed from a
well-regulated republic; so that the good gods are now compelled,
through such messengers, to know the evil doings of
the most wicked beings, that is to say, of the messengers
themselves, and are not allowed to know the good deeds of
the philosophers, though the former are for the injury, but
these latter for the honour of the gods themselves?</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>That we must, notwithstanding the opinion of Apuleius, reject the worship
of demons.</i></p>

<p>None of these four alternatives, then, is to be chosen; for
we dare not suppose such unbecoming things concerning the
gods as the adoption of any one of them would lead us to
think. It remains, therefore, that no credence whatever is to
be given to the opinion of Apuleius and the other philosophers
of the same school, namely, that the demons act as messengers
and interpreters between the gods and men to carry our petitions
from us to the gods, and to bring back to us the help of
the gods. On the contrary, we must believe them to be spirits
most eager to inflict harm, utterly alien from righteousness,
swollen with pride, pale with envy, subtle in deceit; who dwell
indeed in this air as in a prison, in keeping with their own
character, because, cast down from the height of the higher
heaven, they have been condemned to dwell in this element
as the just reward of irretrievable transgression. But, though
the air is situated above the earth and the waters, they are
not on that account superior in merit to men, who, though
they do not surpass them as far as their earthly bodies are
concerned, do nevertheless far excel them through piety of
mind,&mdash;they having made choice of the true God as their
helper. Over many, however, who are manifestly unworthy of
participation in the true religion, they tyrannize as over captives
whom they have subdued,&mdash;the greatest part of whom
they have persuaded of their divinity by wonderful and lying
signs, consisting either of deeds or of predictions. Some,
nevertheless, who have more attentively and diligently considered
their vices, they have not been able to persuade that
they are gods, and so have feigned themselves to be messengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
between the gods and men. Some, indeed, have thought that
not even this latter honour ought to be acknowledged as
belonging to them, not believing that they were gods, because
they saw that they were wicked, whereas the gods, according
to their view, are all good. Nevertheless they dared not say
that they were wholly unworthy of all divine honour, for
fear of offending the multitude, by whom, through inveterate
superstition, the demons were served by the performance of
many rites, and the erection of many temples.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>What Hermes Trismegistus thought concerning idolatry, and from what
source he knew that the superstitions of Egypt were to be abolished.</i></p>

<p>The Egyptian Hermes, whom they call Trismegistus, had
a different opinion concerning those demons. Apuleius,
indeed, denies that they are gods; but when he says that
they hold a middle place between the gods and men, so that
they seem to be necessary for men as mediators between them
and the gods, he does not distinguish between the worship
due to them and the religious homage due to the supernal
gods. This Egyptian, however, says that there are some gods
made by the supreme God, and some made by men. Any
one who hears this, as I have stated it, no doubt supposes
that it has reference to images, because they are the works
of the hands of men; but he asserts that visible and tangible
images are, as it were, only the bodies of the gods, and that
there dwell in them certain spirits, which have been invited
to come into them, and which have power to inflict harm, or
to fulfil the desires of those by whom divine honours and
services are rendered to them. To unite, therefore, by a
certain art, those invisible spirits to visible and material
things, so as to make, as it were, animated bodies, dedicated
and given up to those spirits who inhabit them,&mdash;this,
he says, is to make gods, adding that men have received
this great and wonderful power. I will give the
words of this Egyptian as they have been translated into
our tongue: "And, since we have undertaken to discourse
concerning the relationship and fellowship between men
and the gods, know, O Æsculapius, the power and strength
of man. As the Lord and Father, or that which is highest,
even God, is the maker of the celestial gods, so man is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
maker of the gods who are in the temples, content to dwell
near to men."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> And a little after he says, "Thus humanity,
always mindful of its nature and origin, perseveres in the
imitation of divinity; and as the Lord and Father made
eternal gods, that they should be like Himself, so humanity
fashioned its own gods according to the likeness of its own
countenance." When this Æsculapius, to whom especially
he was speaking, had answered him, and had said, "Dost thou
mean the statues, O Trismegistus?"&mdash;"Yes, the statues," replied
he, "however unbelieving thou art, O Æsculapius,&mdash;the statues,
animated, and full of sensation and spirit, and who do such
great and wonderful things,&mdash;the statues, prescient of future
things, and foretelling them by lot, by prophet, by dreams, and
many other things, who bring diseases on men and cure
them again, giving them joy or sorrow according to their
merits. Dost thou not know, Æsculapius, that Egypt is an
image of heaven, or, more truly, a translation and descent of all
things which are ordered and transacted there,&mdash;that it is, in
truth, if we may say so, to be the temple of the whole world?
And yet, as it becomes the prudent man to know all things
beforehand, ye ought not to be ignorant of this, that there is
a time coming when it shall appear that the Egyptians have
all in vain, with pious mind, and with most scrupulous diligence,
waited on the divinity, and when all their holy worship
shall come to nought, and be found to be in vain."</p>

<p>Hermes then follows out at great length the statements of
this passage, in which he seems to predict the present time, in
which the Christian religion is overthrowing all lying figments
with a vehemence and liberty proportioned to its superior truth
and holiness, in order that the grace of the true Saviour may
deliver men from those gods which man has made, and subject
them to that God by whom man was made. But when
Hermes predicts these things, he speaks as one who is a
friend to these same mockeries of demons, and does not
clearly express the name of Christ. On the contrary, he
deplores, as if it had already taken place, the future abolition
of those things by the observance of which there was maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
in Egypt a resemblance of heaven,&mdash;he bears witness to
Christianity by a kind of mournful prophecy. Now it was
with reference to such that the apostle said, that "knowing
God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful,
but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart
was darkened; professing themselves to be wise, they became
fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the
likeness of the image of corruptible man,"<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and so on, for the
whole passage is too long to quote. For Hermes makes many
such statements agreeable to the truth concerning the one
true God who fashioned this world. And I know not how
he has become so bewildered by that "darkening of the heart"
as to stumble into the expression of a desire that men should
always continue in subjection to those gods which he confesses
to be made by men, and to bewail their future removal;
as if there could be anything more wretched than mankind
tyrannized over by the work of his own hands, since man,
by worshipping the works of his own hands, may more easily
cease to be man, than the works of his hands can, through his
worship of them, become gods. For it can sooner happen
that man, who has received an honourable position, may,
through lack of understanding, become comparable to the
beasts, than that the works of man may become preferable to
the work of God, made in His own image, that is, to man
himself. Wherefore deservedly is man left to fall away from
Him who made him, when he prefers to himself that which
he himself has made.</p>

<p>For these vain, deceitful, pernicious, sacrilegious things did
the Egyptian Hermes sorrow, because he knew that the time
was coming when they should be removed. But his sorrow
was as impudently expressed as his knowledge was imprudently
obtained; for it was not the Holy Spirit who revealed these
things to him, as He had done to the holy prophets, who, foreseeing
these things, said with exultation, "If a man shall make
gods, lo, they are no gods;"<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and in another place, "And it shall
come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off
the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more
be remembered."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> But the holy Isaiah prophesies expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
concerning Egypt in reference to this matter, saying, "And the
idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence, and their heart
shall be overcome in them,"<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and other things to the same effect.
And with the prophet are to be classed those who rejoiced that
that which they knew was to come had actually come,&mdash;as
Simeon, or Anna, who immediately recognised Jesus when He
was born, or Elisabeth, who in the Spirit recognised Him
when He was conceived, or Peter, who said by the revelation
of the Father, "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
But to this Egyptian those spirits indicated the time of their
own destruction, who also, when the Lord was present in the
flesh, said with trembling, "Art Thou come hither to destroy
us before the time?"<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> meaning by destruction before the time,
either that very destruction which they expected to come,
but which they did not think would come so suddenly as it
appeared to have done, or only that destruction which consisted
in their being brought into contempt by being made
known. And, indeed, this was a destruction before the time,
that is, before the time of judgment, when they are to be
punished with eternal damnation, together with all men who
are implicated in their wickedness, as the true religion declares,
which neither errs nor leads into error; for it is not
like him who, blown hither and thither by every wind of
doctrine, and mixing true things with things which are false,
bewails as about to perish a religion which he afterwards
confesses to be error.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>How Hermes openly confessed the error of his forefathers, the coming
destruction of which he nevertheless bewailed.</i></p>

<p>After a long interval, Hermes again comes back to the
subject of the gods which men have made, saying as follows:
"But enough on this subject. Let us return to man and to
reason, that divine gift on account of which man has been
called a rational animal. For the things which have been
said concerning man, wonderful though they are, are less
wonderful than those which have been said concerning reason.
For man to discover the divine nature, and to make it, surpasses
the wonder of all other wonderful things. Because,
therefore, our forefathers erred very far with respect to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
knowledge of the gods, through incredulity and through want
of attention to their worship and service, they invented this
art of making gods; and this art once invented, they associated
with it a suitable virtue borrowed from universal nature, and,
being incapable of making souls, they evoked those of demons
or of angels, and united them with these holy images and
divine mysteries, in order that through these souls the images
might have power to do good or harm to men." I know not
whether the demons themselves could have been made, even
by adjuration, to confess as he has confessed in these words:
"Because our forefathers erred very far with respect to the
knowledge of the gods, through incredulity and through want
of attention to their worship and service, they invented the
art of making gods." Does he say that it was a moderate
degree of error which resulted in their discovery of the art
of making gods, or was he content to say "they erred?" No;
he must needs add "very far," and say, "<i>They erred very far.</i>"
It was this great error and incredulity, then, of their forefathers
who did not attend to the worship and service of the
gods, which was the origin of the art of making gods. And
yet this wise man grieves over the ruin of this art at some
future time, as if it were a divine religion. Is he not verily
compelled by divine influence, on the one hand, to reveal the
past error of his forefathers, and by a diabolical influence, on
the other hand, to bewail the future punishment of demons?
For if their forefathers, by erring very far with respect to
the knowledge of the gods, through incredulity and aversion
of mind from their worship and service, invented the art of
making gods, what wonder is it that all that is done by this
detestable art, which is opposed to the divine religion, should
be taken away by that religion, when truth corrects error,
faith refutes incredulity, and conversion rectifies aversion?</p>

<p>For if he had only said, without mentioning the cause, that
his forefathers had discovered the art of making gods, it would
have been our duty, if we paid any regard to what is right
and pious, to consider and to see that they could never have
attained to this art if they had not erred from the truth, if
they had believed those things which are worthy of God, if
they had attended to divine worship and service. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
if we alone should say that the causes of this art were to be
found in the great error and incredulity of men, and aversion
of the mind erring from and unfaithful to divine religion, the
impudence of those who resist the truth were in some way
to be borne with; but when he who admires in man, above
all other things, this power which it has been granted him to
practise, and sorrows because a time is coming when all those
figments of gods invented by men shall even be commanded
by the laws to be taken away,&mdash;when even this man confesses
nevertheless, and explains the causes which led to the
discovery of this art, saying that their ancestors, through great
error and incredulity, and through not attending to the worship
and service of the gods, invented this art of making gods,&mdash;what
ought we to say, or rather to do, but to give to the
Lord our God all the thanks we are able, because He has
taken away those things by causes the contrary of those
which led to their institution? For that which the prevalence
of error instituted, the way of truth took away; that
which incredulity instituted, faith took away; that which
aversion from divine worship and service instituted, conversion
to the one true and holy God took away. Nor was this
the case only in Egypt, for which country alone the spirit of
the demons lamented in Hermes, but in all the earth, which
sings to the Lord a new song,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> as the truly holy and truly
prophetic Scriptures have predicted, in which it is written,
"Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the
earth." For the title of this psalm is, "When the house
was built after the captivity." For a house is being built
to the Lord in all the earth, even the city of God, which
is the holy Church, after that captivity in which demons
held captive those men who, through faith in God, became
living stones in the house. For although man made gods, it
did not follow that he who made them was not held captive
by them, when, by worshipping them, he was drawn into
fellowship with them,&mdash;into the fellowship not of stolid idols,
but of cunning demons; for what are idols but what they
are represented to be in the same Scriptures, "They have eyes,
but they do not see,"<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and, though artistically fashioned, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
still without life and sensation? But unclean spirits, associated
through that wicked art with these same idols, have
miserably taken captive the souls of their worshippers, by
bringing them down into fellowship with themselves. Whence
the apostle says, "We know that an idol is nothing, but
those things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to
demons, and not to God; and I would not ye should have
fellowship with demons."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> After this captivity, therefore, in
which men were held by malign demons, the house of God
is being built in all the earth; whence the title of that psalm
in which it is said, "Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing
unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, bless His
name; declare well His salvation from day to day. Declare
His glory among the nations, among all people His wonderful
things. For great is the Lord, and much to be praised: He is
terrible above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are
demons: but the Lord made the heavens."<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Wherefore he who sorrowed because a time was coming when
the worship of idols should be abolished, and the domination of
the demons over those who worshipped them, wished, under the
influence of a demon, that that captivity should always continue,
at the cessation of which that psalm celebrates the building of
the house of the Lord in all the earth. Hermes foretold these
things with grief, the prophet with joyfulness; and because
the Spirit is victorious who sang these things through the
ancient prophets, even Hermes himself was compelled in a
wonderful manner to confess, that those very things which
he wished not to be removed, and at the prospect of whose
removal he was sorrowful, had been instituted, not by prudent,
faithful, and religious, but by erring and unbelieving men,
averse to the worship and service of the gods. And although
he calls them gods, nevertheless, when he says that they were
made by such men as we certainly ought not to be, he shows,
whether he will or not, that they are not to be worshipped by
those who do not resemble these image-makers, that is, by prudent,
faithful, and religious men, at the same time also making
it manifest that the very men who made them involved themselves
in the worship of those as gods who were not gods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
For true is the saying of the prophet, "If a man <i>make</i> gods,
lo, they are no gods."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Such gods, therefore, acknowledged
by such worshippers and made by such men, did Hermes call
"gods made by men," that is to say, demons, through some
art of I know not what description, bound by the chains of
their own lusts to images. But, nevertheless, he did not
agree with that opinion of the Platonic Apuleius, of which
we have already shown the incongruity and absurdity, namely,
that they were interpreters and intercessors between the gods
whom God made, and men whom the same God made, bringing
to God the prayers of men, and from God the gifts given in
answer to these prayers. For it is exceedingly stupid to
believe that gods whom men have made have more influence
with gods whom God has made than men themselves have,
whom the very same God has made. And consider, too, that
it is a demon which, bound by a man to an image by means
of an impious art, has been made a god, but a god to such a
man only, not to every man. What kind of god, therefore, is
that which no man would make but one erring, incredulous,
and averse to the true God? Moreover, if the demons which
are worshipped in the temples, being introduced by some kind
of strange art into images, that is, into visible representations
of themselves, by those men who by this art made gods when
they were straying away from, and were averse to the worship
and service of the gods,&mdash;if, I say, those demons are neither
mediators nor interpreters between men and the gods, both
on account of their own most wicked and base manners, and
because men, though erring, incredulous, and averse from the
worship and service of the gods, are nevertheless beyond
doubt better than the demons whom they themselves have
evoked, then it remains to be affirmed that what power they
possess they possess as demons, doing harm by bestowing
pretended benefits,&mdash;harm all the greater for the deception,&mdash;or
else openly and undisguisedly doing evil to men. They cannot,
however, do anything of this kind unless where they are permitted
by the deep and secret providence of God, and then
only so far as they are permitted. When, however, they are
permitted, it is not because they, being midway between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
men and the gods, have through the friendship of the gods
great power over men; for these demons cannot possibly be
friends to the good gods who dwell in the holy and heavenly
habitation, by whom we mean holy angels and rational creatures,
whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or
powers, from whom they are as far separated in disposition
and character as vice is distant from virtue, wickedness from
goodness.</p>

<p>Wherefore we must by no means seek, through the supposed
mediation of demons, to avail ourselves of the benevolence or
beneficence of the gods, or rather of the good angels, but
through resembling them in the possession of a good will,
through which we are with them, and live with them, and
worship with them the same God, although we cannot see
them with the eyes of our flesh. But it is not in locality
we are distant from them, but in merit of life, caused by our
miserable unlikeness to them in will, and by the weakness
of our character; for the mere fact of our dwelling on earth
under the conditions of life in the flesh does not prevent our
fellowship with them. It is only prevented when we, in the
impurity of our hearts, mind earthly things. But in this
present time, while we are being healed that we may eventually
be as they are, we are brought near to them by faith, if
by their assistance we believe that He who is their blessedness
is also ours.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That all the religion of the pagans has reference to dead men.</i></p>

<p>It is certainly a remarkable thing how this Egyptian, when
expressing his grief that a time was coming when those things
would be taken away from Egypt, which he confesses to have
been invented by men erring, incredulous, and averse to the
service of divine religion, says, among other things, "Then
shall that land, the most holy place of shrines and temples,
be full of sepulchres and dead men," as if, in sooth, if these
things were not taken away, men would not die! as if dead
bodies could be buried elsewhere than in the ground! as if,
as time advanced, the number of sepulchres must not necessarily
increase in proportion to the increase of the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the dead! But they who are of a perverse mind, and opposed
to us, suppose that what he grieves for is that the memorials
of our martyrs were to succeed to their temples and shrines,
in order, forsooth, that they may have grounds for thinking
that gods were worshipped by the pagans in temples, but that
dead men are worshipped by us in sepulchres. For with such
blindness do impious men, as it were, stumble over mountains,
and will not see the things which strike their own eyes, that
they do not attend to the fact that in all the literature of the
pagans there are not found any, or scarcely any gods, who
have not been men, to whom, when dead, divine honours have
been paid. I will not enlarge on the fact that Varro says
that all dead men are thought by them to be gods Manes, and
proves it by those sacred rites which are performed in honour
of almost all the dead, among which he mentions funeral
games, considering this the very highest proof of divinity,
because games are only wont to be celebrated in honour of
divinities. Hermes himself, of whom we are now treating, in
that same book in which, as if foretelling future things, he
says with sorrow, "Then shall that land, the most holy place
of shrines and temples, be full of sepulchres and dead men,"
testifies that the gods of Egypt were dead men. For, having
said that their forefathers, erring very far with respect to the
knowledge of the gods, incredulous and inattentive to the
divine worship and service, invented the art of making gods,
with which art, when invented, they associated the appropriate
virtue which is inherent in universal nature, and by mixing
up that virtue with this art, they called forth the souls of
demons or of angels (for they could not make souls), and
caused them to take possession of, or associate themselves
with holy images and divine mysteries, in order that through
these souls the images might have power to do good or harm
to men;&mdash;having said this, he goes on, as it were, to prove
it by illustrations, saying, "Thy grandsire, O Æsculapius, the
first discoverer of medicine, to whom a temple was consecrated
in a mountain of Libya, near to the shore of the crocodiles, in
which temple lies his earthly man, that is, his body,&mdash;for the
better part of him, or rather the whole of him, if the whole
man is in the intelligent life, went back to heaven,&mdash;affords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
even now by his divinity all those helps to infirm men, which
formerly he was wont to afford to them by the art of medicine."
He says, therefore, that a dead man was worshipped
as a god in that place where he had his sepulchre. He
deceives men by a falsehood, for the man "went back to
heaven." Then he adds, "Does not Hermes, who was my
grandsire, and whose name I bear, abiding in the country
which is called by his name, help and preserve all mortals
who come to him from every quarter?" For this elder
Hermes, that is, Mercury, who, he says, was his grandsire, is
said to be buried in Hermopolis, that is, in the city called
by his name; so here are two gods whom he affirms to
have been men, Æsculapius and Mercury. Now concerning
Æsculapius, both the Greeks and the Latins think the same
thing; but as to Mercury, there are many who do not think
that he was formerly a mortal, though Hermes testifies that
he was his grandsire. But are these two different individuals
who were called by the same name? I will not dispute much
whether they are different individuals or not. It is sufficient
to know that this Mercury of whom Hermes speaks is, as well
as Æsculapius, a god who once was a man, according to the
testimony of this same Trismegistus, esteemed so great by his
countrymen, and also the grandson of Mercury himself.</p>

<p>Hermes goes on to say, "But do we know how many good
things Isis, the wife of Osiris, bestows when she is propitious,
and what great opposition she can offer when enraged?"
Then, in order to show that there were gods made by men
through this art, he goes on to say, "For it is easy for earthly
and mundane gods to be angry, being made and composed by
men out of either nature;" thus giving us to understand that
he believed that demons were formerly the souls of dead men,
which, as he says, by means of a certain art invented by men
very far in error, incredulous, and irreligious, were caused to
take possession of images, because they who made such gods
were not able to make souls. When, therefore, he says "either
nature," he means soul and body,&mdash;the demon being the soul,
and the image the body. What, then, becomes of that mournful
complaint, that the land of Egypt, the most holy place
of shrines and temples, was to be full of sepulchres and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
dead men? Verily, the fallacious spirit, by whose inspiration
Hermes spoke these things, was compelled to confess through
him that even already that land was full of sepulchres and
of dead men, whom they were worshipping as gods. But it
was the grief of the demons which was expressing itself
through his mouth, who were sorrowing on account of the
punishments which were about to fall upon them at the
tombs of the martyrs. For in many such places they are
tortured and compelled to confess, and are cast out of the
bodies of men, of which they had taken possession.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Concerning the nature of the honour which the Christians pay to
their martyrs.</i></p>

<p>But, nevertheless, we do not build temples, and ordain
priests, rites, and sacrifices for these same martyrs; for they
are not our gods, but their God is our God. Certainly we
honour their reliquaries, as the memorials of holy men of God
who strove for the truth even to the death of their bodies,
that the true religion might be made known, and false and
fictitious religions exposed. For if there were some before
them who thought that these religions were really false and
fictitious, they were afraid to give expression to their convictions.
But who ever heard a priest of the faithful, standing
at an altar built for the honour and worship of God over the
holy body of some martyr, say in the prayers, I offer to thee
a sacrifice, O Peter, or O Paul, or O Cyprian? for it is to
God that sacrifices are offered at their tombs,&mdash;the God who
made them both men and martyrs, and associated them with
holy angels in celestial honour; and the reason why we pay
such honours to their memory is, that by so doing we may
both give thanks to the true God for their victories, and, by
recalling them afresh to remembrance, may stir ourselves up
to imitate them by seeking to obtain like crowns and palms,
calling to our help that same God on whom they called.
Therefore, whatever honours the religious may pay in the
places of the martyrs, they are but honours rendered to their
memory,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> not sacred rites or sacrifices offered to dead men as
to gods. And even such as bring thither food,&mdash;which, indeed,
is not done by the better Christians, and in most places of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the world is not done at all,&mdash;do so in order that it may be
sanctified to them through the merits of the martyrs, in the
name of the Lord of the martyrs, first presenting the food
and offering prayer, and thereafter taking it away to be eaten,
or to be in part bestowed upon the needy.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> But he who
knows the one sacrifice of Christians, which is the sacrifice
offered in those places, also knows that these are not sacrifices
offered to the martyrs. It is, then, neither with divine honours
nor with human crimes, by which they worship their gods,
that we honour our martyrs; neither do we offer sacrifices to
them, or convert the crimes of the gods into their sacred rites.
For let those who will and can read the letter of Alexander
to his mother Olympias, in which he tells the things which
were revealed to him by the priest Leon, and let those who
have read it recall to memory what it contains, that they
may see what great abominations have been handed down to
memory, not by poets, but by the mystic writings of the
Egyptians, concerning the goddess Isis, the wife of Osiris, and
the parents of both, all of whom, according to these writings,
were royal personages. Isis, when sacrificing to her parents,
is said to have discovered a crop of barley, of which she
brought some ears to the king her husband, and his councillor
Mercurius, and hence they identify her with Ceres. Those
who read the letter may there see what was the character of
those people to whom when dead sacred rites were instituted
as to gods, and what those deeds of theirs were which furnished
the occasion for these rites. Let them not once dare to compare
in any respect those people, though they hold them to be
gods, to our holy martyrs, though we do not hold them to be
gods. For we do not ordain priests and offer sacrifices to our
martyrs, as they do to their dead men, for that would be incongruous,
undue, and unlawful, such being due only to God;
and thus we do not delight them with their own crimes, or
with such shameful plays as those in which the crimes of
the gods are celebrated, which are either real crimes committed
by them at a time when they were men, or else, if
they never were men, fictitious crimes invented for the pleasure
of noxious demons. The god of Socrates, if he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
god, cannot have belonged to this class of demons. But
perhaps they who wished to excel in this art of making gods,
imposed a god of this sort on a man who was a stranger to,
and innocent of any connection with that art. What need we
say more? No one who is even moderately wise imagines
that demons are to be worshipped on account of the blessed
life which is to be after death. But perhaps they will say
that all the gods are good, but that of the demons some are
bad and some good, and that it is the good who are to be
worshipped, in order that through them we may attain to the
eternally blessed life. To the examination of this opinion we
will devote the following book.</p>

WITH ETERNAL BLESSEDNESS.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>The point at which the discussion has arrived, and what remains to be
handled.</i></p>

<p>Some have advanced the opinion that there are both good
and bad gods; but some, thinking more respectfully of
the gods have attributed to them so much honour and praise
as to preclude the supposition of any god being wicked. But
those who have maintained that there are wicked gods as well
as good ones have included the demons under the name
"gods," and sometimes, though more rarely, have called the
gods demons; so that they admit that Jupiter, whom they
make the king and head of all the rest, is called a demon by
Homer.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Those, on the other hand, who maintain that the
gods are all good, and far more excellent than the men who
are justly called good, are moved by the actions of the demons,
which they can neither deny nor impute to the gods whose
goodness they affirm, to distinguish between gods and demons;
so that, whenever they find anything offensive in the deeds or
sentiments by which unseen spirits manifest their power, they
believe this to proceed not from the gods, but from the demons.
At the same time they believe that, as no god can hold direct
intercourse with men, these demons hold the position of mediators,
ascending with prayers, and returning with gifts. This
is the opinion of the Platonists, the ablest and most esteemed
of their philosophers, with whom we therefore chose to debate
this question,&mdash;whether the worship of a number of gods is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
any service towards obtaining blessedness in the future life.
And this is the reason why, in the preceding book, we have
inquired how the demons, who take pleasure in such things
as good and wise men loathe and execrate, in the sacrilegious
and immoral fictions which the poets have written, not of men,
but of the gods themselves, and in the wicked and criminal
violence of magical arts, can be regarded as more nearly related
and more friendly to the gods than men are, and can mediate
between good men and the good gods; and it has been demonstrated
that this is absolutely impossible.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Whether among the demons, inferior to the gods, there are any good spirits
under whose guardianship the human soul might reach true blessedness.</i></p>

<p>This book, then, ought, according to the promise made in
the end of the preceding one, to contain a discussion, not of
the difference which exists among the gods, who, according to
the Platonists, are all good, nor of the difference between gods
and demons, the former of whom they separate by a wide
interval from men, while the latter are placed intermediately
between the gods and men, but of the difference, since they
make one, among the demons themselves. This we shall
discuss so far as it bears on our theme. It has been the
common and usual belief that some of the demons are bad,
others good; and this opinion, whether it be that of the
Platonists or any other sect, must by no means be passed over
in silence, lest some one suppose he ought to cultivate the
good demons in order that by their mediation he may be
accepted by the gods, all of whom he believes to be good, and
that he may live with them after death; whereas he would
thus be ensnared in the toils of wicked spirits, and would
wander far from the true God, with whom alone, and in
whom alone, the human soul, that is to say, the soul that is
rational and intellectual, is blessed.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>What Apuleius attributes to the demons, to whom, though he does not deny
them reason, he does not ascribe virtue.</i></p>

<p>What, then, is the difference between good and evil demons?
For the Platonist Apuleius, in a treatise on this whole subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
while he says a great deal about their aerial bodies, has not
a word to say of the spiritual virtues with which, if they
were good, they must have been endowed. Not a word has
he said, then, of that which could give them happiness; but
proof of their misery he has given, acknowledging that their
mind, by which they rank as reasonable beings, is not only
not imbued and fortified with virtue so as to resist all unreasonable
passions, but that it is somehow agitated with
tempestuous emotions, and is thus on a level with the mind
of foolish men. His own words are: "It is this class of
demons the poets refer to, when, without serious error, they
feign that the gods hate and love individuals among men,
prospering and ennobling some, and opposing and distressing
others. Therefore pity, indignation, grief, joy, every human
emotion is experienced by the demons, with the same mental
disturbance, and the same tide of feeling and thought. These
turmoils and tempests banish them far from the tranquillity of
the celestial gods." Can there be any doubt that in these
words it is not some inferior part of their spiritual nature, but
the very mind by which the demons hold their rank as rational
beings, which he says is tossed with passion like a stormy sea?
They cannot, then, be compared even to wise men, who with
undisturbed mind resist these perturbations to which they
are exposed in this life, and from which human infirmity is
never exempt, and who do not yield themselves to approve
of or perpetrate anything which might deflect them from
the path of wisdom and law of rectitude. They resemble in
character, though not in bodily appearance, wicked and foolish
men. I might indeed say they are worse, inasmuch as they
have grown old in iniquity, and incorrigible by punishment.
Their mind, as Apuleius says, is a sea tossed with tempest,
having no rallying point of truth or virtue in their soul from
which they can resist their turbulent and depraved emotions.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap94"></a>4. <i>The opinion of the Peripatetics and Stoics about mental emotions.</i></p>

<p>Among the philosophers there are two opinions about these
mental emotions, which the Greeks call &#960;&#8049;&#952;&#951;, while some of
our own writers, as Cicero, call them perturbations,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
affections, and some, to render the Greek word more accurately,
passions. Some say that even the wise man is subject
to these perturbations, though moderated and controlled by
reason, which imposes laws upon them, and so restrains them
within necessary bounds. This is the opinion of the Platonists
and Aristotelians; for Aristotle was Plato's disciple, and the
founder of the Peripatetic school. But others, as the Stoics,
are of opinion that the wise man is not subject to these perturbations.
But Cicero, in his book <i>De Finibus</i>, shows that
the Stoics are here at variance with the Platonists and Peripatetics
rather in words than in reality; for the Stoics decline
to apply the term "goods" to external and bodily advantages,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
because they reckon that the only good is virtue, the art of
living well, and this exists only in the mind. The other
philosophers, again, use the simple and customary phraseology,
and do not scruple to call these things goods, though in comparison
of virtue, which guides our life, they are little and of
small esteem. And thus it is obvious that, whether these
outward things are called goods or advantages, they are held
in the same estimation by both parties, and that in this
matter the Stoics are pleasing themselves merely with a novel
phraseology. It seems, then, to me that in this question,
whether the wise man is subject to mental passions, or wholly
free from them, the controversy is one of words rather than
of things; for I think that, if the reality and not the mere
sound of the words is considered, the Stoics hold precisely the
same opinion as the Platonists and Peripatetics. For, omitting
for brevity's sake other proofs which I might adduce in support
of this opinion, I will state but one which I consider
conclusive. Aulus Gellius, a man of extensive erudition, and
gifted with an eloquent and graceful style, relates, in his work
entitled <i>Noctes Atticæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> that he once made a voyage with an
eminent Stoic philosopher; and he goes on to relate fully and
with gusto what I shall barely state, that when the ship was
tossed and in danger from a violent storm, the philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
grew pale with terror. This was noticed by those on board,
who, though themselves threatened with death, were curious
to see whether a philosopher would be agitated like other
men. When the tempest had passed over, and as soon as
their security gave them freedom to resume their talk, one
of the passengers, a rich and luxurious Asiatic, begins to
banter the philosopher, and rally him because he had even
become pale with fear, while he himself had been unmoved
by the impending destruction. But the philosopher availed
himself of the reply of Aristippus the Socratic, who, on finding
himself similarly bantered by a man of the same character,
answered, "You had no cause for anxiety for the soul of a
profligate debauchee, but I had reason to be alarmed for the
soul of Aristippus." The rich man being thus disposed of,
Aulus Gellius asked the philosopher, in the interests of science
and not to annoy him, what was the reason of his fear? And
he, willing to instruct a man so zealous in the pursuit of
knowledge, at once took from his wallet a book of Epictetus
the Stoic,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> in which doctrines were advanced which precisely
harmonized with those of Zeno and Chrysippus, the founders
of the Stoical school. Aulus Gellius says that he read in
this book that the Stoics maintain that there are certain
impressions made on the soul by external objects which they
call <i>phantasiæ</i>, and that it is not in the power of the soul to
determine whether or when it shall be invaded by these.
When these impressions are made by alarming and formidable
objects, it must needs be that they move the soul even of the
wise man, so that for a little he trembles with fear, or is
depressed by sadness, these impressions anticipating the work
of reason and self-control; but this does not imply that the
mind accepts these evil impressions, or approves or consents
to them. For this consent is, they think, in a man's power;
there being this difference between the mind of the wise man
and that of the fool, that the fool's mind yields to these passions
and consents to them, while that of the wise man, though it
cannot help being invaded by them, yet retains with unshaken
firmness a true and steady persuasion of those things which
it ought rationally to desire or avoid. This account of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Aulus Gellius relates that he read in the book of Epictetus
about the sentiments and doctrines of the Stoics I have given
as well as I could, not, perhaps, with his choice language, but
with greater brevity, and, I think, with greater clearness.
And if this be true, then there is no difference, or next to
none, between the opinion of the Stoics and that of the other
philosophers regarding mental passions and perturbations, for
both parties agree in maintaining that the mind and reason of
the wise man are not subject to these. And perhaps what
the Stoics mean by asserting this, is that the wisdom which
characterizes the wise man is clouded by no error and sullied
by no taint, but, with this reservation that his wisdom
remains undisturbed, he is exposed to the impressions which
the goods and ills of this life (or, as they prefer to call them,
the advantages or disadvantages) make upon them. For we
need not say that if that philosopher had thought nothing of
those things which he thought he was forthwith to lose, life
and bodily safety, he would not have been so terrified by his
danger as to betray his fear by the pallor of his cheek.
Nevertheless, he might suffer this mental disturbance, and
yet maintain the fixed persuasion that life and bodily safety,
which the violence of the tempest threatened to destroy, are
not those good things which make their possessors good, as
the possession of righteousness does. But in so far as they
persist that we must call them not goods but advantages,
they quarrel about words and neglect things. For what
difference does it make whether goods or advantages be the
better name, while the Stoic no less than the Peripatetic is
alarmed at the prospect of losing them, and while, though they
name them differently, they hold them in like esteem? Both
parties assure us that, if urged to the commission of some
immorality or crime by the threatened loss of these goods or
advantages, they would prefer to lose such things as preserve
bodily comfort and security rather than commit such things
as violate righteousness. And thus the mind in which this
resolution is well grounded suffers no perturbations to prevail
with it in opposition to reason, even though they assail the
weaker parts of the soul; and not only so, but it rules over
them, and, while it refuses its consent and resists them, administers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
a reign of virtue. Such a character is ascribed to
Æneas by Virgil when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He stands immovable by tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor tenderest words with pity hears."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p class="center"><a id="chap95"></a>5. <i>That the passions which assail the souls of Christians do not seduce them
to vice, but exercise their virtue.</i></p>

<p>We need not at present give a careful and copious exposition
of the doctrine of Scripture, the sum of Christian knowledge, regarding
these passions. It subjects the mind itself to God, that
He may rule and aid it, and the passions, again, to the mind,
to moderate and bridle them, and turn them to righteous uses.
In our ethics, we do not so much inquire whether a pious soul
is angry, as why he is angry; not whether he is sad, but what
is the cause of his sadness; not whether he fears, but what he
fears. For I am not aware that any right thinking person
would find fault with anger at a wrongdoer which seeks his
amendment, or with sadness which intends relief to the
suffering, or with fear lest one in danger be destroyed. The
Stoics, indeed, are accustomed to condemn compassion.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But
how much more honourable had it been in that Stoic we have
been telling of, had he been disturbed by compassion prompting
him to relieve a fellow-creature, than to be disturbed by
the fear of shipwreck! Far better, and more humane, and
more consonant with pious sentiments, are the words of Cicero
in praise of Cæsar, when he says, "Among your virtues none
is more admirable and agreeable than your compassion."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
And what is compassion but a fellow-feeling for another's
misery, which prompts us to help him if we can? And this
emotion is obedient to reason, when compassion is shown
without violating right, as when the poor are relieved, or the
penitent forgiven. Cicero, who knew how to use language,
did not hesitate to call this a virtue, which the Stoics are not
ashamed to reckon among the vices, although, as the book
of that eminent Stoic, Epictetus, quoting the opinions of Zeno
and Chrysippus, the founders of the school, has taught us,
they admit that passions of this kind invade the soul of the
wise man, whom they would have to be free from all vice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Whence it follows that these very passions are not judged by
them to be vices, since they assail the wise man without
forcing him to act against reason and virtue; and that, therefore,
the opinion of the Peripatetics or Platonists and of the Stoics
is one and the same. But, as Cicero says,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> mere logomachy
is the bane of these pitiful Greeks, who thirst for contention
rather than for truth. However, it may justly be asked,
whether our subjection to these affections, even while we
follow virtue, is a part of the infirmity of this life? For
the holy angels feel no anger while they punish those whom
the eternal law of God consigns to punishment, no fellow-feeling
with misery while they relieve the miserable, no fear
while they aid those who are in danger; and yet ordinary
language ascribes to them also these mental emotions, because,
though they have none of our weakness, their acts resemble
the actions to which these emotions move us; and thus even
God Himself is said in Scripture to be angry, and yet without
any perturbation. For this word is used of the effect of His
vengeance, not of the disturbing mental affection.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Of the passions which, according to Apuleius, agitate the demons who are
supposed by him to mediate between gods and men.</i></p>

<p>Deferring for the present the question about the holy angels,
let us examine the opinion of the Platonists, that the demons
who mediate between gods and men are agitated by passions.
For if their mind, though exposed to their incursion, still
remained free and superior to them, Apuleius could not have
said that their hearts are tossed with passions as the sea by
stormy winds.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Their mind, then,&mdash;that superior part of their
soul whereby they are rational beings, and which, if it actually
exists in them, should rule and bridle the turbulent passions
of the inferior parts of the soul,&mdash;this mind of theirs, I say, is,
according to the Platonist referred to, tossed with a hurricane
of passions. The mind of the demons, therefore, is subject to
the emotions of fear, anger, lust, and all similar affections.
What part of them, then, is free, and endued with wisdom,
so that they are pleasing to the gods, and the fit guides of
men into purity of life, since their very highest part, being the
slave of passion and subject to vice, only makes them more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
intent on deceiving and seducing, in proportion to the mental
force and energy of desire they possess?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>7. <i>That the Platonists maintain that the poets wrong the gods by representing
them as distracted by party feeling, to which the demons, and not the gods,
are subject.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But if any one says that it is not of all the demons, but
only of the wicked, that the poets, not without truth, say that
they violently love or hate certain men,&mdash;for it was of them
Apuleius said that they were driven about by strong currents
of emotion,&mdash;how can we accept this interpretation, when
Apuleius, in the very same connection, represents all the
demons, and not only the wicked, as intermediate between
gods and men by their aerial bodies? The fiction of the poets,
according to him, consists in their making gods of demons,
and giving them the names of gods, and assigning them as
allies or enemies to individual men, using this poetical licence,
though they profess that the gods are very different in character
from the demons, and far exalted above them by their
celestial abode and wealth of beatitude. This, I say, is the
poets' fiction, to say that these are gods who are not gods, and
that, under the names of gods, they fight among themselves
about the men whom they love or hate with keen partisan
feeling. Apuleius says that this is not far from the truth,
since, though they are wrongfully called by the names of the
gods, they are described in their own proper character as demons.
To this category, he says, belongs the Minerva of Homer,
"who interposed in the ranks of the Greeks to restrain
Achilles."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> For that this was Minerva he supposes to be
poetical fiction; for he thinks that Minerva is a goddess, and
he places her among the gods whom he believes to be all good
and blessed in the sublime ethereal region, remote from intercourse
with men. But that there was a demon favourable
to the Greeks and adverse to the Trojans, as another, whom
the same poet mentions under the name of Venus or Mars
(gods exalted above earthly affairs in their heavenly habitations),
was the Trojans' ally and the foe of the Greeks, and
that these demons fought for those they loved against those
they hated,&mdash;in all this he owned that the poets stated something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
very like the truth. For they made these statements
about beings to whom he ascribes the same violent and tempestuous
passions as disturb men, and who are therefore
capable of loves and hatreds not justly formed, but formed in a
party spirit, as the spectators in races or hunts take fancies
and prejudices. It seems to have been the great fear of this
Platonist that the poetical fictions should be believed of the
gods, and not of the demons who bore their names.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>How Apuleius defines the gods who dwell in heaven, the demons who occupy
the air, and men who inhabit earth.</i></p>

<p>The definition which Apuleius gives of demons, and in
which he of course includes all demons, is that they are in
nature animals, in soul subject to passion, in mind reasonable,
in body aerial, in duration eternal. Now in these five qualities
he has named absolutely nothing which is proper to good men
and not also to bad. For when Apuleius had spoken of the
celestials first, and had then extended his description so as to
include an account of those who dwell far below on the earth,
that, after describing the two extremes of rational being, he
might proceed to speak of the intermediate demons, he says,
"Men, therefore, who are endowed with the faculty of reason
and speech, whose soul is immortal and their members mortal,
who have weak and anxious spirits, dull and corruptible
bodies, dissimilar characters, similar ignorance, who are obstinate
in their audacity, and persistent in their hope, whose
labour is vain, and whose fortune is ever on the wane, their
race immortal, themselves perishing, each generation replenished
with creatures whose life is swift and their wisdom slow, their
death sudden and their life a wail,&mdash;these are the men who
dwell on the earth."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> In recounting so many qualities which
belong to the large proportion of men, did he forget that which
is the property of the few when he speaks of their wisdom
being slow? If this had been omitted, this his description
of the human race, so carefully elaborated, would have been
defective. And when he commended the excellence of the
gods, he affirmed that they excelled in that very blessedness
to which he thinks men must attain by wisdom. And therefore,
if he had wished us to believe that some of the demons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
are good, he should have inserted in his description something
by which we might see that they have, in common with the
gods, some share of blessedness, or, in common with men, some
wisdom. But, as it is, he has mentioned no good quality by
which the good may be distinguished from the bad. For
although he refrained from giving a full account of their
wickedness, through fear of offending, not themselves but their
worshippers, for whom he was writing, yet he sufficiently indicated
to discerning readers what opinion he had of them; for
only in the one article of the eternity of their bodies does he
assimilate them to the gods, all of whom, he asserts, are good
and blessed, and absolutely free from what he himself calls the
stormy passions of the demons; and as to the soul, he quite
plainly affirms that they resemble men and not the gods, and
that this resemblance lies not in the possession of wisdom, which
even men can attain to, but in the perturbation of passions
which sway the foolish and wicked, but is so ruled by the good
and wise that they prefer not to admit rather than to conquer
it. For if he had wished it to be understood that the demons
resembled the gods in the eternity not of their bodies but of
their souls, he would certainly have admitted men to share in
this privilege, because, as a Platonist, he of course must hold
that the human soul is eternal. Accordingly, when describing
this race of living beings, he said that their souls were immortal,
their members mortal. And, consequently, if men
have not eternity in common with the gods because they have
mortal bodies, demons have eternity in common with the gods
because their bodies are immortal.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether the intercession of the demons can secure for men the friendship
of the celestial gods.</i></p>

<p>How, then, can men hope for a favourable introduction to
the friendship of the gods by such mediators as these, who
are, like men, defective in that which is the better part of
every living creature, viz. the soul, and who resemble the gods
only in the body, which is the inferior part? For a living
creature or animal consists of soul and body, and of these two
parts the soul is undoubtedly the better; even though vicious
and weak, it is obviously better than even the soundest and
strongest body, for the greater excellence of its nature is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
reduced to the level of the body even by the pollution of vice,
as gold, even when tarnished, is more precious than the purest
silver or lead. And yet these mediators, by whose interposition
things human and divine are to be harmonized, have an
eternal body in common with the gods, and a vicious soul in
common with men,&mdash;as if the religion by which these demons
are to unite gods and men were a bodily, and not a spiritual
matter. What wickedness, then, or punishment has suspended
these false and deceitful mediators, as it were head downwards,
so that their inferior part, their body, is linked to the gods
above, and their superior part, the soul, bound to men beneath;
united to the celestial gods by the part that serves, and miserable,
together with the inhabitants of earth, by the part that
rules? For the body is the servant, as Sallust says: "We
use the soul to rule, the body to obey;"<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> adding, "the one we
have in common with the gods, the other with the brutes."
For he was here speaking of men; and they have, like the
brutes, a mortal body. These demons, whom our philosophic
friends have provided for us as mediators with the gods, may
indeed say of the soul and body, the one we have in common
with the gods, the other with men; but, as I said, they
are as it were suspended and bound head downwards, having
the slave, the body, in common with the gods, the master,
the soul, in common with miserable men,&mdash;their inferior part
exalted, their superior part depressed. And therefore, if any
one supposes that, because they are not subject, like terrestrial
animals, to the separation of soul and body by death, they
therefore resemble the gods in their eternity, their body must
not be considered a chariot of an eternal triumph, but rather
the chain of an eternal punishment.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>That, according to Plotinus, men, whose body is mortal, are less wretched
than demons, whose body is eternal.</i></p>

<p>Plotinus, whose memory is quite recent,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> enjoys the reputation
of having understood Plato better than any other of his
disciples. In speaking of human souls, he says, "The Father
in compassion made their bonds mortal;"<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> that is to say, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
considered it due to the Father's mercy that men, having a
mortal body, should not be for ever confined in the misery of
this life. But of this mercy the demons have been judged
unworthy, and they have received, in conjunction with a soul
subject to passions, a body not mortal like man's, but eternal.
For they should have been happier than men if they had, like
men, had a mortal body, and, like the gods, a blessed soul.
And they should have been equal to men, if in conjunction
with a miserable soul they had at least received, like men, a
mortal body, so that death might have freed them from
trouble, if, at least, they should have attained some degree
of piety. But, as it is, they are not only no happier than men,
having, like them, a miserable soul, they are also more wretched,
being eternally bound to the body; for he does not leave us
to infer that by some progress in wisdom and piety they can
become gods, but expressly says that they are demons for ever.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the opinion of the Platonists, that the souls of men become demons
when disembodied.</i></p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> says, indeed, that the souls of men are demons, and
that men become <i>Lares</i> if they are good, <i>Lemures</i> or <i>Larvæ</i> if
they are bad, and <i>Manes</i> if it is uncertain whether they deserve
well or ill. Who does not see at a glance that this is
a mere whirlpool sucking men to moral destruction? For,
however wicked men have been, if they suppose they shall
become Larvæ or divine Manes, they will become the worse
the more love they have for inflicting injury; for, as the Larvæ
are hurtful demons made out of wicked men, these men must
suppose that after death they will be invoked with sacrifices
and divine honours that they may inflict injuries. But this
question we must not pursue. He also states that the
blessed are called in Greek &#949;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#8055;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962;, because they are good
souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that
the souls of men are demons.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the three opposite qualities by which the Platonists distinguish between
the nature of men and that of demons.</i></p>

<p>But at present we are speaking of those beings whom he
described as being properly intermediate between gods and
men, in nature animals, in mind rational, in soul subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
passion, in body aerial, in duration eternal. When he had
distinguished the gods, whom he placed in the highest heaven,
from men, whom he placed on earth, not only by position but
also by the unequal dignity of their natures, he concluded in
these words: "You have here two kinds of animals: the
gods, widely distinguished from men by sublimity of abode,
perpetuity of life, perfection of nature; for their habitations
are separated by so wide an interval that there can be no
intimate communication between them, and while the vitality
of the one is eternal and indefeasible, that of the others is
fading and precarious, and while the spirits of the gods are
exalted in bliss, those of men are sunk in miseries."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Here
I find three opposite qualities ascribed to the extremes of
being, the highest and lowest. For, after mentioning the three
qualities for which we are to admire the gods, he repeated,
though in other words, the same three as a foil to the defects of
man. The three qualities are, "sublimity of abode, perpetuity
of life, perfection of nature." These he again mentioned so
as to bring out their contrasts in man's condition. As he had
mentioned "sublimity of abode," he says, "Their habitations
are separated by so wide an interval;" as he had mentioned
"perpetuity of life," he says, that "while divine life is
eternal and indefeasible, human life is fading and precarious;"
and as he had mentioned "perfection of nature," he says, that
"while the spirits of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of
men are sunk in miseries." These three things, then, he predicates
of the gods, exaltation, eternity, blessedness; and of
man he predicates the opposite, lowliness of habitation, mortality,
misery.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>13. <i>How the demons can mediate between gods and men if they have nothing
in common with both, being neither blessed like the gods, nor miserable like
men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If, now, we endeavour to find between these opposites the
mean occupied by the demons, there can be no question as to
their local position; for, between the highest and lowest place,
there is a place which is rightly considered and called the
middle place. The other two qualities remain, and to them
we must give greater care, that we may see whether they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
altogether foreign to the demons, or how they are so bestowed
upon them without infringing upon their mediate position.
We may dismiss the idea that they are foreign to them. For
we cannot say that the demons, being rational animals, are
neither blessed nor wretched, as we say of the beasts and
plants, which are void of feeling and reason, or as we say of
the middle place, that it is neither the highest nor the lowest.
The demons, being rational, must be either miserable or blessed.
And, in like manner, we cannot say that they are neither
mortal nor immortal; for all living things either live eternally
or end life in death. Our author, besides, stated that
the demons are eternal. What remains for us to suppose,
then, but that these mediate beings are assimilated to the gods
in one of the two remaining qualities, and to men in the other?
For if they received both from above, or both from beneath,
they should no longer be mediate, but either rise to the gods
above, or sink to men beneath. Therefore, as it has been
demonstrated that they must possess these two qualities, they
will hold their middle place if they receive one from each
party. Consequently, as they cannot receive their eternity
from beneath, because it is not there to receive, they must get
it from above; and accordingly they have no choice but to
complete their mediate position by accepting misery from men.</p>

<p>According to the Platonists, then, the gods, who occupy the
highest place, enjoy eternal blessedness, or blessed eternity;
men, who occupy the lowest, a mortal misery, or a miserable
mortality; and the demons, who occupy the mean, a miserable
eternity, or an eternal misery. As to those five things which
Apuleius included in his definition of demons, he did not
show, as he promised, that the demons are mediate. For three
of them, that their nature is animal, their mind rational, their
soul subject to passions, he said that they have in common
with men; one thing, their eternity, in common with the gods;
and one proper to themselves, their aerial body. How, then,
are they intermediate, when they have three things in common
with the lowest, and only one in common with the highest?
Who does not see that the intermediate position is abandoned
in proportion as they tend to, and are depressed towards, the
lowest extreme? But perhaps we are to accept them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
intermediate because of their one property of an aerial
body, as the two extremes have each their proper body,
the gods an ethereal, men a terrestrial body, and because
two of the qualities they possess in common with man they
possess also in common with the gods, namely, their animal
nature and rational mind. For Apuleius himself, in speaking
of gods and men, said, "You have two animal natures." And
Platonists are wont to ascribe a rational mind to the gods.
Two qualities remain, their liability to passion, and their
eternity,&mdash;the first of which they have in common with men,
the second with the gods; so that they are neither wafted to
the highest nor depressed to the lowest extreme, but perfectly
poised in their intermediate position. But then, this is the
very circumstance which constitutes the eternal misery, or
miserable eternity, of the demons. For he who says that
their soul is subject to passions would also have said that
they are miserable, had he not blushed for their worshippers.
Moreover, as the world is governed, not by fortuitous haphazard,
but, as the Platonists themselves avow, by the providence
of the supreme God, the misery of the demons would
not be eternal unless their wickedness were great.</p>

<p>If, then, the blessed are rightly styled <i>eudemons</i>, the demons
intermediate between gods and men are not eudemons. What,
then, is the local position of those good demons, who, above
men but beneath the gods, afford assistance to the former,
minister to the latter? For if they are good and eternal,
they are doubtless blessed. But eternal blessedness destroys
their intermediate character, giving them a close resemblance
to the gods, and widely separating them from men. And
therefore the Platonists will in vain strive to show how the
good demons, if they are both immortal and blessed, can justly
be said to hold a middle place between the gods, who are
immortal and blessed, and men, who are mortal and miserable.
For if they have both immortality and blessedness in common
with the gods, and neither of these in common with men, who
are both miserable and mortal, are they not rather remote
from men and united with the gods, than intermediate between
them? They would be intermediate if they held one of their
qualities in common with the one party, and the other with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
the other, as man is a kind of mean between angels and
beasts,&mdash;the beast being an irrational and mortal animal, the
angel a rational and immortal one, while man, inferior to the
angel and superior to the beast, and having in common with
the one mortality, and with the other reason, is a rational and
mortal animal. So, when we seek for an intermediate between
the blessed immortals and miserable mortals, we should find
a being which is either mortal and blessed, or immortal and
miserable.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Whether men, though mortal, can enjoy true blessedness.</i></p>

<p>It is a great question among men, whether man can be
mortal and blessed. Some, taking the humbler view of his
condition, have denied that he is capable of blessedness so
long as he continues in this mortal life; others, again, have
spurned this idea, and have been bold enough to maintain
that, even though mortal, men may be blessed by attaining
wisdom. But if this be the case, why are not these wise men
constituted mediators between miserable mortals and the
blessed immortals, since they have blessedness in common
with the latter, and mortality in common with the former?
Certainly, if they are blessed, they envy no one (for what
more miserable than envy?), but seek with all their might
to help miserable mortals on to blessedness, so that after
death they may become immortal, and be associated with the
blessed and immortal angels.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the man Christ Jesus, the Mediator between God and men</i>.</p>

<p>But if, as is much more probable and credible, it must
needs be that all men, so long as they are mortal, are also
miserable, we must seek an intermediate who is not only man,
but also God, that, by the interposition of His blessed mortality,
He may bring men out of their mortal misery to a
blessed immortality. In this intermediate two things are
requisite, that He become mortal, and that He do not continue
mortal. He did become mortal, not rendering the divinity
of the Word infirm, but assuming the infirmity of flesh.
Neither did He continue mortal in the flesh, but raised it from
the dead; for it is the very fruit of His mediation that those,
for the sake of whose redemption He became the Mediator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
should not abide eternally in bodily death. Wherefore it
became the Mediator between us and God to have both a
transient mortality and a permanent blessedness, that by that
which is transient He might be assimilated to mortals, and
might translate them from mortality to that which is permanent.
Good angels, therefore, cannot mediate between
miserable mortals and blessed immortals, for they themselves
also are both blessed and immortal; but evil angels can mediate,
because they are immortal like the one party, miserable like
the other. To these is opposed the good Mediator, who, in
opposition to their immortality and misery, has chosen to be
mortal for a time, and has been able to continue blessed in
eternity. It is thus He has destroyed, by the humility of
His death and the benignity of His blessedness, those proud
immortals and hurtful wretches, and has prevented them from
seducing to misery by their boast of immortality those men
whose hearts He has cleansed by faith, and whom He has
thus freed from their impure dominion.</p>

<p>Man, then, mortal and miserable, and far removed from the
immortal and the blessed, what medium shall he choose by
which he may be united to immortality and blessedness?
The immortality of the demons, which might have some
charm for man, is miserable; the mortality of Christ, which
might offend man, exists no longer. In the one there is
the fear of an eternal misery; in the other, death, which
could not be eternal, can no longer be feared, and blessedness,
which is eternal, must be loved. For the immortal and
miserable mediator interposes himself to prevent us from
passing to a blessed immortality, because that which hinders
such a passage, namely, misery, continues in him; but the
mortal and blessed Mediator interposed Himself, in order that,
having passed through mortality, He might of mortals make
immortals (showing His power to do this in His own resurrection),
and from being miserable to raise them to the blessed
company from the number of whom He had Himself never departed.
There is, then, a wicked mediator, who separates friends,
and a good Mediator, who reconciles enemies. And those who
separate are numerous, because the multitude of the blessed are
blessed only by their participation in the one God; of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
participation the evil angels being deprived, they are wretched,
and interpose to hinder rather than to help to this blessedness,
and by their very number prevent us from reaching that one
beatific good, to obtain which we need not many but one
Mediator, the uncreated Word of God, by whom all things
were made, and in partaking of whom we are blessed. I do
not say that He is Mediator because He is the Word, for as
the Word He is supremely blessed and supremely immortal,
and therefore far from miserable mortals; but He is Mediator
as He is man, for by His humanity He shows us that, in
order to obtain that blessed and beatific good, we need not
seek other mediators to lead us through the successive steps
of this attainment, but that the blessed and beatific God,
having Himself become a partaker of our humanity, has
afforded us ready access to the participation of His divinity.
For in delivering us from our mortality and misery, He does
not lead us to the immortal and blessed angels, so that we
should become immortal and blessed by participating in their
nature, but He leads us straight to that Trinity, by participating
in which the angels themselves are blessed. Therefore,
when He chose to be in the form of a servant, and lower than

<p>16. <i>Whether it is reasonable in the Platonists to determine that the celestial gods
decline contact with earthly things and intercourse with men, who therefore
require the intercession of the demons.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>That opinion, which the same Platonist avers that Plato
uttered, is not true, "that no god holds intercourse with men."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
And this, he says, is the chief evidence of their exaltation, that
they are never contaminated by contact with men. He admits,
therefore, that the demons are contaminated; and it follows
that they cannot cleanse those by whom they are themselves
contaminated, and thus all alike become impure, the demons
by associating with men, and men by worshipping the demons.
Or, if they say that the demons are not contaminated by
associating and dealing with men, then they are better than the
gods, for the gods, were they to do so, would be contaminated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
For this, we are told, is the glory of the gods, that they are so
highly exalted that no human intercourse can sully them.
He affirms, indeed, that the supreme God, the Creator of all
things, whom we call the true God, is spoken of by Plato as
the only God whom the poverty of human speech fails even
passably to describe; and that even the wise, when their
mental energy is as far as possible delivered from the trammels
of connection with the body, have only such gleams of
insight into His nature as may be compared to a flash of
lightning illumining the darkness. If, then, this supreme
God, who is truly exalted above all things, does nevertheless
visit the minds of the wise, when emancipated from the body,
with an intelligible and ineffable presence, though this be
only occasional, and as it were a swift flash of light athwart
the darkness, why are the other gods so sublimely removed
from all contact with men, as if they would be polluted by it?
as if it were not a sufficient refutation of this to lift up our
eyes to those heavenly bodies which give the earth its needful
light. If the stars, though they, by his account, are visible
gods, are not contaminated when we look at them, neither are
the demons contaminated when men see them quite closely.
But perhaps it is the human voice, and not the eye, which
pollutes the gods; and therefore the demons are appointed to
mediate and carry men's utterances to the gods, who keep
themselves remote through fear of pollution? What am I to
say of the other senses? For by smell neither the demons,
who are present, nor the gods, though they were present and
inhaling the exhalations of living men, would be polluted if they
are not contaminated with the effluvia of the carcases offered
in sacrifice. As for taste, they are pressed by no necessity of
repairing bodily decay, so as to be reduced to ask food from men.
And touch is in their own power. For while it may seem that
contact is so called, because the sense of touch is specially
concerned in it, yet the gods, if so minded, might mingle with
men, so as to see and be seen, hear and be heard; and where
is the need of touching? For men would not dare to desire
this, if they were favoured with the sight or conversation of
gods or good demons; and if through excessive curiosity they
should desire it, how could they accomplish their wish without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the consent of the god or demon, when they cannot touch
so much as a sparrow unless it be caged?</p>

<p>There is, then, nothing to hinder the gods from mingling in
a bodily form with men, from seeing and being seen, from
speaking and hearing. And if the demons do thus mix with
men, as I said, and are not polluted, while the gods, were they
to do so, should be polluted, then the demons are less liable to
pollution than the gods. And if even the demons are contaminated,
how can they help men to attain blessedness after
death, if, so far from being able to cleanse them, and present
them clean to the unpolluted gods, these mediators are themselves
polluted? And if they cannot confer this benefit on
men, what good can their friendly mediation do? Or shall
its result be, not that men find entrance to the gods, but that
men and demons abide together in a state of pollution, and
consequently of exclusion from blessedness? Unless, perhaps,
some one may say that, like sponges or things of that sort, the
demons themselves, in the process of cleansing their friends,
become themselves the filthier in proportion as the others
become clean. But if this is the solution, then the gods, who
shun contact or intercourse with men for fear of pollution, mix
with demons who are far more polluted. Or perhaps the
gods, who cannot cleanse men without polluting themselves,
can without pollution cleanse the demons who have been contaminated
by human contact? Who can believe such follies,
unless the demons have practised their deceit upon him? If
seeing and being seen is contamination, and if the gods, whom
Apuleius himself calls visible, "the brilliant lights of the
world,"<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and the other stars, are seen by men, are we to believe
that the demons, who cannot be seen unless they please, are
safer from contamination? Or if it is only the seeing and not
the being seen which contaminates, then they must deny that
these gods of theirs, these brilliant lights of the world, see
men when their rays beam upon the earth. Their rays are
not contaminated by lighting on all manner of pollution, and
are we to suppose that the gods would be contaminated if
they mixed with men, and even if contact were needed in
order to assist them? For there is contact between the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
and the sun's or moon's rays, and yet this does not pollute
the light.</p>

<p>I am considerably surprised that such learned men, men
who pronounce all material and sensible things to be altogether
inferior to those that are spiritual and intelligible,
should mention bodily contact in connection with the blessed
life. Is that sentiment of Plotinus forgotten?&mdash;"We must fly

he is to Him, there is no other distance from God than unlikeness
to Him. And the soul of man is unlike that incorporeal
and unchangeable and eternal essence, in proportion as
it craves things temporal and mutable. And as the things
beneath, which are mortal and impure, cannot hold intercourse
with the immortal purity which is above, a mediator is indeed
needed to remove this difficulty; but not a mediator who resembles
the highest order of being by possessing an immortal
body, and the lowest by having a diseased soul, which makes
him rather grudge that we be healed than help our cure. We
need a Mediator who, being united to us here below by the mortality
of His body, should at the same time be able to afford us
truly divine help in cleansing and liberating us by means of
the immortal righteousness of His spirit, whereby He remained
heavenly even while here upon earth. Far be it from the
incontaminable God to fear pollution from the man<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> He assumed,
or from the men among whom He lived in the form
of a man. For, though His incarnation showed us nothing
else, these two wholesome facts were enough, that true
divinity cannot be polluted by flesh, and that demons are not
to be considered better than ourselves because they have not
flesh.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> This, then, as Scripture says, is the "Mediator between
God and man, the man Christ Jesus,"<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> of whose divinity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
whereby He is equal to the Father, and humanity, whereby
He has become like us, this is not the place to speak as fully
as I could.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>That the deceitful demons, while promising to conduct men to God by their
intercession, mean to turn them from the path of truth.</i></p>

<p>As to the demons, these false and deceitful mediators, who,
though their uncleanness of spirit frequently reveals their
misery and malignity, yet, by virtue of the levity of their aerial
bodies and the nature of the places they inhabit, do contrive
to turn us aside and hinder our spiritual progress; they do
not help us towards God, but rather prevent us from reaching
Him. Since even in the bodily way, which is erroneous and
misleading, and in which righteousness does not walk,&mdash;for we
must rise to God not by bodily ascent, but by incorporeal or
spiritual conformity to Him,&mdash;in this bodily way, I say, which
the friends of the demons arrange according to the weight of
the various elements, the aerial demons being set between the
ethereal gods and earthy men, they imagine the gods to have
this privilege, that by this local interval they are preserved
from the pollution of human contact. Thus they believe that
the demons are contaminated by men rather than men cleansed
by the demons, and that the gods themselves should be polluted
unless their local superiority preserved them. Who is
so wretched a creature as to expect purification by a way in
which men are contaminating, demons contaminated, and gods
contaminable? Who would not rather choose that way whereby
we escape the contamination of the demons, and are cleansed
from pollution by the incontaminable God, so as to be associated
with the uncontaminated angels?</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>That even among their own worshippers the name "demon" has never a
good signification.</i></p>

<p>But as some of these demonolators, as I may call them,
and among them Labeo, allege that those whom they call
demons are by others called angels, I must, if I would not
seem to dispute merely about words, say something about the
good angels. The Platonists do not deny their existence, but
prefer to call them good demons. But we, following Scripture,
according to which we are Christians, have learned that some
of the angels are good, some bad, but never have we read in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Scripture of good demons; but wherever this or any cognate
term occurs, it is applied only to wicked spirits. And this
usage has become so universal, that, even among those who
are called pagans, and who maintain that demons as well as
gods should be worshipped, there is scarcely a man, no matter
how well read and learned, who would dare to say by way of
praise to his slave, You have a demon, or who could doubt
that the man to whom he said this would consider it a curse?
Why, then, are we to subject ourselves to the necessity of
explaining away what we have said when we have given
offence by using the word demon, with which every one, or
almost every one, connects a bad meaning, while we can so
easily evade this necessity by using the word angel?</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the kind of knowledge which puffs up the demons.</i></p>

<p>However, the very origin of the name suggests something
worthy of consideration, if we compare it with the divine
books. They are called demons from a Greek word meaning
knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Now the apostle, speaking with the Holy Spirit,
says, "Knowledge puffeth up, but charity buildeth up."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
And this can only be understood as meaning that without
charity knowledge does no good, but inflates a man or magnifies
him with an empty windiness. The demons, then, have
knowledge without charity, and are thereby so inflated or
proud, that they crave those divine honours and religious services
which they know to be due to the true God, and still,
as far as they can, exact these from all over whom they have
influence. Against this pride of the demons, under which the
human race was held subject as its merited punishment, there
was exerted the mighty influence of the humility of God, who
appeared in the form of a servant; but men, resembling the
demons in pride, but not in knowledge, and being puffed up
with uncleanness, failed to recognise Him.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>To what extent the Lord was pleased to make Himself known to the demons.</i></p>

<p>The devils themselves knew this manifestation of God so
well, that they said to the Lord, though clothed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
infirmity of flesh, "What have we to do with Thee, Jesus of
Nazareth? Art Thou come to destroy us before the time?"<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
From these words, it is clear that they had great knowledge,
and no charity. They feared His power to punish, and did not
love His righteousness. He made known to them so much
as He pleased, and He was pleased to make known so much
as was needful. But He made Himself known, not as to the
holy angels, who know Him as the Word of God, and rejoice
in His eternity, which they partake, but as was requisite to
strike with terror the beings from whose tyranny He was going
to free those who were predestined to His kingdom and the
glory of it, eternally true and truly eternal. He made Himself
known, therefore, to the demons, not by that which is life
eternal, and the unchangeable light which illumines the pious,
whose souls are cleansed by the faith that is in Him, but by
some temporal effects of His power, and evidences of His
mysterious presence, which were more easily discerned by the
angelic senses even of wicked spirits than by human infirmity.
But when He judged it advisable gradually to suppress these
signs, and to retire into deeper obscurity, the prince of the
demons doubted whether He were the Christ, and endeavoured
to ascertain this by tempting Him, in so far as He permitted
Himself to be tempted, that He might adapt the manhood He
wore to be an example for our imitation. But after that
temptation, when, as Scripture says, He was ministered to<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> by
the angels who are good and holy, and therefore objects of
terror to the impure spirits, He revealed more and more distinctly
to the demons how great He was, so that, even though
the infirmity of His flesh might seem contemptible, none dared
to resist His authority.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>The difference between the knowledge of the holy angels and that
of the demons.</i></p>

<p>The good angels, therefore, hold cheap all that knowledge
of material and transitory things which the demons are so
proud of possessing,&mdash;not that they are ignorant of these things,
but because the love of God, whereby they are sanctified, is
very dear to them, and because, in comparison of that not
merely immaterial but also unchangeable and ineffable beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
with the holy love of which they are inflamed, they despise
all things which are beneath it, and all that is not it, that they
may with every good thing that is in them enjoy that good
which is the source of their goodness. And therefore they
have a more certain knowledge even of those temporal and
mutable things, because they contemplate their principles and
causes in the word of God, by which the world was made,&mdash;those
causes by which one thing is approved, another rejected,
and all arranged. But the demons do not behold in the wisdom
of God these eternal, and, as it were, cardinal causes of things
temporal, but only foresee a larger part of the future than
men do, by reason of their greater acquaintance with the signs
which are hidden from us. Sometimes, too, it is their own intentions
they predict. And, finally, the demons are frequently,
the angels never, deceived. For it is one thing, by the aid
of things temporal and changeable, to conjecture the changes
that may occur in time, and to modify such things by one's
own will and faculty,&mdash;and this is to a certain extent permitted
to the demons,&mdash;it is another thing to foresee the
changes of times in the eternal and immutable laws of God,
which live in His wisdom, and to know the will of God, the
most infallible and powerful of all causes, by participating in
His spirit; and this is granted to the holy angels by a just
discretion. And thus they are not only eternal, but blessed
And the good wherein they are blessed is God, by whom they
were created. For without end they enjoy the contemplation
and participation of Him.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>That the name of gods is falsely given to the gods of the Gentiles, though
Scripture applies it both to the holy angels and just men.</i></p>

<p>If the Platonists prefer to call these angels gods rather than
demons, and to reckon them with those whom Plato, their
founder and master, maintains were created by the supreme
God,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> they are welcome to do so, for I will not spend strength
in fighting about words. For if they say that these beings
are immortal, and yet created by the supreme God, blessed
but by cleaving to their Creator and not by their own power,
they say what we say, whatever name they call these beings
by. And that this is the opinion either of all or the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
the Platonists can be ascertained by their writings. And regarding
the name itself, if they see fit to call such blessed and
immortal creatures gods, this need not give rise to any serious
discussion between us, since in our own Scriptures we read,
"The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken;"<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and again, "Confess
to the God of gods;"<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and again, "He is a great King
above all gods."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> And where it is said, "He is to be feared
above all gods," the reason is forthwith added, for it follows,
"for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made
the heavens."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He said, "above all gods," but added, "of the
nations;" that is to say, above all those whom the nations
count gods, in other words, demons. By them He is to be
feared with that terror in which they cried to the Lord, "Hast
Thou come to destroy us?" But where it is said, "the God of
gods," it cannot be understood as the god of the demons; and
far be it from us to say that "great King above all gods"
means "great King above all demons." But the same Scripture
also calls men who belong to God's people "gods:" "I have said,
Ye are gods, and all of you children of the Most High."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Accordingly,
when God is styled God of gods, this may be understood
of these gods; and so, too, when He is styled a great
King above all gods.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some one may say, if men are called gods
because they belong to God's people, whom He addresses by
means of men and angels, are not the immortals, who already
enjoy that felicity which men seek to attain by worshipping
God, much more worthy of the title? And what shall we
reply to this, if not that it is not without reason that in holy
Scripture men are more expressly styled gods than those immortal
and blessed spirits to whom we hope to be equal in
the resurrection, because there was a fear that the weakness
of unbelief, being overcome with the excellence of these beings,
might presume to constitute some of them a god? In the
case of men this was a result that need not be guarded against.
Besides, it was right that the men belonging to God's people
should be more expressly called gods, to assure and certify
them that He who is called God of gods is their God; because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
although those immortal and blessed spirits who dwell
in the heavens are called gods, yet they are not called gods of
gods, that is to say, gods of the men who constitute God's
people, and to whom it is said, "I have said, Ye are gods, and
all of you the children of the Most High." Hence the saying
of the apostle, "Though there be that are called gods, whether
in heaven or in earth, as there be gods many and lords many,
but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
are all things, and we by Him."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>We need not, therefore, laboriously contend about the name,
since the reality is so obvious as to admit of no shadow of
doubt. That which we say, that the angels who are sent to
announce the will of God to men belong to the order of blessed
immortals, does not satisfy the Platonists, because they believe
that this ministry is discharged, not by those whom they call
gods, in other words, not by blessed immortals, but by demons,
whom they dare not affirm to be blessed, but only immortal,
or if they do rank them among the blessed immortals, yet only
as good demons, and not as gods who dwell in the heaven of
heavens remote from all human contact. But, though it may
seem mere wrangling about a name, yet the name of demon
is so detestable that we cannot bear in any sense to apply it
to the holy angels. Now, therefore, let us close this book in
the assurance that, whatever we call these immortal and
blessed spirits, who yet are only creatures, they do not act as
mediators to introduce to everlasting felicity miserable mortals,
from whom they are severed by a twofold distinction. And
those others who are mediators, in so far as they have immortality
in common with their superiors, and misery in
common with their inferiors (for they are justly miserable in
punishment of their wickedness), cannot bestow upon us, but
rather grudge that we should possess, the blessedness from
which they themselves are excluded. And so the friends of
the demons have nothing considerable to allege why we should
rather worship them as our helpers than avoid them as traitors
to our interests. As for those spirits who are good, and who
are therefore not only immortal but also blessed, and to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
they suppose we should give the title of gods, and offer worship
and sacrifices for the sake of inheriting a future life, we
shall, by God's help, endeavour in the following book to show
that these spirits, call them by what name, and ascribe to them
what nature you will, desire that religious worship be paid to
God alone, by whom they were created, and by whose communications
of Himself to them they are blessed.</p>

<p>1. <i>That the Platonists themselves have determined that God alone can confer

whether those spirits whom they direct us to worship, that we may obtain
happiness, wish sacrifice to be offered to themselves, or to the one God
only.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It is the decided opinion of all who use their brains, that
all men desire to be happy. But who are happy, or
how they become so, these are questions about which the
weakness of human understanding stirs endless and angry
controversies, in which philosophers have wasted their strength
and expended their leisure. To adduce and discuss their
various opinions would be tedious, and is unnecessary. The
reader may remember what we said in the eighth book, while
making a selection of the philosophers with whom we might
discuss the question regarding the future life of happiness,
whether we can reach it by paying divine honours to the one
true God, the Creator of all gods, or by worshipping many
gods, and he will not expect us to repeat here the same
argument, especially as, even if he has forgotten it, he may
refresh his memory by reperusal. For we made selection of
the Platonists, justly esteemed the noblest of the philosophers,
because they had the wit to perceive that the human soul,
immortal and rational, or intellectual, as it is, cannot be happy
except by partaking of the light of that God by whom both
itself and the world were made; and also that the happy life
which all men desire cannot be reached by any who does not
cleave with a pure and holy love to that one supreme good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the unchangeable God. But as even these philosophers,
whether accommodating to the folly and ignorance of the
people, or, as the apostle says, "becoming vain in their imaginations,"<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
supposed or allowed others to suppose that many
gods should be worshipped, so that some of them considered
that divine honour by worship and sacrifice should be rendered
even to the demons (an error I have already exploded),
we must now, by God's help, ascertain what is thought about
our religious worship and piety by those immortal and blessed
spirits, who dwell in the heavenly places among dominations,
principalities, powers, whom the Platonists call gods, and
some either good demons, or, like us, angels,&mdash;that is to say,
to put it more plainly, whether the angels desire us to offer
sacrifice and worship, and to consecrate our possessions and
ourselves, to them, or only to God, theirs and ours.</p>

<p>For this is the worship which is due to the Divinity, or,
to speak more accurately, to the Deity; and, to express this
worship in a single word, as there does not occur to me any
Latin term sufficiently exact, I shall avail myself, whenever
necessary, of a Greek word. &#923;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, whenever it occurs in
Scripture, is rendered by the word service. But that service
which is due to men, and in reference to which the apostle
writes that servants must be subject to their own masters,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> is
usually designated by another word in Greek,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> whereas the
service which is paid to God alone by worship, is always, or
almost always, called &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945; in the usage of those who wrote
from the divine oracles. This cannot so well be called simply
"cultus," for in that case it would not seem to be due exclusively
to God; for the same word is applied to the respect
we pay either to the memory or the living presence of men.
From it, too, we derive the words agriculture, colonist, and
others.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> And the heathen call their gods "c&#339;licolæ," not because
they worship heaven, but because they dwell in it, and
as it were colonize it,&mdash;not in the sense in which we call those
colonists who are attached to their native soil to cultivate it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
under the rule of the owners, but in the sense in which the
great master of the Latin language says, "There was an ancient
city inhabited by Tyrian colonists."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> He called them colonists,
not because they cultivated the soil, but because they inhabited
the city. So, too, cities that have hived off from
larger cities are called colonies. Consequently, while it is
quite true that, using the word in a special sense, "cult" can
be rendered to none but God, yet, as the word is applied to
other things besides, the cult due to God cannot in Latin be
expressed by this word alone.</p>

<p>The word "religion" might seem to express more definitely
the worship due to God alone, and therefore Latin translators
have used this word to represent &#952;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#945;; yet, as not
only the uneducated, but also the best instructed, use the word
religion to express human ties, and relationships, and affinities,
it would inevitably introduce ambiguity to use this word in
discussing the worship of God, unable as we are to say that
religion is nothing else than the worship of God, without contradicting
the common usage which applies this word to the
observance of social relationships. "Piety," again, or, as the
Greeks say, &#949;&#8016;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;, is commonly understood as the proper
designation of the worship of God. Yet this word also is used
of dutifulness to parents. The common people, too, use it of
works of charity, which, I suppose, arises from the circumstance
that God enjoins the performance of such works, and
declares that He is pleased with them instead of, or in preference
to sacrifices. From this usage it has also come to pass
that God Himself is called pious,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> in which sense the Greeks
never use &#949;&#8016;&#963;&#949;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, though &#949;&#8016;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945; is applied to works of
charity by their common people also. In some passages of
Scripture, therefore, they have sought to preserve the distinction
by using not &#949;&#8016;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;, the more general word, but
&#952;&#949;&#959;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;, which literally denotes the worship of God. We,
on the other hand, cannot express either of these ideas by one
word. This worship, then, which in Greek is called &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;,
and in Latin "servitus" [service], but the service due to God
only; this worship, which in Greek is called &#952;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Latin "religio," but the religion by which we are bound to God
only; this worship, which they call &#952;&#949;&#959;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;, but which we
cannot express in one word, but call it the worship of God,&mdash;this,
we say, belongs only to that God who is the true God, and
who makes His worshippers gods.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> And therefore, whoever
these immortal and blessed inhabitants of heaven be, if they do
not love us, and wish us to be blessed, then we ought not to
worship them; and if they do love us and desire our happiness,
they cannot wish us to be made happy by any other
means than they themselves have enjoyed,&mdash;for how could
they wish our blessedness to flow from one source, theirs from
another?</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>The opinion of Plotinus the Platonist regarding enlightenment from above.</i></p>

<p>But with these more estimable philosophers we have no
dispute in this matter. For they perceived, and in various
forms abundantly expressed in their writings, that these spirits
have the same source of happiness as ourselves,&mdash;a certain
intelligible light, which is their God, and is different from
themselves, and illumines them that they may be penetrated
with light, and enjoy perfect happiness in the participation of
God. Plotinus, commenting on Plato, repeatedly and strongly
asserts that not even the soul which they believe to be the
soul of the world, derives its blessedness from any other
source than we do, viz. from that Light which is distinct from
it and created it, and by whose intelligible illumination it
enjoys light in things intelligible. He also compares those
spiritual things to the vast and conspicuous heavenly bodies,
as if God were the sun, and the soul the moon; for they
suppose that the moon derives its light from the sun. That
great Platonist, therefore, says that the rational soul, or rather
the intellectual soul,&mdash;in which class he comprehends the
souls of the blessed immortals who inhabit heaven,&mdash;has no
nature superior to it save God, the Creator of the world and
the soul itself, and that these heavenly spirits derive their
blessed life, and the light of truth, from the same source as
ourselves, agreeing with the gospel where we read, "There was
a man sent from God whose name was John; the same came
for a witness to bear witness of that Light, that through Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
all might believe. He was not that Light, but that he might
bear witness of the Light. That was the true Light which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world;"<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>&mdash;a distinction
which sufficiently proves that the rational or intellectual
soul such as John had cannot be its own light, but
needs to receive illumination from another, the true Light.
This John himself avows when he delivers his witness: "We
have all received of His fulness."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>3. <i>That the Platonists, though knowing something of the Creator of the universe,
have misunderstood the true worship of God, by giving divine honour to
angels, good or bad.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This being so, if the Platonists, or those who think with
them, knowing God, glorified Him as God and gave thanks, if
they did not become vain in their own thoughts, if they did
not originate or yield to the popular errors, they would certainly
acknowledge that neither could the blessed immortals
retain, nor we miserable mortals reach, a happy condition
without worshipping the one God of gods, who is both theirs
and ours. To Him we owe the service which is called in
Greek &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, whether we render it outwardly or inwardly;
for we are all His temple, each of us severally and all of us
together, because He condescends to inhabit each individually
and the whole harmonious body, being no greater in all than
in each, since He is neither expanded nor divided. Our heart
when it rises to Him is His altar; the priest who intercedes
for us is His Only-begotten; we sacrifice to Him bleeding
victims when we contend for His truth even unto blood; to
Him we offer the sweetest incense when we come before Him
burning with holy and pious love; to Him we devote and
surrender ourselves and His gifts in us; to Him, by solemn
feasts and on appointed days, we consecrate the memory of
His benefits, lest through the lapse of time ungrateful oblivion
should steal upon us; to Him we offer on the altar of our
heart the sacrifice of humility and praise, kindled by the fire
of burning love. It is that we may see Him, so far as He
can be seen; it is that we may cleave to Him, that we are
cleansed from all stain of sins and evil passions, and are consecrated
in His name. For He is the fountain of our happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
He the end of all our desires. Being attached to Him, or
rather let me say, re-attached,&mdash;for we had detached ourselves
and lost hold of Him,&mdash;being, I say, re-attached to Him,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> we
tend towards Him by love, that we may rest in Him, and find
our blessedness by attaining that end. For our good, about
which philosophers have so keenly contended, is nothing else
than to be united to God. It is, if I may say so, by spiritually
embracing Him that the intellectual soul is filled and impregnated
with true virtues. We are enjoined to love this good
with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our strength.
To this good we ought to be led by those who love us, and
to lead those we love. Thus are fulfilled those two commandments
on which hang all the law and the prophets: "Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy mind, and with all thy soul;" and "Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> For, that man might be intelligent in
his self-love, there was appointed for him an end to which
he might refer all his actions, that he might be blessed. For
he who loves himself wishes nothing else than this. And the
end set before him is "to draw near to God."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> And so, when
one who has this intelligent self-love is commanded to love
his neighbour as himself, what else is enjoined than that he
shall do all in his power to commend to him the love of God?
This is the worship of God, this is true religion, this right
piety, this the service due to God only. If any immortal
power, then, no matter with what virtue endowed, loves us as
himself, he must desire that we find our happiness by submitting
ourselves to Him, in submission to whom he himself finds
happiness. If he does not worship God, he is wretched, because
deprived of God; if he worships God, he cannot wish
to be worshipped in God's stead. On the contrary, these
higher powers acquiesce heartily in the divine sentence in
which it is written, "He that sacrificeth unto any god, save
unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>


<p class="center">4. <i>That sacrifice is due to the true God only.</i></p>

<p>But, putting aside for the present the other religious services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
with which God is worshipped, certainly no man would dare
to say that sacrifice is due to any but God. Many parts,
indeed, of divine worship are unduly used in showing honour
to men, whether through an excessive humility or pernicious
flattery; yet, while this is done, those persons who are thus
worshipped and venerated, or even adored, are reckoned no
more than human; and who ever thought of sacrificing save
to one whom he knew, supposed, or feigned to be a god?
And how ancient a part of God's worship sacrifice is, those
two brothers, Cain and Abel, sufficiently show, of whom God
rejected the elder's sacrifice, and looked favourably on the
younger's.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the sacrifices which God does not require, but wished to be observed for the
exhibition of those things which He does require.</i></p>

<p>And who is so foolish as to suppose that the things offered
to God are needed by Him for some uses of His own? Divine
Scripture in many places explodes this idea. Not to be wearisome,
suffice it to quote this brief saying from a psalm: "I
have said to the Lord, Thou art my God: for Thou needest
not my goodness."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> We must believe, then, that God has no
need, not only of cattle, or any other earthly and material
thing, but even of man's righteousness, and that whatever
right worship is paid to God profits not Him, but man. For
no man would say he did a benefit to a fountain by drinking,
or to the light by seeing. And the fact that the ancient
church offered animal sacrifices, which the people of God
now-a-days reads of without imitating, proves nothing else
than this, that those sacrifices signified the things which we
do for the purpose of drawing near to God, and inducing our
neighbour to do the same. A sacrifice, therefore, is the visible
sacrament or sacred sign of an invisible sacrifice. Hence that
penitent in the psalm, or it may be the Psalmist himself,
entreating God to be merciful to his sins, says, "If Thou
desiredst sacrifice, I would give it: Thou delightest not in
whole burnt-offerings. The sacrifice of God is a broken heart:
a heart contrite and humble God will not despise."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Observe
how, in the very words in which he is expressing God's refusal
of sacrifice, he shows that God requires sacrifice. He does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
not desire the sacrifice of a slaughtered beast, but He desires
the sacrifice of a contrite heart. Thus, that sacrifice which he
says God does not wish, is the symbol of the sacrifice which
God does wish. God does not wish sacrifices in the sense
in which foolish people think He wishes them, viz. to gratify
His own pleasure. For if He had not wished that the sacrifices
He requires, as, <i>e.g.</i>, a heart contrite and humbled by
penitent sorrow, should be symbolized by those sacrifices
which He was thought to desire because pleasant to Himself,
the old law would never have enjoined their presentation;
and they were destined to be merged when the fit opportunity
arrived, in order that men might not suppose that the sacrifices
themselves, rather than the things symbolized by them,
were pleasing to God or acceptable in us. Hence, in another
passage from another psalm, he says, "If I were hungry, I
would not tell thee; for the world is mine and the fulness
thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of
goats?"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> as if He should say, Supposing such things were
necessary to me, I would never ask thee for what I have in
my own hand. Then he goes on to mention what these
signify: "Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy
vows unto the Most High. And call upon me in the day of
trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> So
in another prophet: "Wherewith shall I come before the
Lord, and bow myself before the High God? Shall I come
before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old?
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my
transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Hath He showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?"<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> In the words of this
prophet, these two things are distinguished and set forth with
sufficient explicitness, that God does not require these sacrifices
for their own sakes, and that He does require the sacrifices
which they symbolize. In the epistle entitled "To the
Hebrews" it is said, "To do good and to communicate, forget
not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> And so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
when it is written, "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice,"<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
nothing else is meant than that one sacrifice is preferred to
another; for that which in common speech is called sacrifice
is only the symbol of the true sacrifice. Now mercy is the
true sacrifice, and therefore it is said, as I have just quoted,
"with such sacrifices God is well pleased." All the divine
ordinances, therefore, which we read concerning the sacrifices
in the service of the tabernacle or the temple, we are to refer
to the love of God and our neighbour. For "on these two
commandments," as it is written, "hang all the law and the
prophets."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap106"></a>6. <i>Of the true and perfect sacrifice.</i></p>

<p>Thus a true sacrifice is every work which is done that we
may be united to God in holy fellowship, and which has a
reference to that supreme good and end in which alone we
can be truly blessed.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> And therefore even the mercy we
show to men, if it is not shown for God's sake, is not a
sacrifice. For, though made or offered by man, sacrifice is
a divine thing, as those who called it <i>sacrifice</i><a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> meant to
indicate. Thus man himself, consecrated in the name of God,
and vowed to God, is a sacrifice in so far as he dies to the
world that he may live to God. For this is a part of that
mercy which each man shows to himself; as it is written,
"Have mercy on thy soul by pleasing God."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Our body, too,
is a sacrifice when we chasten it by temperance, if we do so
as we ought, for God's sake, that we may not yield our members
instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but instruments
of righteousness unto God.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Exhorting to this sacrifice, the
apostle says, "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercy
of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> If,
then, the body, which, being inferior, the soul uses as a servant
or instrument, is a sacrifice when it is used rightly, and with
reference to God, how much more does the soul itself become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
a sacrifice when it offers itself to God, in order that, being
inflamed by the fire of His love, it may receive of His beauty
and become pleasing to Him, losing the shape of earthly
desire, and being remoulded in the image of permanent loveliness?
And this, indeed, the apostle subjoins, saying, "And be
not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed in the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
and acceptable, and perfect will of God."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Since, therefore,
true sacrifices are works of mercy to ourselves or others, done
with a reference to God, and since works of mercy have no
other object than the relief of distress or the conferring of
happiness, and since there is no happiness apart from that
good of which it is said, "It is good for me to be very near to
God,"<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> it follows that the whole redeemed city, that is to say,
the congregation or community of the saints, is offered to God
as our sacrifice through the great High Priest, who offered
Himself to God in His passion for us, that we might be
members of this glorious head, according to the form of a
servant. For it was this form He offered, in this He was
offered, because it is according to it He is Mediator, in this
He is our Priest, in this the Sacrifice. Accordingly, when
the apostle had exhorted us to present our bodies a living
sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, our reasonable service, and
not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed in the
renewing of our mind, that we might prove what is that good,
and acceptable, and perfect will of God, that is to say, the true
sacrifice of ourselves, he says, "For I say, through the grace
of God which is given unto me, to every man that is among
you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
every man the measure of faith. For, as we have many
members in one body, and all members have not the same
office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every
one members one of another, having gifts differing according
to the grace that is given to us."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> This is the sacrifice of
Christians: we, being many, are one body in Christ. And this
also is the sacrifice which the Church continually celebrates in
the sacrament of the altar, known to the faithful, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
she teaches that she herself is offered in the offering she
makes to God.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the love of the holy angels, which prompts them to desire that we worship
the one true God, and not themselves.</i></p>

<p>It is very right that these blessed and immortal spirits,
who inhabit celestial dwellings, and rejoice in the communications
of their Creator's fulness, firm in His eternity, assured
in His truth, holy by His grace, since they compassionately
and tenderly regard us miserable mortals, and wish us to
become immortal and happy, do not desire us to sacrifice to
themselves, but to Him whose sacrifice they know themselves
to be in common with us. For we and they together are the
one city of God, to which it is said in the psalm, "Glorious
things are spoken of thee, O city of God;"<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> the human part
sojourning here below, the angelic aiding from above. For
from that heavenly city, in which God's will is the intelligible
and unchangeable law, from that heavenly council-chamber,&mdash;for
they sit in counsel regarding us,&mdash;that holy Scripture, descended
to us by the ministry of angels, in which it is written,
"He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only,
he shall be utterly destroyed,"<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>&mdash;this Scripture, this law, these
precepts, have been confirmed by such miracles, that it is sufficiently
evident to whom these immortal and blessed spirits,
who desire us to be like themselves, wish us to sacrifice.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of the miracles which God has condescended to adhibit, through the ministry
of angels, to His promises for the confirmation of the faith of the godly.</i></p>

<p>I should seem tedious were I to recount all the ancient
miracles, which were wrought in attestation of God's promises
which He made to Abraham thousands of years ago,
that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
For who can but marvel that Abraham's barren wife should
have given birth to a son at an age when not even a prolific
woman could bear children; or, again, that when Abraham
sacrificed, a flame from heaven should have run between the
divided parts;<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> or that the angels in human form, whom he

of Sodom by fire from heaven;<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and that his nephew Lot
should have been rescued from Sodom by the angels as the
fire was just descending, while his wife, who looked back as
she went, and was immediately turned into salt, stood as a
sacred beacon warning us that no one who is being saved
should long for what he is leaving? How striking also were
the wonders done by Moses to rescue God's people from the
yoke of slavery in Egypt, when the magi of the Pharaoh, that
is, the king of Egypt, who tyrannized over this people, were
suffered to do some wonderful things that they might be
vanquished all the more signally! They did these things by
the magical arts and incantations to which the evil spirits or
demons are addicted; while Moses, having as much greater
power as he had right on his side, and having the aid of
angels, easily conquered them in the name of the Lord who
made heaven and earth. And, in fact, the magicians failed
at the third plague; whereas Moses, dealing out the miracles
delegated to him, brought ten plagues upon the land, so that
the hard hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians yielded, and
the people were let go. But, quickly repenting, and essaying
to overtake the departing Hebrews, who had crossed the
sea on dry ground, they were covered and overwhelmed in
the returning waters. What shall I say of those frequent
and stupendous exhibitions of divine power, while the people
were conducted through the wilderness?&mdash;of the waters which
could not be drunk, but lost their bitterness, and quenched
the thirsty, when at God's command a piece of wood was cast
into them? of the manna that descended from heaven to
appease their hunger, and which begat worms and putrefied
when any one collected more than the appointed quantity,
and yet, though double was gathered on the day before the
Sabbath (it not being lawful to gather it on that day), remained
fresh? of the birds which filled the camp, and turned
appetite into satiety when they longed for flesh, which it
seemed impossible to supply to so vast a population? of the
enemies who met them, and opposed their passage with arms,
and were defeated without the loss of a single Hebrew, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Moses prayed with his hands extended in the form of a cross?
of the seditious persons who arose among God's people, and
separated themselves from the divinely-ordered community,
and were swallowed up alive by the earth, a visible token of
an invisible punishment? of the rock struck with the rod,
and pouring out waters more than enough for all the host? of
the deadly serpents' bites, sent in just punishment of sin, but
healed by looking at the lifted brazen serpent, so that not only
were the tormented people healed, but a symbol of the crucifixion
of death set before them in this destruction of death by
death? It was this serpent which was preserved in memory
of this event, and was afterwards worshipped by the mistaken
people as an idol, and was destroyed by the pious and God-fearing
king Hezekiah, much to his credit.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap9"></a>9. <i>Of the illicit arts connected with demonolatry, and of which the Platonist
Porphyry adopts some, and discards others.</i></p>

<p>These miracles, and many others of the same nature, which
it were tedious to mention, were wrought for the purpose of
commending the worship of the one true God, and prohibiting
the worship of a multitude of false gods. Moreover, they were
wrought by simple faith and godly confidence, not by the incantations
and charms composed under the influence of a
criminal tampering with the unseen world, of an art which
they call either magic, or by the more abominable title necromancy,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
or the more honourable designation theurgy; for they
wish to discriminate between those whom the people call
magicians, who practise necromancy, and are addicted to illicit
arts and condemned, and those others who seem to them to
be worthy of praise for their practice of theurgy,&mdash;the truth,
however, being that both classes are the slaves of the deceitful
rites of the demons whom they invoke under the names
of angels.</p>

<p>For even Porphyry promises some kind of purgation of the
soul by the help of theurgy, though he does so with some
hesitation and shame, and denies that this art can secure to
any one a return to God; so that you can detect his opinion
vacillating between the profession of philosophy and an art
which he feels to be presumptuous and sacrilegious. For at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
one time he warns us to avoid it as deceitful, and prohibited
by law, and dangerous to those who practise it; then again,
as if in deference to its advocates, he declares it useful for
cleansing one part of the soul, not, indeed, the intellectual part,
by which the truth of things intelligible, which have no sensible
images, is recognised, but the spiritual part, which takes cognizance
of the images of things material. This part, he says,
is prepared and fitted for intercourse with spirits and angels,
and for the vision of the gods, by the help of certain theurgic
consecrations, or, as they call them, mysteries. He acknowledges,
however, that these theurgic mysteries impart to the
intellectual soul no such purity as fits it to see its God, and
recognise the things that truly exist. And from this acknowledgment
we may infer what kind of gods these are, and what
kind of vision of them is imparted by theurgic consecrations,
if by it one cannot see the things which truly exist. He says,
further, that the rational, or, as he prefers calling it, the intellectual
soul, can pass into the heavens without the spiritual
part being cleansed by theurgic art, and that this art cannot
so purify the spiritual part as to give it entrance to immortality
and eternity. And therefore, although he distinguishes angels
from demons, asserting that the habitation of the latter is in
the air, while the former dwell in the ether and empyrean,
and although he advises us to cultivate the friendship of some
demon, who may be able after our death to assist us, and
elevate us at least a little above the earth,&mdash;for he owns that
it is by another way we must reach the heavenly society of
the angels,&mdash;he at the same time distinctly warns us to avoid
the society of demons, saying that the soul, expiating its sin
after death, execrates the worship of demons by whom it was
entangled. And of theurgy itself, though he recommends it
as reconciling angels and demons, he cannot deny that it treats
with powers which either themselves envy the soul its purity,
or serve the arts of those who do envy it. He complains of
this through the mouth of some Chaldæan or other: "A good
man in Chaldæa complains," he says, "that his most strenuous
efforts to cleanse his soul were frustrated, because another man,
who had influence in these matters, and who envied him
purity, had prayed to the powers, and bound them by his conjuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
not to listen to his request. Therefore," adds Porphyry,
"what the one man bound, the other could not loose." And
from this he concludes that theurgy is a craft which accomplishes
not only good but evil among gods and men; and that
the gods also have passions, and are perturbed and agitated
by the emotions which Apuleius attributed to demons and
men, but from which he preserved the gods by that sublimity of
residence, which, in common with Plato, he accorded to them.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Concerning theurgy, which promises a delusive purification of the soul
by the invocation of demons.</i></p>

<p>But here we have another and a much more learned Platonist
than Apuleius, Porphyry, to wit, asserting that, by I know
not what theurgy, even the gods themselves are subjected to
passions and perturbations; for by adjurations they were so
bound and terrified that they could not confer purity of soul,&mdash;were
so terrified by him who imposed on them a wicked
command, that they could not by the same theurgy be freed
from that terror, and fulfil the righteous behest of him who
prayed to them, or do the good he sought. Who does not see
that all these things are fictions of deceiving demons, unless
he be a wretched slave of theirs, and an alien from the grace of
the true Liberator? For if the Chaldæan had been dealing
with good gods, certainly a well-disposed man, who sought to
purify his own soul, would have had more influence with them
than an evil-disposed man seeking to hinder him. Or, if the
gods were just, and considered the man unworthy of the
purification he sought, at all events they should not have been
terrified by an envious person, nor hindered, as Porphyry avows,
by the fear of a stronger deity, but should have simply denied
the boon on their own free judgment. And it is surprising
that that well-disposed Chaldæan, who desired to purify his
soul by theurgical rites, found no superior deity who could
either terrify the frightened gods still more, and force them to
confer the boon, or compose their fears, and so enable them to
do good without compulsion,&mdash;even supposing that the good
theurgist had no rites by which he himself might purge away
the taint of fear from the gods whom he invoked for the purification
of his own soul. And why is it that there is a god
who has power to terrify the inferior gods, and none who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
power to free them from fear? Is there found a god who listens
to the envious man, and frightens the gods from doing good?
and is there not found a god who listens to the well-disposed
man, and removes the fear of the gods that they may do him
good? O excellent theurgy! O admirable purification of the
soul!&mdash;a theurgy in which the violence of an impure envy has
more influence than the entreaty of purity and holiness.
Rather let us abominate and avoid the deceit of such wicked
spirits, and listen to sound doctrine. As to those who perform
these filthy cleansings by sacrilegious rites, and see in
their initiated state (as he further tells us, though we may
question this vision) certain wonderfully lovely appearances
of angels or gods, this is what the apostle refers to when he
speaks of "Satan transforming himself into an angel of light."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
For these are the delusive appearances of that spirit who longs
to entangle wretched souls in the deceptive worship of many
and false gods, and to turn them aside from the true worship
of the true God, by whom alone they are cleansed and healed,
and who, as was said of Proteus, "turns himself into all
shapes,"<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> equally hurtful, whether he assaults us as an enemy,
or assumes the disguise of a friend.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of Porphyry's epistle to Anebo, in which he asks for information about
the differences among demons.</i></p>

<p>It was a better tone which Porphyry adopted in his letter
to Anebo the Egyptian, in which, assuming the character of
an inquirer consulting him, he unmasks and explodes these
sacrilegious arts. In that letter, indeed, he repudiates all
demons, whom he maintains to be so foolish as to be attracted
by the sacrificial vapours, and therefore residing not in the
ether, but in the air beneath the moon, and indeed in the
moon itself. Yet he has not the boldness to attribute to all
the demons all the deceptions and malicious and foolish
practices which justly move his indignation. For, though he
acknowledges that as a race demons are foolish, he so far accommodates
himself to popular ideas as to call some of them
benignant demons. He expresses surprise that sacrifices not
only incline the gods, but also compel and force them to do
what men wish; and he is at a loss to understand how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
sun and moon, and other visible celestial bodies,&mdash;for bodies he
does not doubt that they are,&mdash;are considered gods, if the gods
are distinguished from the demons by their incorporeality; also,
if they are gods, how some are called beneficent and others
hurtful, and how they, being corporeal, are numbered with the
gods, who are incorporeal. He inquires further, and still as
one in doubt, whether diviners and wonderworkers are men of
unusually powerful souls, or whether the power to do these
things is communicated by spirits from without. He inclines
to the latter opinion, on the ground that it is by the use of
stones and herbs that they lay spells on people, and open
closed doors, and do similar wonders. And on this account,
he says, some suppose that there is a race of beings whose
property it is to listen to men,&mdash;a race deceitful, full of contrivances,
capable of assuming all forms, simulating gods,
demons, and dead men,&mdash;and that it is this race which brings
about all these things which have the appearance of good or
evil, but that what is really good they never help us in, and
are indeed unacquainted with, for they make wickedness easy,
but throw obstacles in the path of those who eagerly follow
virtue; and that they are filled with pride and rashness,
delight in sacrificial odours, are taken with flattery. These and
the other characteristics of this race of deceitful and malicious
spirits, who come into the souls of men and delude their senses,
both in sleep and waking, he describes not as things of which
he is himself convinced, but only with so much suspicion and
doubt as to cause him to speak of them as commonly received
opinions. We should sympathize with this great philosopher
in the difficulty he experienced in acquainting himself with
and confidently assailing the whole fraternity of devils, which
any Christian old woman would unhesitatingly describe and
most unreservedly detest. Perhaps, however, he shrank from
offending Anebo, to whom he was writing, himself the most
eminent patron of these mysteries, or the others who marvelled
at these magical feats as divine works, and closely allied to
the worship of the gods.</p>

<p>However, he pursues this subject, and, still in the character
of an inquirer, mentions some things which no sober judgment
could attribute to any but malicious and deceitful powers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
He asks why, after the better class of spirits have been invoked,
the worse should be commanded to perform the wicked
desires of men; why they do not hear a man who has just left
a woman's embrace, while they themselves make no scruple of
tempting men to incest and adultery; why their priests are
commanded to abstain from animal food for fear of being polluted
by the corporeal exhalations, while they themselves are
attracted by the fumes of sacrifices and other exhalations;
why the initiated are forbidden to touch a dead body, while
their mysteries are celebrated almost entirely by means of dead
bodies; why it is that a man addicted to any vice should utter
threats, not to a demon or to the soul of a dead man, but to
the sun and moon, or some of the heavenly bodies, which he
intimidates by imaginary terrors, that he may wring from them
a real boon,&mdash;for he threatens that he will demolish the sky,
and such like impossibilities,&mdash;that those gods, being alarmed,
like silly children, with imaginary and absurd threats, may
do what they are ordered. Porphyry further relates that a
man Chæremon, profoundly versed in these sacred or rather
sacrilegious mysteries, had written that the famous Egyptian
mysteries of Isis and her husband Osiris had very great influence
with the gods to compel them to do what they were
ordered, when he who used the spells threatened to divulge
or do away with these mysteries, and cried with a threatening
voice that he would scatter the members of Osiris if they
neglected his orders. Not without reason is Porphyry surprised
that a man should utter such wild and empty threats
against the gods,&mdash;not against gods of no account, but against
the heavenly gods, and those that shine with sidereal light,&mdash;and
that these threats should be effectual to constrain them
with resistless power, and alarm them so that they fulfil his
wishes. Not without reason does he, in the character of an
inquirer into the reasons of these surprising things, give it to
be understood that they are done by that race of spirits which
he previously described as if quoting other people's opinions,&mdash;spirits
who deceive not, as he said, by nature, but by their
own corruption, and who simulate gods and dead men, but
not, as he said, demons, for demons they really are. As to
his idea that by means of herbs, and stones, and animals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
certain incantations and noises, and drawings, sometimes fanciful,
and sometimes copied from the motions of the heavenly
bodies, men create upon earth powers capable of bringing
about various results, all that is only the mystification which
these demons practise on those who are subject to them, for
the sake of furnishing themselves with merriment at the expense
of their dupes. Either, then, Porphyry was sincere in
his doubts and inquiries, and mentioned these things to demonstrate
and put beyond question that they were the work,
not of powers which aid us in obtaining life, but of deceitful
demons; or, to take a more favourable view of the philosopher,
he adopted this method with the Egyptian who was wedded to
these errors, and was proud of them, that he might not offend
him by assuming the attitude of a teacher, nor discompose his
mind by the altercation of a professed assailant, but, by assuming
the character of an inquirer, and the humble attitude
of one who was anxious to learn, might turn his attention
to these matters, and show how worthy they are to be despised
and relinquished. Towards the conclusion of his letter, he
requests Anebo to inform him what the Egyptian wisdom indicates
as the way to blessedness. But as to those who hold
intercourse with the gods, and pester them only for the sake
of finding a runaway slave, or acquiring property, or making a
bargain of a marriage, or such things, he declares that their
pretensions to wisdom are vain. He adds that these same
gods, even granting that on other points their utterances were
true, were yet so ill-advised and unsatisfactory in their disclosures
about blessedness, that they cannot be either gods or
good demons, but are either that spirit who is called the deceiver,
or mere fictions of the imagination.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the miracles wrought by the true God through the ministry of the
holy angels.</i></p>

<p>Since by means of these arts wonders are done which quite
surpass human power, what choice have we but to believe that
these predictions and operations, which seem to be miraculous
and divine, and which at the same time form no part of the worship
of the one God, in adherence to whom, as the Platonists
themselves abundantly testify, all blessedness consists, are the
pastime of wicked spirits, who thus seek to seduce and hinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
the truly godly? On the other hand, we cannot but believe
that all miracles, whether wrought by angels or by other
means, so long as they are so done as to commend the worship
and religion of the one God in whom alone is blessedness, are
wrought by those who love us in a true and godly sort, or
through their means, God Himself working in them. For we
cannot listen to those who maintain that the invisible God
works no visible miracles; for even they believe that He
made the world, which surely they will not deny to be visible.
Whatever marvel happens in this world, it is certainly less
marvellous than this whole world itself,&mdash;I mean the sky and
earth, and all that is in them,&mdash;and these God certainly
made. But, as the Creator Himself is hidden and incomprehensible
to man, so also is the manner of creation.
Although, therefore, the standing miracle of this visible world
is little thought of, because always before us, yet, when we
arouse ourselves to contemplate it, it is a greater miracle than
the rarest and most unheard-of marvels. For man himself is
a greater miracle than any miracle done through his instrumentality.
Therefore God, who made the visible heaven and earth,
does not disdain to work visible miracles in heaven or earth,
that He may thereby awaken the soul which is immersed in
things visible to worship Himself, the Invisible. But the place
and time of these miracles are dependent on His unchangeable
will, in which things future are ordered as if already they were
accomplished. For He moves things temporal without Himself
moving in time. He does not in one way know things that
are to be, and, in another, things that have been; neither does
He listen to those who pray otherwise than as He sees those
that will pray. For, even when His angels hear us, it is He
Himself who hears us in them, as in His true temple not
made with hands, as in those men who are His saints; and
His answers, though accomplished in time, have been arranged
by His eternal appointment.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Of the invisible God, who has often made Himself visible, not as He really is,
but as the beholders could bear the sight.</i></p>

<p>Neither need we be surprised that God, invisible as He is,
should often have appeared visibly to the patriarchs. For
as the sound which communicates the thought conceived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the silence of the mind is not the thought itself, so the form
by which God, invisible in His own nature, became visible,
was not God Himself. Nevertheless it is He Himself who
was seen under that form, as that thought itself is heard in
the sound of the voice; and the patriarchs recognised that,
though the bodily form was not God, they saw the invisible
God. For, though Moses conversed with God, yet he said,
'If I have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thyself, that
I may see and know Thee.'<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> And as it was fit that the law,
which was given, not to one man or a few enlightened men,
but to the whole of a populous nation, should be accompanied
by awe-inspiring signs, great marvels were wrought, by the
ministry of angels, before the people on the mount where the
law was being given to them through one man, while the
multitude beheld the awful appearances. For the people of
Israel believed Moses, not as the Lacedæmonians believed their
Lycurgus, because he had received from Jupiter or Apollo the
laws he gave them. For when the law which enjoined the
worship of one God was given to the people, marvellous signs
and earthquakes, such as the divine wisdom judged sufficient,
were brought about in the sight of all, that they might know
that it was the Creator who could thus use creation to promulgate
His law.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>14. <i>That the one God is to be worshipped not only for the sake of eternal
blessings, but also in connection with temporal prosperity, because all
things are regulated by His providence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The education of the human race, represented by the people
of God, has advanced, like that of an individual, through certain
epochs, or, as it were, ages, so that it might gradually rise
from earthly to heavenly things, and from the visible to the
invisible. This object was kept so clearly in view, that, even
in the period when temporal rewards were promised, the one
God was presented as the object of worship, that men might
not acknowledge any other than the true Creator and Lord of
the spirit, even in connection with the earthly blessings of
this transitory life. For he who denies that all things, which
either angels or men can give us, are in the hand of the one
Almighty, is a madman. The Platonist Plotinus discourses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
concerning providence, and, from the beauty of flowers and
foliage, proves that from the supreme God, whose beauty is
unseen and ineffable, providence reaches down even to these
earthly things here below; and he argues that all these frail
and perishing things could not have so exquisite and elaborate
a beauty, were they not fashioned by Him whose unseen and
unchangeable beauty continually pervades all things.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> This
is proved also by the Lord Jesus, where He says, 'Consider
the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.
And yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothe the grass of
the field, which to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven,
how much more shall He clothe you, O ye of little faith!'<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
It was best, therefore, that the soul of man, which was still
weakly desiring earthly things, should be accustomed to seek
from God alone even these petty temporal boons, and the
earthly necessaries of this transitory life, which are contemptible
in comparison with eternal blessings, in order that the
desire even of these things might not draw it aside from the
worship of Him, to whom we come by despising and forsaking
such things.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the ministry of the holy angels, by which they fulfil the providence
of God.</i></p>

<p>And so it has pleased Divine Providence, as I have said,
and as we read in the Acts of the Apostles,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> that the law
enjoining the worship of one God should be given by the
disposition of angels. But among them the person of God
Himself visibly appeared, not, indeed, in His proper substance,
which ever remains invisible to mortal eyes, but by the infallible
signs furnished by creation in obedience to its Creator.
He made use, too, of the words of human speech, uttering
them syllable by syllable successively, though in His own
nature He speaks not in a bodily but in a spiritual way;
not to sense, but to the mind; not in words that occupy
time, but, if I may so say, eternally, neither beginning to
speak nor coming to an end. And what He says is accurately
heard, not by the bodily but by the mental ear of His ministers
and messengers, who are immortally blessed in the enjoyment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
of His unchangeable truth; and the directions which they in
some ineffable way receive, they execute without delay or
difficulty in the sensible and visible world. And this law
was given in conformity with the age of the world, and contained
at the first earthly promises, as I have said, which,
however, symbolized eternal ones; and these eternal blessings
few understood, though many took a part in the celebration
of their visible signs. Nevertheless, with one consent both
the words and the visible rites of that law enjoin the worship
of one God,&mdash;not one of a crowd of gods, but Him who made
heaven and earth, and every soul and every spirit which is
other than Himself. He created; all else was created; and,
both for being and well-being, all things need Him who
created them.</p>

<p>What angels, then, are we to believe in this matter of blessed

Creator, and teach us to render it with true piety to Him, by

in whom they promise that we shall be so? For that vision
of God is the beauty of a vision so great, and is so infinitely

themselves or these others. If neither the one party nor the
other had wrought miracles, but had merely uttered commands,
the one to sacrifice to themselves, the other forbidding that,
and ordering us to sacrifice to God, a godly mind would have
been at no loss to discern which command proceeded from
proud arrogance, and which from true religion. I will say
more. If miracles had been wrought only by those who demand
sacrifice for themselves, while those who forbade this, and
enjoined sacrificing to the one God only, thought fit entirely
to forego the use of visible miracles, the authority of the latter
was to be preferred by all who would use, not their eyes only,
but their reason. But since God, for the sake of commending
to us the oracles of His truth, has, by means of these immortal
messengers, who proclaim His majesty and not their own pride,
wrought miracles of surpassing grandeur, certainty, and distinctness,
in order that the weak among the godly might not
be drawn away to false religion by those who require us to
sacrifice to them and endeavour to convince us by stupendous
appeals to our senses, who is so utterly unreasonable as not to
choose and follow the truth, when he finds that it is heralded
by even more striking evidences than falsehood?</p>

<p>As for those miracles which history ascribes to the gods
of the heathen,&mdash;I do not refer to those prodigies which at
intervals happen from some unknown physical causes, and
which are arranged and appointed by Divine Providence, such
as monstrous births, and unusual meteorological phenomena,
whether startling only, or also injurious, and which are said
to be brought about and removed by communication with
demons, and by their most deceitful craft,&mdash;but I refer to
these prodigies which manifestly enough are wrought by their
power and force, as, that the household gods which Æneas
carried from Troy in his flight moved from place to place;
that Tarquin cut a whetstone with a razor; that the Epidaurian
serpent attached himself as a companion to Æsculapius on his
voyage to Rome; that the ship in which the image of the
Phrygian mother stood, and which could not be moved by a
host of men and oxen, was moved by one weak woman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
attached her girdle to the vessel and drew it, as proof of her
chastity; that a vestal, whose virginity was questioned, removed
the suspicion by carrying from the Tiber a sieve full of water
without any of it dropping: these, then, and the like, are by
no means to be compared for greatness and virtue to those
which, we read, were wrought among God's people. How
much less can we compare those marvels, which even the laws
of heathen nations prohibit and punish,&mdash;I mean the magical
and theurgic marvels, of which the great part are merely
illusions practised upon the senses, as the drawing down of
the moon, "that," as Lucan says, "it may shed a stronger
influence on the plants?"<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> And if some of these do seem to
equal those which are wrought by the godly, the end for
which they are wrought distinguishes the two, and shows that
ours are incomparably the more excellent. For those miracles
commend the worship of a plurality of gods, who deserve
worship the less the more they demand it; but these of ours
commend the worship of the one God, who, both by the testimony
of His own Scriptures, and by the eventual abolition of
sacrifices, proves that He needs no such offerings. If, therefore,
any angels demand sacrifice for themselves, we must
prefer those who demand it, not for themselves, but for God,
the Creator of all, whom they serve. For thus they prove
how sincerely they love us, since they wish by sacrifice to
subject us, not to themselves, but to Him by the contemplation
of whom they themselves are blessed, and to bring us to Him
from whom they themselves have never strayed. If, on the
other hand, any angels wish us to sacrifice, not to one, but to
many, not, indeed, to themselves, but to the gods whose angels
they are, we must in this case also prefer those who are the
angels of the one God of gods, and who so bid us to worship
Him as to preclude our worshipping any other. But, further,
if it be the case, as their pride and deceitfulness rather indicate,
that they are neither good angels nor the angels of good
gods, but wicked demons, who wish sacrifice to be paid, not to
the one only and supreme God, but to themselves, what better
protection against them can we choose than that of the one
God whom the good angels serve, the angels who bid us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
sacrifice, not to themselves, but to Him whose sacrifice we
ourselves ought to be?</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Concerning the ark of the covenant, and the miraculous signs whereby God
authenticated the law and the promise.</i></p>

<p>On this account it was that the law of God, given by the
disposition of angels, and which commanded that the one God
of gods alone receive sacred worship, to the exclusion of all
others, was deposited in the ark, called the ark of the testimony.
By this name it is sufficiently indicated, not that
God, who was worshipped by all those rites, was shut up and
enclosed in that place, though His responses emanated from
it along with signs appreciable by the senses, but that His
will was declared from that throne. The law itself, too, was
engraven on tables of stone, and, as I have said, deposited in
the ark, which the priests carried with due reverence during
the sojourn in the wilderness, along with the tabernacle, which
was in like manner called the tabernacle of the testimony;
and there was then an accompanying sign, which appeared as
a cloud by day and as a fire by night; when the cloud
moved, the camp was shifted, and where it stood the camp
was pitched. Besides these signs, and the voices which proceeded
from the place where the ark was, there were other
miraculous testimonies to the law. For when the ark was
carried across Jordan, on the entrance to the land of promise,
the upper part of the river stopped in its course, and the
lower part flowed on, so as to present both to the ark and the
people dry ground to pass over. Then, when it was carried
seven times round the first hostile and polytheistic city they
came to, its walls suddenly fell down, though assaulted by no
hand, struck by no battering-ram. Afterwards, too, when
they were now resident in the land of promise, and the ark
had, in punishment of their sin, been taken by their enemies,
its captors triumphantly placed it in the temple of their
favourite god, and left it shut up there, but, on opening the
temple next day, they found the image they used to pray to
fallen to the ground and shamefully shattered. Then, being
themselves alarmed by portents, and still more shamefully
punished, they restored the ark of the testimony to the people
from whom they had taken it. And what was the manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
its restoration? They placed it on a wagon, and yoked to
it cows from which they had taken the calves, and let
them choose their own course, expecting that in this way the
divine will would be indicated; and the cows, without any
man driving or directing them, steadily pursued the way to
the Hebrews, without regarding the lowing of their calves,
and thus restored the ark to its worshippers. To God these
and such like wonders are small, but they are mighty to terrify
and give wholesome instruction to men. For if philosophers,
and especially the Platonists, are with justice esteemed wiser
than other men, as I have just been mentioning, because they
taught that even these earthly and insignificant things are
ruled by Divine Providence, inferring this from the numberless
beauties which are observable not only in the bodies of animals,
but even in plants and grasses, how much more plainly do
these things attest the presence of divinity which happen at
the time predicted, and in which that religion is commended
which forbids the offering of sacrifice to any celestial, terrestrial,
or infernal being, and commands it to be offered to God only,
who alone blesses us by His love for us, and by our love to
Him, and who, by arranging the appointed times of those
sacrifices, and by predicting that they were to pass into a better
sacrifice by a better Priest, testified that He has no appetite
for these sacrifices, but through them indicated others of more
substantial blessing,&mdash;and all this not that He Himself may
be glorified by these honours, but that we may be stirred up
to worship and cleave to Him, being inflamed by His love,
which is our advantage rather than His?</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Against those who deny that the books of the Church are to be believed about
the miracles whereby the people of God were educated.</i></p>

<p>Will some one say that these miracles are false, that they
never happened, and that the records of them are lies? Whoever
says so, and asserts that in such matters no records whatever
can be credited, may also say that there are no gods who
care for human affairs. For they have induced men to worship
them only by means of miraculous works, which the
heathen histories testify, and by which the gods have made a
display of their own power rather than done any real service.
This is the reason why we have not undertaken in this work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
of which we are now writing the tenth book, to refute those
who either deny that there is any divine power, or contend
that it does not interfere with human affairs, but those who
prefer their own god to our God, the Founder of the holy and
most glorious city, not knowing that He is also the invisible
and unchangeable Founder of this visible and changing world,
and the truest bestower of the blessed life which resides not
in things created, but in Himself. For thus speaks His most
trustworthy prophet: "It is good for me to be united to God."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
Among philosophers it is a question, what is that end and
good to the attainment of which all our duties are to have a
relation? The Psalmist did not say, It is good for me to have
great wealth, or to wear imperial insignia, purple, sceptre,
and diadem; or, as some even of the philosophers have not
blushed to say, It is good for me to enjoy sensual pleasure;
or, as the better men among them seemed to say, My good is
my spiritual strength; but, "It is good for me to be united
to God." This he had learned from Him whom the holy
angels, with the accompanying witness of miracles, presented
as the sole object of worship. And hence he himself became
the sacrifice of God, whose spiritual love inflamed him, and
into whose ineffable and incorporeal embrace he yearned to
cast himself. Moreover, if the worshippers of many gods
(whatever kind of gods they fancy their own to be) believe
that the miracles recorded in their civil histories, or in the
books of magic, or of the more respectable theurgy, were
wrought by these gods, what reason have they for refusing
to believe the miracles recorded in those writings, to which
we owe a credence as much greater as He is greater to whom
alone these writings teach us to sacrifice?</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>On the reasonableness of offering, as the true religion teaches, a visible
sacrifice to the one true and invisible God.</i></p>

<p>As to those who think that these visible sacrifices are suitably
offered to other gods, but that invisible sacrifices, the
graces of purity of mind and holiness of will, should be offered,
as greater and better, to the invisible God, Himself greater
and better than all others, they must be oblivious that these
visible sacrifices are signs of the invisible, as the words we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
utter are the signs of things. And therefore, as in prayer or
praise we direct intelligible words to Him to whom in our
heart we offer the very feelings we are expressing, so we are
to understand that in sacrifice we offer visible sacrifice only
to Him to whom in our heart we ought to present ourselves
an invisible sacrifice. It is then that the angels, and all those
superior powers who are mighty by their goodness and piety,
regard us with pleasure, and rejoice with us and assist us to
the utmost of their power. But if we offer such worship to
them, they decline it; and when on any mission to men they
become visible to the senses, they positively forbid it. Examples
of this occur in holy writ. Some fancied they should,
by adoration or sacrifice, pay the same honour to angels as is
due to God, and were prevented from doing so by the angels
themselves, and ordered to render it to Him to whom alone
they know it to be due. And the holy angels have in this
been imitated by holy men of God. For Paul and Barnabas,
when they had wrought a miracle of healing in Lycaonia, were
thought to be gods, and the Lycaonians desired to sacrifice to
them, and they humbly and piously declined this honour, and
announced to them the God in whom they should believe.
And those deceitful and proud spirits, who exact worship, do
so simply because they know it to be due to the true God.
For that which they take pleasure in is not, as Porphyry says
and some fancy, the smell of the victims, but divine honours.
They have, in fact, plenty odours on all hands, and if they
wished more, they could provide them for themselves. But
the spirits who arrogate to themselves divinity are delighted
not with the smoke of carcases, but with the suppliant spirit
which they deceive and hold in subjection, and hinder from
drawing near to God, preventing him from offering himself in
sacrifice to God by inducing him to sacrifice to others.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the supreme and true sacrifice which was effected by the Mediator between
God and men.</i></p>

<p>And hence that true Mediator, in so far as, by assuming
the form of a servant, He became the Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, though in the form of God
He received sacrifice together with the Father, with whom He
is one God, yet in the form of a servant He chose rather to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
be than to receive a sacrifice, that not even by this instance
any one might have occasion to suppose that sacrifice should
be rendered to any creature. Thus He is both the Priest
who offers and the Sacrifice offered. And He designed that
there should be a daily sign of this in the sacrifice of the
Church, which, being His body, learns to offer herself through
Him. Of this true Sacrifice the ancient sacrifices of the saints
were the various and numerous signs; and it was thus variously
figured, just as one thing is signified by a variety of words,
that there may be less weariness when we speak of it much.
To this supreme and true sacrifice all false sacrifices have
given place.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>21. <i>Of the power delegated to demons for the trial and glorification of the saints,
who conquer not by propitiating the spirits of the air, but by abiding in
God.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The power delegated to the demons at certain appointed
and well-adjusted seasons, that they may give expression
to their hostility to the city of God by stirring up against
it the men who are under their influence, and may not
only receive sacrifice from those who willingly offer it,
but may also extort it from the unwilling by violent persecution;&mdash;this
power is found to be not merely harmless, but
even useful to the Church, completing as it does the number
of martyrs, whom the city of God esteems as all the more
illustrious and honoured citizens, because they have striven
even to blood against the sin of impiety. If the ordinary
language of the Church allowed it, we might more elegantly
call these men our heroes. For this name is said to be
derived from Juno, who in Greek is called Hêrê, and hence,
according to the Greek myths, one of her sons was called
Heros. And these fables mystically signified that Juno was
mistress of the air, which they suppose to be inhabited by
the demons and the heroes, understanding by heroes the souls
of the well-deserving dead. But for a quite opposite reason
would we call our martyrs heroes,&mdash;supposing, as I said, that
the usage of ecclesiastical language would admit of it,&mdash;not
because they lived along with the demons in the air, but
because they conquered these demons or powers of the air,
and among them Juno herself, be she what she may, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
unsuitably represented, as she commonly is by the poets, as
hostile to virtue, and jealous of men of mark aspiring to the
heavens. Virgil, however, unhappily gives way, and yields to
her; for, though he represents her as saying, "I am conquered
by Æneas,"<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Helenus gives Æneas himself this religious
advice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pay vows to Juno: overbear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her queenly soul with gift and prayer."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In conformity with this opinion, Porphyry&mdash;expressing, however,
not so much his own views as other people's&mdash;says that
a good god or genius cannot come to a man unless the evil
genius has been first of all propitiated, implying that the evil
deities had greater power than the good; for, until they have
been appeased and give place, the good can give no assistance;
and if the evil deities oppose, the good can give no
help; whereas the evil can do injury without the good being
able to prevent them. This is not the way of the true and
truly holy religion; not thus do our martyrs conquer Juno,
that is to say, the powers of the air, who envy the virtues of
the pious. Our heroes, if we could so call them, overcome
Hêrê, not by suppliant gifts, but by divine virtues. As
Scipio, who conquered Africa by his valour, is more suitably
styled Africanus than if he had appeased his enemies
by gifts, and so won their mercy.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Whence the saints derive power against demons and true purification
of heart.</i></p>

<p>It is by true piety that men of God cast out the hostile
power of the air which opposes godliness; it is by exorcising
it, not by propitiating it; and they overcome all the temptations
of the adversary by praying, not to him, but to their
own God against him. For the devil cannot conquer or
subdue any but those who are in league with sin; and
therefore he is conquered in the name of Him who assumed
humanity, and that without sin, that Himself being both
Priest and Sacrifice, He might bring about the remission of
sins, that is to say, might bring it about through the Mediator
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, by whom we are
reconciled to God, the cleansing from sin being accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
For men are separated from God only by sins, from which we
are in this life cleansed not by our own virtue, but by the
divine compassion; through His indulgence, not through our
own power. For, whatever virtue we call our own is itself
bestowed upon us by His goodness. And we might attribute
too much to ourselves while in the flesh, unless we lived in
the receipt of pardon until we laid it down. This is the
reason why there has been vouchsafed to us, through the
Mediator, this grace, that we who are polluted by sinful flesh
should be cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh. By this
grace of God, wherein He has shown His great compassion
toward us, we are both governed by faith in this life, and,
after this life, are led onwards to the fullest perfection by the
vision of immutable truth.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the principles which, according to the Platonists, regulate the
purification of the soul.</i></p>

<p>Even Porphyry asserts that it was revealed by divine
oracles that we are not purified by any sacrifices<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> to sun
or moon, meaning it to be inferred that we are not purified
by sacrificing to any gods. For what mysteries can purify,
if those of the sun and moon, which are esteemed the chief
of the celestial gods, do not purify? He says, too, in the
same place, that "principles" can purify, lest it should be
supposed, from his saying that sacrificing to the sun and
moon cannot purify, that sacrificing to some other of the host
of gods might do so. And what he as a Platonist means by
"principles," we know.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> For he speaks of God the Father and
God the Son, whom he calls (writing in Greek) the intellect
or mind of the Father;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> but of the Holy Spirit he says either
nothing, or nothing plainly, for I do not understand what other
he speaks of as holding the middle place between these two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
For if, like Plotinus in his discussion regarding the three
principal substances,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> he wished us to understand by this
third the soul of nature, he would certainly not have given
it the middle place between these two, that is, between the
Father and the Son. For Plotinus places the soul of nature
after the intellect of the Father, while Porphyry, making it
the mean, does not place it after, but between the others.
No doubt he spoke according to his light, or as he thought
expedient; but we assert that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit
not of the Father only, nor of the Son only, but of both.
For philosophers speak as they have a mind to, and in the
most difficult matters do not scruple to offend religious ears;
but we are bound to speak according to a certain rule, lest
freedom of speech beget impiety of opinion about the matters
themselves of which we speak.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the one only true principle which alone purifies and renews
human nature.</i></p>

<p>Accordingly, when we speak of God, we do not affirm two
or three principles, no more than we are at liberty to affirm
two or three gods; although, speaking of each, of the Father,
or of the Son, or of the Holy Ghost, we confess that each is
God: and yet we do not say, as the Sabellian heretics say,
that the Father is the same as the Son, and the Holy Spirit
the same as the Father and the Son; but we say that the
Father is the Father of the Son, and the Son the Son of the
Father, and that the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son
is neither the Father nor the Son. It was therefore truly
said that man is cleansed only by a Principle, although the
Platonists erred in speaking in the plural of <i>principles</i>. But
Porphyry, being under the dominion of these envious powers,
whose influence he was at once ashamed of and afraid to
throw off, refused to recognise that Christ is the Principle by
whose incarnation we are purified. Indeed he despised Him,
because of the flesh itself which He assumed, that He might
offer a sacrifice for our purification,&mdash;a great mystery, unintelligible
to Porphyry's pride, which that true and benignant
Redeemer brought low by His humility, manifesting Himself
to mortals by the mortality which He assumed, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
the malignant and deceitful mediators are proud of wanting,
promising, as the boon of immortals, a deceptive assistance to
wretched men. Thus the good and true Mediator showed
that it is sin which is evil, and not the substance or nature
of flesh; for this, together with the human soul, could without
sin be both assumed and retained, and laid down in death,
and changed to something better by resurrection. He showed
also that death itself, although the punishment of sin, was
submitted to by Him for our sakes without sin, and must
not be evaded by sin on our part, but rather, if opportunity
serves, be borne for righteousness' sake. For he was able
to expiate sins by dying, because He both died, and not for
sin of His own. But He has not been recognised by Porphyry
as the Principle, otherwise he would have recognised
Him as the Purifier. The Principle is neither the flesh nor
the human soul in Christ, but the Word by which all things
were made. The flesh, therefore, does not by its own virtue
purify, but by virtue of the Word by which it was assumed,
when "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> For,
speaking mystically of eating His flesh, when those who did
not understand Him were offended and went away, saying,
"This is an hard saying, who can hear it?" He answered to
the rest who remained, "It is the Spirit that quickeneth;
the flesh profiteth nothing."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The Principle, therefore, having
assumed a human soul and flesh, cleanses the soul and flesh
of believers. Therefore, when the Jews asked Him who He
was, He answered that He was the <i>Principle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> And this we
carnal and feeble men, liable to sin, and involved in the darkness
of ignorance, could not possibly understand, unless we
were cleansed and healed by Him, both by means of what we
were, and of what we were not. For we were men, but we
were not righteous; whereas in His incarnation there was a
human nature, but it was righteous, and not sinful. This
is the mediation whereby a hand is stretched to the lapsed
and fallen; this is the seed "ordained by angels," by whose
ministry the law also was given enjoining the worship of one
God, and promising that this Mediator should come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">25. <i>That all the saints, both under the law and before it, were justified by faith
in the mystery of Christ's incarnation.</i></p>

<p>It was by faith in this mystery, and godliness of life, that
purification was attainable even by the saints of old, whether
before the law was given to the Hebrews (for God and the
angels were even then present as instructors), or in the periods
under the law, although the promises of spiritual things, being
presented in figure, seemed to be carnal, and hence the name
of Old Testament. For it was then the prophets lived, by
whom, as by angels, the same promise was announced; and
among them was he whose grand and divine sentiment regarding
the end and supreme good of man I have just now quoted,
"It is good for me to cleave to God."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> In this psalm the distinction
between the Old and New Testaments is distinctly
announced. For the Psalmist says, that when he saw that
the carnal and earthly promises were abundantly enjoyed by
the ungodly, his feet were almost gone, his steps had well-nigh
slipped; and that it seemed to him as if he had served
God in vain, when he saw that those who despised God increased
in that prosperity which he looked for at God's hand.
He says, too, that, in investigating this matter with the desire
of understanding why it was so, he had laboured in vain,
until he went into the sanctuary of God, and understood the
end of those whom he had erroneously considered happy.
Then he understood that they were cast down by that very
thing, as he says, which they had made their boast, and that
they had been consumed and perished for their iniquities;
and that that whole fabric of temporal prosperity had become
as a dream when one awaketh, and suddenly finds himself
destitute of all the joys he had imaged in sleep. And, as
in this earth or earthy city they seemed to themselves to be
great, he says, "O Lord, in Thy city Thou wilt reduce their
image to nothing." He also shows how beneficial it had
been for him to seek even earthly blessings only from the
one true God, in whose power are all things, for he says, "As
a beast was I before Thee, and I am always with Thee." "As
a beast," he says, meaning that he was stupid. For I ought
to have sought from Thee such things as the ungodly could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
not enjoy as well as I, and not those things which I saw
them enjoying in abundance, and hence concluded I was serving
Thee in vain, because they who declined to serve Thee
had what I had not. Nevertheless, "I am always with Thee,"
because even in my desire for such things I did not pray to
other gods. And consequently he goes on, "Thou hast holden
me by my right hand, and by Thy counsel Thou hast guided
me, and with glory hast taken me up;" as if all earthly advantages
were left-hand blessings, though, when he saw them
enjoyed by the wicked, his feet had almost gone. "For what,"
he says, "have I in heaven, and what have I desired from
Thee upon earth?" He blames himself, and is justly displeased
with himself; because, though he had in heaven so
vast a possession (as he afterwards understood), he yet sought
from his God on earth a transitory and fleeting happiness,&mdash;a
happiness of mire, we may say. "My heart and my flesh," he
says, "fail, O God of my heart." Happy failure, from things
below to things above! And hence in another psalm he
says, "My soul longeth, yea, even faileth, for the courts of the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Yet, though he had said of both his heart and his
flesh that they were failing, he did not say, O God of my
heart and my flesh, but, O God of my heart; for by the
heart the flesh is made clean. Therefore, says the Lord,
"Cleanse that which is within, and the outside shall be clean
also."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> He then says that God Himself,&mdash;not anything
received from Him, but Himself,&mdash;is his portion. "The God
of my heart, and my portion for ever." Among the various
objects of human choice, God alone satisfied him. "For, lo,"
he says, "they that are far from Thee shall perish: Thou destroyest
all them that go a-whoring from Thee,"&mdash;that is, who
prostitute themselves to many gods. And then follows the
verse for which all the rest of the psalm seems to prepare:
"It is good for me to cleave to God,"&mdash;not to go far off; not
to go a-whoring with a multitude of gods. And then shall
this union with God be perfected, when all that is to be redeemed
in us has been redeemed. But for the present we
must, as he goes on to say, "place our hope in God." "For
that which is seen," says the apostle, "is not hope. For what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
Being, then, for the present established in this hope, let us do
what the Psalmist further indicates, and become in our measure
angels or messengers of God, declaring His will, and
praising His glory and His grace. For when he had said,
"To place my hope in God," he goes on, "that I may declare
all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion." This
is the most glorious city of God; this is the city which knows
and worships one God: she is celebrated by the holy angels,
who invite us to their society, and desire us to become fellow-citizens
with them in this city; for they do not wish us to
worship them as our gods, but to join them in worshipping
their God and ours; nor to sacrifice to them, but, together with
them, to become a sacrifice to God. Accordingly, whoever
will lay aside malignant obstinacy, and consider these things,
shall be assured that all these blessed and immortal spirits,
who do not envy us (for if they envied they were not blessed),
but rather love us, and desire us to be as blessed as themselves,
look on us with greater pleasure, and give us greater
assistance, when we join them in worshipping one God,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, than if we were to offer to
themselves sacrifice and worship.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Of Porphyry's weakness in wavering between the confession of the true God
and the worship of demons.</i></p>

<p>I know not how it is so, but it seems to me that Porphyry
blushed for his friends the theurgists; for he knew all that
I have adduced, but did not frankly condemn polytheistic
worship. He said, in fact, that there are some angels who
visit earth, and reveal divine truth to theurgists, and others
who publish on earth the things that belong to the Father,
His height and depth. Can we believe, then, that the angels
whose office it is to declare the will of the Father, wish us to
be subject to any but Him whose will they declare? And
hence, even this Platonist himself judiciously observes that we
should rather imitate than invoke them. We ought not, then,
to fear that we may offend these immortal and happy subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
of the one God by not sacrificing to them; for this they
know to be due only to the one true God, in allegiance to
whom they themselves find their blessedness, and therefore
they will not have it given to them, either in figure or in the
reality, which the mysteries of sacrifice symbolized. Such
arrogance belongs to proud and wretched demons, whose disposition
is diametrically opposite to the piety of those who are
subject to God, and whose blessedness consists in attachment
to Him. And, that we also may attain to this bliss, they aid
us, as is fit, with sincere kindliness, and usurp over us no
dominion, but declare to us Him under whose rule we are then
fellow-subjects. Why, then, O philosopher, do you still fear
to speak freely against the powers which are inimical both to
true virtue and to the gifts of the true God? Already you
have discriminated between the angels who proclaim God's
will, and those who visit theurgists, drawn down by I know
not what art. Why do you still ascribe to these latter the
honour of declaring divine truth? If they do not declare the
will of the Father, what divine revelations can they make?
Are not these the evil spirits who were bound over by the
incantations of an envious man,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> that they should not grant
purity of soul to another, and could not, as you say, be set
free from these bonds by a good man anxious for purity, and
recover power over their own actions? Do you still doubt
whether these are wicked demons; or do you, perhaps, feign
ignorance, that you may not give offence to the theurgists, who
have allured you by their secret rites, and have taught you,
as a mighty boon, these insane and pernicious devilries? Do
you dare to elevate above the air, and even to heaven, these
envious powers, or pests, let me rather call them, less worthy
of the name of sovereign than of slaves, as you yourself own;
and are you not ashamed to place them even among your
sidereal gods, and so put a slight upon the stars themselves?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the impiety of Porphyry, which is worse than even the mistake of
Apuleius.</i></p>

<p>How much more tolerable and accordant with human feeling
is the error of your Platonist co-sectary Apuleius! for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
attributed the diseases and storms of human passions only
to the demons who occupy a grade beneath the moon, and
makes even this avowal as by constraint regarding gods whom
he honours; but the superior and celestial gods, who inhabit
the ethereal regions, whether visible, as the sun, moon, and
other luminaries, whose brilliancy makes them conspicuous, or
invisible, but believed in by him, he does his utmost to remove
beyond the slightest stain of these perturbations. It is
not, then, from Plato, but from your Chaldæan teachers you
have learned to elevate human vices to the ethereal and empyreal
regions of the world and to the celestial firmament,
in order that your theurgists might be able to obtain from
your gods divine revelations; and yet you make yourself
superior to these divine revelations by your intellectual life,
which dispenses with these theurgic purifications as not
needed by a philosopher. But, by way of rewarding your
teachers, you recommend these arts to other men, who, not
being philosophers, may be persuaded to use what you acknowledge
to be useless to yourself, who are capable of higher
things; so that those who cannot avail themselves of the
virtue of philosophy, which is too arduous for the multitude,
may, at your instigation, betake themselves to theurgists by
whom they may be purified, not, indeed, in the intellectual, but
in the spiritual part of the soul. Now, as the persons who are
unfit for philosophy form incomparably the majority of mankind,
more may be compelled to consult these secret and illicit
teachers of yours than frequent the Platonic schools. For
these most impure demons, pretending to be ethereal gods,
whose herald and messenger you have become, have promised
that those who are purified by theurgy in the spiritual part of
their soul shall not indeed return to the Father, but shall
dwell among the ethereal gods above the aerial regions. But
such fancies are not listened to by the multitudes of men
whom Christ came to set free from the tyranny of demons.
For in Him they have the most gracious cleansing, in which
mind, spirit, and body alike participate. For, in order that
He might heal the whole man from the plague of sin, He
took without sin the whole human nature. Would that you
had known Him, and would that you had committed yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
for healing to Him rather than to your own frail and infirm
human virtue, or to pernicious and curious arts! He would
not have deceived you; for Him your own oracles, on your
own showing, acknowledged holy and immortal. It is of Him,
too, that the most famous poet speaks, poetically indeed, since
he applies it to the person of another, yet truly, if you refer it
to Christ, saying, "Under thine auspices, if any traces of our
crimes remain, they shall be obliterated, and earth freed from
its perpetual fear."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> By which he indicates that, by reason of
the infirmity which attaches to this life, the greatest progress in
virtue and righteousness leaves room for the existence, if not
of crimes, yet of the traces of crimes, which are obliterated only
by that Saviour of whom this verse speaks. For that he
did not say this at the prompting of his own fancy, Virgil tells
us in almost the last verse of that 4th Eclogue, when he
says, "The last age predicted by the Cumæan sibyl has now
arrived;" whence it plainly appears that this had been dictated
by the Cumæan sibyl. But those theurgists, or rather
demons, who assume the appearance and form of gods, pollute
rather than purify the human spirit by false appearances and
the delusive mockery of unsubstantial forms. How can those
whose own spirit is unclean cleanse the spirit of man? Were
they not unclean, they would not be bound by the incantations
of an envious man, and would neither be afraid nor grudge
to bestow that hollow boon which they promise. But it is
sufficient for our purpose that you acknowledge that the intellectual
soul, that is, our mind, cannot be justified by
theurgy; and that even the spiritual or inferior part of our
soul cannot by this act be made eternal and immortal, though
you maintain that it can be purified by it. Christ, however,
promises life eternal; and therefore to Him the world flocks,
greatly to your indignation, greatly also to your astonishment
and confusion. What avails your forced avowal that theurgy
leads men astray, and deceives vast numbers by its ignorant
and foolish teaching, and that it is the most manifest mistake
to have recourse by prayer and sacrifice to angels and principalities,
when at the same time, to save yourself from the
charge of spending labour in vain on such arts, you direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
men to the theurgists, that by their means men, who do not
live by the rule of the intellectual soul, may have their spiritual
soul purified?</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap28"></a>28. <i>How it is that Porphyry has been so blind as not to recognise the true
wisdom&mdash;Christ.</i></p>

<p>You drive men, therefore, into the most palpable error. And
yet you are not ashamed of doing so much harm, though
you call yourself a lover of virtue and wisdom. Had you
been true and faithful in this profession, you would have recognised
Christ, the virtue of God and the wisdom of God,
and would not, in the pride of vain science, have revolted from
His wholesome humility. Nevertheless you acknowledge that
the spiritual part of the soul can be purified by the virtue of
chastity without the aid of those theurgic arts and mysteries
which you wasted your time in learning. You even say,
sometimes, that these mysteries do not raise the soul after
death, so that, after the termination of this life, they seem to be
of no service even to the part you call spiritual; and yet you
recur on every opportunity to these arts, for no other purpose,
so far as I see, than to appear an accomplished theurgist, and
gratify those who are curious in illicit arts, or else to inspire
others with the same curiosity. But we give you all praise
for saying that this art is to be feared, both on account of the
legal enactments against it, and by reason of the danger involved
in the very practice of it. And would that in this,
at least, you were listened to by its wretched votaries, that
they might be withdrawn from entire absorption in it, or might
even be preserved from tampering with it at all! You say,
indeed, that ignorance, and the numberless vices resulting from
it, cannot be removed by any mysteries, but only by the &#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;
&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;, that is, the Father's mind or intellect conscious of
the Father's will. But that Christ is this mind you do not
believe; for Him you despise on account of the body He took
of a woman and the shame of the cross; for your lofty wisdom
spurns such low and contemptible things, and soars to more
exalted regions. But He fulfils what the holy prophets truly
predicted regarding Him: "I will destroy the wisdom of the
wise, and bring to nought the prudence of the prudent."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
For He does not destroy and bring to nought His own gift in
them, but what they arrogate to themselves, and do not hold
of Him. And hence the apostle, having quoted this testimony
from the prophet, adds, "Where is the wise? where is the
scribe? where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God
made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in
the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it
pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek
after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews
a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto
them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness
of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is
stronger than men."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> This is despised as a weak and foolish
thing by those who are wise and strong in themselves; yet
this is the grace which heals the weak, who do not proudly
boast a blessedness of their own, but rather humbly acknowledge
their real misery.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, which the Platonists
in their impiety blush to acknowledge.</i></p>

<p>You proclaim the Father and His Son, whom you call the
Father's intellect or mind, and between these a third, by whom
we suppose you mean the Holy Spirit, and in your own fashion
you call these three Gods. In this, though your expressions
are inaccurate, you do in some sort, and as through a veil, see
what we should strive towards; but the incarnation of the
unchangeable Son of God, whereby we are saved, and are
enabled to reach the things we believe, or in part understand,
this is what you refuse to recognise. You see in a fashion,
although at a distance, although with filmy eye, the country
in which we should abide; but the way to it you know not.
Yet you believe in grace, for you say it is granted to few to
reach God by virtue of intelligence. For you do not say, "Few
have thought fit or have wished," but, "It has been granted
to few,"&mdash;distinctly acknowledging God's grace, not man's
sufficiency. You also use this word more expressly, when, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
accordance with the opinion of Plato, you make no doubt that
in this life a man cannot by any means attain to perfect
wisdom, but that whatever is lacking is in the future life
made up to those who live intellectually, by God's providence
and grace. Oh, had you but recognised the grace of God in
Jesus Christ our Lord, and that very incarnation of His,
wherein He assumed a human soul and body, you might
have seemed the brightest example of grace!<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> But what am
I doing? I know it is useless to speak to a dead man,&mdash;useless,
at least, so far as regards you, but perhaps not in
vain for those who esteem you highly, and love you on
account of their love of wisdom or curiosity about those arts
which you ought not to have learned; and these persons I
address in your name. The grace of God could not have
been more graciously commended to us than thus, that the
only Son of God, remaining unchangeable in Himself, should
assume humanity, and should give us the hope of His love,
by means of the mediation of a human nature, through which
we, from the condition of men, might come to Him who was so
far off,&mdash;the immortal from the mortal; the unchangeable from
the changeable; the just from the unjust; the blessed from
the wretched. And, as He had given us a natural instinct to
desire blessedness and immortality, He Himself continuing
to be blessed, but assuming mortality, by enduring what we
fear, taught us to despise it, that what we long for He might
bestow upon us.</p>

<p>But in order to your acquiescence in this truth, it is lowliness
that is requisite, and to this it is extremely difficult to bend
you. For what is there incredible, especially to men like you,
accustomed to speculation, which might have predisposed you
to believe in this,&mdash;what is there incredible, I say, in the
assertion that God assumed a human soul and body? You
yourselves ascribe such excellence to the intellectual soul,
which is, after all, the human soul, that you maintain that it
can become consubstantial with that intelligence of the Father
whom you believe in as the Son of God. What incredible
thing is it, then, if some one soul be assumed by Him in an
ineffable and unique manner for the salvation of many?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
Moreover, our nature itself testifies that a man is incomplete
unless a body be united with the soul. This certainly would
be more incredible, were it not of all things the most common;
for we should more easily believe in a union between spirit
and spirit, or, to use your own terminology, between the
incorporeal and the incorporeal, even though the one were
human, the other divine, the one changeable and the other
unchangeable, than in a union between the corporeal and the
incorporeal. But perhaps it is the unprecedented birth of a
body from a virgin that staggers you? But, so far from this
being a difficulty, it ought rather to assist you to receive our
religion, that a miraculous person was born miraculously. Or,
do you find a difficulty in the fact that, after His body had
been given up to death, and had been changed into a higher
kind of body by resurrection, and was now no longer mortal
but incorruptible, He carried it up into heavenly places?
Perhaps you refuse to believe this, because you remember that
Porphyry, in these very books from which I have cited so
much, and which treat of the return of the soul, so frequently
teaches that a body of every kind is to be escaped from, in
order that the soul may dwell in blessedness with God. But
here, in place of following Porphyry, you ought rather to have
corrected him, especially since you agree with him in believing
such incredible things about the soul of this visible world and
huge material frame. For, as scholars of Plato, you hold that
the world is an animal, and a very happy animal, which you
wish to be also everlasting. How, then, is it never to be loosed
from a body, and yet never lose its happiness, if, in order to
the happiness of the soul, the body must be left behind? The
sun, too, and the other stars, you not only acknowledge to be
bodies, in which you have the cordial assent of all seeing men,
but also, in obedience to what you reckon a profounder insight,
you declare that they are very blessed animals, and eternal,
together with their bodies. Why is it, then, that when the
Christian faith is pressed upon you, you forget, or pretend to
ignore, what you habitually discuss or teach? Why is it that
you refuse to be Christians, on the ground that you hold
opinions which, in fact, you yourselves demolish? Is it not
because Christ came in lowliness, and ye are proud? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
precise nature of the resurrection bodies of the saints may
sometimes occasion discussion among those who are best read
in the Christian Scriptures; yet there is not among us the
smallest doubt that they shall be everlasting, and of a nature
exemplified in the instance of Christ's risen body. But whatever
be their nature, since we maintain that they shall be
absolutely incorruptible and immortal, and shall offer no
hindrance to the soul's contemplation by which it is fixed
in God, and as you say that among the celestials the bodies
of the eternally blessed are eternal, why do you maintain that,
in order to blessedness, every body must be escaped from?
Why do you thus seek such a plausible reason for escaping
from the Christian faith, if not because, as I again say, Christ
is humble and ye proud? Are ye ashamed to be corrected?
This is the vice of the proud. It is, forsooth, a degradation
for learned men to pass from the school of Plato to the discipleship
of Christ, who by His Spirit taught a fisherman to think
and to say, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and
without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him
was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
The old saint Simplicianus, afterwards bishop of Milan, used to
tell me that a certain Platonist was in the habit of saying that
this opening passage of the holy gospel, entitled "According
to John," should be written in letters of gold, and hung up in
all churches in the most conspicuous place. But the proud
scorn to take God for their Master, because "the Word was
made flesh and dwelt among us."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> So that, with these miserable
creatures, it is not enough that they are sick, but they boast
of their sickness, and are ashamed of the medicine which could
heal them. And, doing so, they secure not elevation, but a more
disastrous fall.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap30"></a>30. <i>Porphyry's emendations and modifications of Platonism.</i></p>

<p>If it is considered unseemly to emend anything which Plato
has touched, why did Porphyry himself make emendations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
and these not a few? for it is very certain that Plato wrote
that the souls of men return after death to the bodies of
beasts.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Plotinus also, Porphyry's teacher, held this opinion;<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
yet Porphyry justly rejected it. He was of opinion that
human souls return indeed into human bodies, but not into
the bodies they had left, but other new bodies. He shrank
from the other opinion, lest a woman who had returned into
a mule might possibly carry her own son on her back. He
did not shrink, however, from a theory which admitted the
possibility of a mother coming back into a girl and marrying
her own son. How much more honourable a creed is that
which was taught by the holy and truthful angels, uttered by
the prophets who were moved by God's Spirit, preached by
Him who was foretold as the coming Saviour by His forerunning
heralds, and by the apostles whom He sent forth,
and who filled the whole world with the gospel,&mdash;how much
more honourable, I say, is the belief that souls return once
for all to their own bodies, than that they return again and
again to divers bodies? Nevertheless Porphyry, as I have
said, did considerably improve upon this opinion, in so far, at
least, as he maintained that human souls could transmigrate
only into human bodies, and made no scruple about demolishing
the bestial prisons into which Plato had wished to cast
them. He says, too, that God put the soul into the world
that it might recognise the evils of matter, and return to the
Father, and be for ever emancipated from the polluting contact
of matter. And although here is some inappropriate
thinking (for the soul is rather given to the body that it may
do good; for it would not learn evil unless it did it), yet he
corrects the opinion of other Platonists, and that on a point
of no small importance, inasmuch as he avows that the soul,
which is purged from all evil and received to the Father's
presence, shall never again suffer the ills of this life. By
this opinion he quite subverted the favourite Platonic dogma,
that as dead men are made out of living ones, so living men
are made out of dead ones; and he exploded the idea which
Virgil seems to have adopted from Plato, that the purified
souls which have been sent into the Elysian fields (the poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
name for the joys of the blessed) are summoned to the river
Lethe, that is, to the oblivion of the past,</p>

<p>This found no favour with Porphyry, and very justly; for it
is indeed foolish to believe that souls should desire to return
from that life, which cannot be very blessed unless by the
assurance of its permanence, and to come back into this life,
and to the pollution of corruptible bodies, as if the result of
perfect purification were only to make defilement desirable.
For if perfect purification effects the oblivion of all evils, and
the oblivion of evils creates a desire for a body in which the
soul may again be entangled with evils, then the supreme
felicity will be the cause of infelicity, and the perfection of
wisdom the cause of foolishness, and the purest cleansing the
cause of defilement. And, however long the blessedness of
the soul last, it cannot be founded on truth, if, in order to be
blessed, it must be deceived. For it cannot be blessed unless
it be free from fear. But, to be free from fear, it must be
under the <i>false</i> impression that it shall be always blessed,&mdash;the
false impression, for it is destined to be also at some time
miserable. How, then, shall the soul rejoice in truth, whose
joy is founded on falsehood? Porphyry saw this, and therefore
said that the purified soul returns to the Father, that it
may never more be entangled in the polluting contact with
evil. The opinion, therefore, of some Platonists, that there is
a necessary revolution carrying souls away and bringing them
round again to the same things, is false. But, were it true,
what were the advantage of knowing it? Would the Platonists
presume to allege their superiority to us, because we
were in this life ignorant of what they themselves were doomed
to be ignorant of when perfected in purity and wisdom in
another and better life, and which they must be ignorant of
if they are to be blessed? If it were most absurd and foolish
to say so, then certainly we must prefer Porphyry's opinion
to the idea of a circulation of souls through constantly alternating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
happiness and misery. And if this is just, here is a
Platonist emending Plato, here is a man who saw what Plato
did not see, and who did not shrink from correcting so illustrious
a master, but preferred truth to Plato.</p>


<p class="center">31. <i>Against the arguments on which the Platonists ground their assertion that
the human soul is co-eternal with God.</i></p>

<p>Why, then, do we not rather believe the divinity in those
matters, which human talent cannot fathom? Why do we
not credit the assertion of divinity, that the soul is not co-eternal
with God, but is created, and once was not? For the
Platonists seemed to themselves to allege an adequate reason
for their rejection of this doctrine, when they affirmed that
nothing could be everlasting which had not always existed.
Plato, however, in writing concerning the world and the gods
in it, whom the Supreme made, most expressly states that
they had a beginning and yet would have no end, but, by the
sovereign will of the Creator, would endure eternally. But,
by way of interpreting this, the Platonists have discovered
that he meant a beginning, not of time, but of cause. "For
as if a foot," they say, "had been always from eternity in
dust, there would always have been a print underneath it;
and yet no one would doubt that this print was made by the
pressure of the foot, nor that, though the one was made by
the other, neither was prior to the other; so," they say, "the
world and the gods created in it have always been, their
Creator always existing, and yet they were made." If, then,
the soul has always existed, are we to say that its wretchedness
has always existed? For if there is something in it
which was not from eternity, but began in time, why is it
impossible that the soul itself, though not previously existing,
should begin to be in time? Its blessedness, too, which, as
he owns, is to be more stable, and indeed endless, after the
soul's experience of evils,&mdash;this undoubtedly has a beginning
in time, and yet is to be always, though previously it had no
existence. This whole argumentation, therefore, to establish
that nothing can be endless except that which has had no
beginning, falls to the ground. For here we find the blessedness
of the soul, which has a beginning, and yet has no end.
And, therefore, let the incapacity of man give place to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
authority of God; and let us take our belief regarding the
true religion from the ever-blessed spirits, who do not seek for
themselves that honour which they know to be due to their
God and ours, and who do not command us to sacrifice save
only to Him, whose sacrifice, as I have often said already,
and must often say again, we and they ought together to be,
offered through that Priest who offered Himself to death a
sacrifice for us, in that human nature which He assumed, and
according to which He desired to be our Priest.</p>

<p>32. <i>Of the universal way of the soul's deliverance, which Porphyry did not find
because he did not rightly seek it, and which the grace of Christ has alone
thrown open.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This is the religion which possesses the universal way for
delivering the soul; for, except by this way, none can be
delivered. This is a kind of royal way, which alone leads to
a kingdom which does not totter like all temporal dignities,
but stands firm on eternal foundations. And when Porphyry
says, towards the end of the first book <i>De Regressu Animæ</i>,
that no system of doctrine which furnishes the universal way
for delivering the soul has as yet been received, either from
the truest philosophy, or from the ideas and practices of the
Indians, or from the reasoning<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> of the Chaldæans, or from any
source whatever, and that no historical reading had made
him acquainted with that way, he manifestly acknowledges
that there is such a way, but that as yet he was not acquainted
with it. Nothing of all that he had so laboriously learned
concerning the deliverance of the soul, nothing of all that he
seemed to others, if not to himself, to know and believe, satisfied
him. For he perceived that there was still wanting a
commanding authority which it might be right to follow in a
matter of such importance. And when he says that he had
not learned from any truest philosophy a system which possessed
the universal way of the soul's deliverance, he shows
plainly enough, as it seems to me, either that the philosophy
of which he was a disciple was not the truest, or that it did
not comprehend such a way. And how can that be the truest
philosophy which does not possess this way? For what else
is the universal way of the soul's deliverance than that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
which all souls universally are delivered, and without which,
therefore, no soul is delivered? And when he says, in addition,
"or from the ideas and practices of the Indians, or from
the reasoning of the Chaldæans, or from any source whatever,"
he declares in the most unequivocal language that this universal
way of the soul's deliverance was not embraced in what
he had learned either from the Indians or the Chaldæans; and
yet he could not forbear stating that it was from the Chaldæans
he had derived these divine oracles of which he makes such
frequent mention. What, therefore, does he mean by this
universal way of the soul's deliverance, which had not yet
been made known by any truest philosophy, or by the doctrinal
systems of those nations which were considered to have
great insight in things divine, because they indulged more
freely in a curious and fanciful science and worship of angels?
What is this universal way of which he acknowledges his
ignorance, if not a way which does not belong to one nation
as its special property, but is common to all, and divinely
bestowed? Porphyry, a man of no mediocre abilities, does
not question that such a way exists; for he believes that
Divine Providence could not have left men destitute of this
universal way of delivering the soul. For he does not say
that this way does not exist, but that this great boon and
assistance has not yet been discovered, and has not come to
his knowledge. And no wonder; for Porphyry lived in an age
when this universal way of the soul's deliverance,&mdash;in other
words, the Christian religion,&mdash;was exposed to the persecutions
of idolaters and demon-worshippers, and earthly rulers,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> that
the number of martyrs or witnesses for the truth might be
completed and consecrated, and that by them proof might be
given that we must endure all bodily sufferings in the cause
of the holy faith, and for the commendation of the truth.
Porphyry, being a witness of these persecutions, concluded
that this way was destined to a speedy extinction, and that it,
therefore, was not the universal way of the soul's deliverance,
and did not see that the very thing that thus moved him, and
deterred him from becoming a Christian, contributed to the
confirmation and more effectual commendation of our religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, is the universal way of the soul's deliverance,
the way that is granted by the divine compassion to the
nations universally. And no nation to which the knowledge
of it has already come, or may hereafter come, ought to
demand, Why so soon? or, Why so late?&mdash;for the design of
Him who sends it is impenetrable by human capacity. This
was felt by Porphyry when he confined himself to saying that
this gift of God was not yet received, and had not yet come
to his knowledge. For, though this was so, he did not on
that account pronounce that the way itself had no existence.
This, I say, is the universal way for the deliverance
of believers, concerning which the faithful Abraham received
the divine assurance, "In thy seed shall all nations be
blessed."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> He, indeed, was by birth a Chaldæan; but, that
he might receive these great promises, and that there might
be propagated from him a seed "disposed by angels in the
hand of a Mediator,"<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> in whom this universal way, thrown
open to all nations for the deliverance of the soul, might be
found, he was ordered to leave his country, and kindred, and
father's house. Then was he himself, first of all, delivered
from the Chaldæan superstitions, and by his obedience worshipped
the one true God, whose promises he faithfully
trusted. This is the universal way, of which it is said in
holy prophecy, "God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and
cause His face to shine upon us; that Thy way may be
known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
And hence, when our Saviour, so long after, had taken flesh
of the seed of Abraham, He says of Himself, "I am the way,
the truth, and the life."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> This is the universal way, of which
so long before it had been predicted, "And it shall come to
pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house
shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go
up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of
Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk
in His paths: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
word of the Lord from Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> This way, therefore, is not
the property of one, but of all nations. The law and the word
of the Lord did not remain in Zion and Jerusalem, but issued
thence to be universally diffused. And therefore the Mediator
Himself, after His resurrection, says to His alarmed disciples,
"These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet
with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written
in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms,
concerning me. Then opened He their understandings that
they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them,
Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and
to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in His name among all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> This is the universal way
of the soul's deliverance, which the holy angels and the holy
prophets formerly disclosed where they could among the few
men who found the grace of God, and especially in the Hebrew
nation, whose commonwealth was, as it were, consecrated to
prefigure and fore-announce the city of God which was to be
gathered from all nations, by their tabernacle, and temple, and
priesthood, and sacrifices. In some explicit statements, and
in many obscure foreshadowings, this way was declared; but
latterly came the Mediator Himself in the flesh, and His
blessed apostles, revealing how the grace of the New Testament
more openly explained what had been obscurely hinted
to preceding generations, in conformity with the relation of
the ages of the human race, and as it pleased God in His
wisdom to appoint, who also bore them witness with signs
and miracles, some of which I have cited above. For not
only were there visions of angels, and words heard from those
heavenly ministrants, but also men of God, armed with the
word of simple piety, cast out unclean spirits from the bodies
and senses of men, and healed deformities and sicknesses;
the wild beasts of earth and sea, the birds of air, inanimate
things, the elements, the stars, obeyed their divine commands;
the powers of hell gave way before them, the dead were restored
to life. I say nothing of the miracles peculiar and
proper to the Saviour's own person, especially the nativity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
and the resurrection; in the one of which He wrought only
the mystery of a virgin maternity, while in the other He
furnished an instance of the resurrection which all shall at
last experience. This way purifies the whole man, and prepares
the mortal in all his parts for immortality. For, to
prevent us from seeking for one purgation for the part which
Porphyry calls intellectual, and another for the part he calls
spiritual, and another for the body itself, our most mighty
and truthful Purifier and Saviour assumed the whole human
nature. Except by this way, which has been present among
men both during the period of the promises and of the proclamation
of their fulfilment, no man has been delivered, no
man is delivered, no man shall be delivered.</p>

<p>As to Porphyry's statement that the universal way of the
soul's deliverance had not yet come to his knowledge by any
acquaintance he had with history, I would ask, what more
remarkable history can be found than that which has taken
possession of the whole world by its authoritative voice? or
what more trustworthy than that which narrates past events,
and predicts the future with equal clearness, and in the unfulfilled
predictions of which we are constrained to believe by
those that are already fulfilled? For neither Porphyry nor
any Platonists can despise divination and prediction, even of
things that pertain to this life and earthly matters, though
they justly despise ordinary soothsaying and the divination
that is connected with magical arts. They deny that these
are the predictions of great men, or are to be considered
important, and they are right; for they are founded, either
on the foresight of subsidiary causes, as to a professional eye
much of the course of a disease is foreseen by certain premonitory
symptoms, or the unclean demons predict what
they have resolved to do, that they may thus work upon the
thoughts and desires of the wicked with an appearance of
authority, and incline human frailty to imitate their impure
actions. It is not such things that the saints who walk in
the universal way care to predict as important, although, for
the purpose of commending the faith, they knew and often
predicted even such things as could not be detected by human
observation, nor be readily verified by experience. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
were other truly important and divine events which they predicted,
in so far as it was given them to know the will of
God. For the incarnation of Christ, and all those important
marvels that were accomplished in Him, and done in His
name; the repentance of men and the conversion of their wills
to God; the remission of sins, the grace of righteousness, the
faith of the pious, and the multitudes in all parts of the world
who believe in the true divinity; the overthrow of idolatry
and demon worship, and the testing of the faithful by trials;
the purification of those who persevered, and their deliverance
from all evil; the day of judgment, the resurrection of the
dead, the eternal damnation of the community of the ungodly,
and the eternal kingdom of the most glorious city of God,
ever-blessed in the enjoyment of the vision of God,&mdash;these
things were predicted and promised in the Scriptures of this
way; and of these we see so many fulfilled, that we justly
and piously trust that the rest will also come to pass. As
for those who do not believe, and consequently do not understand,
that this is the way which leads straight to the vision
of God and to eternal fellowship with Him, according to the
true predictions and statements of the Holy Scriptures, they
may storm at our position, but they cannot storm it.</p>

<p>And therefore, in these ten books, though not meeting, I
dare say, the expectation of some, yet I have, as the true God
and Lord has vouchsafed to aid me, satisfied the desire of
certain persons, by refuting the objections of the ungodly,
who prefer their own gods to the Founder of the holy city,
about which we undertook to speak. Of these ten books, the
first five were directed against those who think we should
worship the gods for the sake of the blessings of this life, and
the second five against those who think we should worship
them for the sake of the life which is to be after death. And
now, in fulfilment of the promise I made in the first book, I
shall go on to say, as God shall aid me, what I think needs
to be said regarding the origin, history, and deserved ends of
the two cities, which, as already remarked, are in this world
commingled and implicated with one another.</p>

THE TWO CITIES WERE FORMED ORIGINALLY, BY THE SEPARATION OF THE
GOOD AND BAD ANGELS; AND TAKES OCCASION TO TREAT OF THE CREATION
OF THE WORLD, AS IT IS DESCRIBED IN HOLY SCRIPTURE IN THE BEGINNING
OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of this part of the work, wherein we begin to explain the origin and end
of the two cities.</i></p>

<p>The city of God we speak of is the same to which testimony
is borne by that Scripture, which excels all the
writings of all nations by its divine authority, and has brought
under its influence all kinds of minds, and this not by a
casual intellectual movement, but obviously by an express
providential arrangement. For there it is written, "Glorious
things are spoken of thee, O city of God."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> And in another
psalm we read, "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in
the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness, increasing
the joy of the whole earth."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> And, a little after, in the
same psalm, "As we have heard, so have we seen in the city
of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God has established
it for ever." And in another, "There is a river the
streams whereof shall make glad the city of our God, the holy
place of the tabernacles of the Most High. God is in the
midst of her, she shall not be moved."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> From these and
similar testimonies, all of which it were tedious to cite, we
have learned that there is a city of God, and its Founder has
inspired us with a love which makes us covet its citizenship.
To this Founder of the holy city the citizens of the earthly
city prefer their own gods, not knowing that He is the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
of gods, not of false, <i>i.e.</i> of impious and proud gods, who,
being deprived of His unchangeable and freely communicated
light, and so reduced to a kind of poverty-stricken power,
eagerly grasp at their own private privileges, and seek divine
honours from their deluded subjects; but of the pious and
holy gods, who are better pleased to submit themselves to one,
than to subject many to themselves, and who would rather
worship God than be worshipped as God. But to the enemies
of this city we have replied in the ten preceding books, according
to our ability and the help afforded by our Lord
and King. Now, recognising what is expected of me, and
not unmindful of my promise, and relying, too, on the same
succour, I will endeavour to treat of the origin, and progress,
and deserved destinies of the two cities (the earthly and the
heavenly, to wit), which, as we said, are in this present world
commingled, and as it were entangled together. And, first, I
will explain how the foundations of these two cities were
originally laid, in the difference that arose among the angels.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the knowledge of God, to which no man can attain save through the
Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</i></p>

<p>It is a great and very rare thing for a man, after he has
contemplated the whole creation, corporeal and incorporeal,
and has discerned its mutability, to pass beyond it, and, by
the continued soaring of his mind, to attain to the unchangeable
substance of God, and, in that height of contemplation, to
learn from God Himself that none but He has made all that
is not of the divine essence. For God speaks with a man
not by means of some audible creature dinning in his ears, so
that atmospheric vibrations connect Him that makes with
him that hears the sound, nor even by means of a spiritual
being with the semblance of a body, such as we see in dreams
or similar states; for even in this case He speaks as if to the
ears of the body, because it is by means of the semblance of
a body He speaks, and with the appearance of a real interval of
space,&mdash;for visions are exact representations of bodily objects.
Not by these, then, does God speak, but by the truth itself,
if any one is prepared to hear with the mind rather than with
the body. For He speaks to that part of man which is better
than all else that is in him, and than which God Himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
alone is better. For since man is most properly understood
(or, if that cannot be, then, at least, <i>believed</i>) to be made in
God's image, no doubt it is that part of him by which he
rises above those lower parts he has in common with the
beasts, which brings him nearer to the Supreme. But since
the mind itself, though naturally capable of reason and intelligence,
is disabled by besotting and inveterate vices not
merely from delighting and abiding in, but even from tolerating
His unchangeable light, until it has been gradually healed,
and renewed, and made capable of such felicity, it had, in
the first place, to be impregnated with faith, and so purified.
And that in this faith it might advance the more confidently
towards the truth, the truth itself, God, God's Son, assuming
humanity without destroying His divinity,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> established and
founded this faith, that there might be a way for man to
man's God through a God-man. For this is the Mediator
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. For it is as
man that He is the Mediator and the Way. Since, if the
way lieth between him who goes, and the place whither he
goes, there is hope of his reaching it; but if there be no way,
or if he know not where it is, what boots it to know whither
he should go? Now the only way that is infallibly secured
against all mistakes, is when the very same person is at once
God and man, God our end, man our way.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Of the authority of the canonical Scriptures composed by the Divine Spirit.</i></p>

<p>This Mediator, having spoken what He judged sufficient,
first by the prophets, then by His own lips, and afterwards by
the apostles, has besides produced the Scripture which is called
canonical, which has paramount authority, and to which we
yield assent in all matters of which we ought not to be
ignorant, and yet cannot know of ourselves. For if we attain
the knowledge of present objects by the testimony of our own
senses,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> whether internal or external, then, regarding objects
remote from our own senses, we need others to bring their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
testimony, since we cannot know them by our own, and we
credit the persons to whom the objects have been or are
sensibly present. Accordingly, as in the case of visible objects
which we have not seen, we trust those who have, (and likewise
with all sensible objects,) so in the case of things which
are perceived<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> by the mind and spirit, <i>i.e.</i> which are remote
from our own interior sense, it behoves us to trust those who
have seen them set in that incorporeal light, or abidingly
contemplate them.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>That the world is neither without beginning, nor yet created by a new decree
of God, by which He afterwards willed what He had not before willed.</i></p>

<p>Of all visible things, the world is the greatest; of all invisible,
the greatest is God. But, that the world is, we see;
that God is, we believe. That God made the world, we can
believe from no one more safely than from God Himself. But
where have we heard Him? Nowhere more distinctly than in
the Holy Scriptures, where His prophet said, "In the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth."<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Was the prophet
present when God made the heavens and the earth? No;
but the wisdom of God, by whom all things were made, was
there,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and wisdom insinuates itself into holy souls, and makes
them the friends of God and His prophets, and noiselessly
informs them of His works. They are taught also by the
angels of God, who always behold the face of the Father,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and
announce His will to whom it befits. Of these prophets was
he who said and wrote, "In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth." And so fit a witness was he of God,
that the same Spirit of God, who revealed these things to him,
enabled him also so long before to predict that our faith also
would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>But why did God choose then to create the heavens and
earth which up to that time He had not made?<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> If they
who put this question wish to make out that the world is
eternal and without beginning, and that consequently it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
not been made by God, they are strangely deceived, and rave
in the incurable madness of impiety. For, though the voices of
the prophets were silent, the world itself, by its well-ordered
changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of all
visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has
been created, and also that it could not have been created save
by God, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible.
As for those<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> who own, indeed, that it was made by
God, and yet ascribe to it not a temporal but only a creational
beginning, so that in some scarcely intelligible way the world
should always have existed a created world, they make an
assertion which seems to them to defend God from the charge
of arbitrary hastiness, or of suddenly conceiving the idea of
creating the world as a quite new idea, or of casually changing
His will, though He be unchangeable. But I do not see
how this supposition of theirs can stand in other respects, and
chiefly in respect of the soul; for if they contend that it is
co-eternal with God, they will be quite at a loss to explain
whence there has accrued to it new misery, which through a
previous eternity had not existed. For if they said that its
happiness and misery ceaselessly alternate, they must say,
further, that this alternation will continue for ever; whence
will result this absurdity, that, though the soul is called
blessed, it is not so in this, that it foresees its own misery and
disgrace. And yet, if it does not foresee it, and supposes that
it will be neither disgraced nor wretched, but always blessed,
then it is blessed because it is deceived; and a more foolish
statement one cannot make. But if their idea is that the
soul's misery has alternated with its bliss during the ages of
the past eternity, but that now, when once the soul has been
set free, it will return henceforth no more to misery, they are
nevertheless of opinion that it has never been truly blessed
before, but begins at last to enjoy a new and uncertain happiness;
that is to say, they must acknowledge that some new
thing, and that an important and signal thing, happens to the
soul which never in a whole past eternity happened it before.
And if they deny that God's eternal purpose included this
new experience of the soul, they deny that He is the Author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
of its blessedness, which is unspeakable impiety. If, on the
other hand, they say that the future blessedness of the soul is
the result of a new decree of God, how will they show that
God is not chargeable with that mutability which displeases
them? Further, if they acknowledge that it was created in
time, but will never perish in time,&mdash;that it has, like number,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
a beginning but no end,&mdash;and that, therefore, having once made
trial of misery, and been delivered from it, it will never again
return thereto, they will certainly admit that this takes place
without any violation of the immutable counsel of God. Let
them, then, in like manner believe regarding the world that it
too could be made in time, and yet that God, in making it,
did not alter His eternal design.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap5"></a>5. <i>That we ought not to seek to comprehend the infinite ages of time before
the world, nor the infinite realms of space.</i></p>

<p>Next, we must see what reply can be made to those who
agree that God is the Creator of the world, but have difficulties
about the time of its creation, and what reply, also, they can
make to difficulties we might raise about the place of its
creation. For, as they demand why the world was created
then and no sooner, we may ask why it was created just here
where it is, and not elsewhere. For if they imagine infinite
spaces of time before the world, during which God could not
have been idle, in like manner they may conceive outside the
world infinite realms of space, in which, if any one says that
the Omnipotent cannot hold His hand from working, will it
not follow that they must adopt Epicurus' dream of innumerable
worlds? with this difference only, that he asserts that
they are formed and destroyed by the fortuitous movements
of atoms, while they will hold that they are made by God's
hand, if they maintain that, throughout the boundless immensity
of space, stretching interminably in every direction round the
world, God cannot rest, and that the worlds which they suppose
Him to make cannot be destroyed. For here the question
is with those who, with ourselves, believe that God is spiritual,
and the Creator of all existences but Himself. As for others,
it is a condescension to dispute with them on a religious
question, for they have acquired a reputation only among men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
who pay divine honours to a number of gods, and have
become conspicuous among the other philosophers for no other
reason than that, though they are still far from the truth,
they are near it in comparison with the rest. While these,
then, neither confine in any place, nor limit, nor distribute the
divine substance, but, as is worthy of God, own it to be wholly
though spiritually present everywhere, will they perchance say
that this substance is absent from such immense spaces outside
the world, and is occupied in one only, (and that a very little
one compared with the infinity beyond,) the one, namely, in
which is the world? I think they will not proceed to this
absurdity. Since they maintain that there is but one world,
of vast material bulk, indeed, yet finite, and in its own determinate
position, and that this was made by the working of
God, let them give the same account of God's resting in the
infinite times before the world as they give of His resting in
the infinite spaces outside of it. And as it does not follow
that God set the world in the very spot it occupies and no
other by accident rather than by divine reason, although no
human reason can comprehend why it was so set, and though
there was no merit in the spot chosen to give it the precedence
of infinite others, so neither does it follow that we should
suppose that God was guided by chance when He created the
world in that and no earlier time, although previous times
had been running by during an infinite past, and though there
was no difference by which one time could be chosen in preference
to another. But if they say that the thoughts of
men are idle when they conceive infinite places, since there
is no place beside the world, we reply that, by the same
showing, it is vain to conceive of the past times of God's rest,
since there is no time before the world.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That the world and time had both one beginning, and the one did not
anticipate the other.</i></p>

<p>For if eternity and time are rightly distinguished by this,
that time does not exist without some movement and transition,
while in eternity there is no change, who does not see that
there could have been no time had not some creature been
made, which by some motion could give birth to change,&mdash;the
various parts of which motion and change, as they cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
simultaneous, succeed one another,&mdash;and thus, in these shorter
or longer intervals of duration, time would begin? Since
then, God, in whose eternity is no change at all, is the Creator
and Ordainer of time, I do not see how He can be said to
have created the world after spaces of time had elapsed, unless
it be said that prior to the world there was some creature by
whose movement time could pass. And if the sacred and
infallible Scriptures say that in the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth, in order that it may be understood
that He had made nothing previously,&mdash;for if He had made
anything before the rest, this thing would rather be said to
have been made "in the beginning,"&mdash;then assuredly the
world was made, not in time, but simultaneously with time.
For that which is made in time is made both after and before
some time,&mdash;after that which is past, before that which is
future. But none could then be past, for there was no creature
by whose movements its duration could be measured.
But simultaneously with time the world was made, if in the
world's creation change and motion were created, as seems
evident from the order of the first six or seven days. For in
these days the morning and evening are counted, until, on the
sixth day, all things which God then made were finished, and
on the seventh the rest of God was mysteriously and sublimely
signalized. What kind of days these were it is extremely
difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive, and how
much more to say!</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap7"></a>7. <i>Of the nature of the first days, which are said to have had morning
and evening, before there was a sun.</i></p>

<p>We see, indeed, that our ordinary days have no evening but
by the setting, and no morning but by the rising, of the sun;
but the first three days of all were passed without sun, since
it is reported to have been made on the fourth day. And first
of all, indeed, light was made by the word of God, and God,
we read, separated it from the darkness, and called the light
Day, and the darkness Night; but what kind of light that was,
and by what periodic movement it made evening and morning,
is beyond the reach of our senses; neither can we understand
how it was, and yet must unhesitatingly believe it. For either
it was some material light, whether proceeding from the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
parts of the world, far removed from our sight, or from the
spot where the sun was afterwards kindled; or under the
name of light the holy city was signified, composed of holy
angels and blessed spirits, the city of which the apostle says,
"Jerusalem which is above is our eternal mother in heaven;"<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
and in another place, "For ye are all the children of the light,
and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of
darkness."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Yet in some respects we may appropriately speak
of a morning and evening of this day also. For the knowledge
of the creature is, in comparison of the knowledge of the
Creator, but a twilight; and so it dawns and breaks into
morning when the creature is drawn to the praise and love
of the Creator; and night never falls when the Creator is not
forsaken through love of the creature. In fine, Scripture,
when it would recount those days in order, never mentions
the word night. It never says, "Night was," but "The evening
and the morning were the first day." So of the second and
the rest. And, indeed, the knowledge of created things contemplated
by themselves is, so to speak, more colourless than
when they are seen in the wisdom of God, as in the art by
which they were made. Therefore evening is a more suitable
figure than night; and yet, as I said, morning returns when
the creature returns to the praise and love of the Creator.
When it does so in the knowledge of itself, that is the first
day; when in the knowledge of the firmament, which is the
name given to the sky between the waters above and those
beneath, that is the second day; when in the knowledge of
the earth, and the sea, and all things that grow out of the
earth, that is the third day; when in the knowledge of the
greater and less luminaries, and all the stars, that is the fourth
day; when in the knowledge of all animals that swim in the
waters and that fly in the air, that is the fifth day; when in
the knowledge of all animals that live on the earth, and of
man himself, that is the sixth day.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap118"></a>8. <i>What we are to understand of God's resting on the seventh day, after
the six days' work.</i></p>

<p>When it is said that God rested on the seventh day from
all His works, and hallowed it, we are not to conceive of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
in a childish fashion, as if work were a toil to God, who "spake
and it was done,"&mdash;spake by the spiritual and eternal, not
audible and transitory word. But God's rest signifies the
rest of those who rest in God, as the joy of a house means
the joy of those in the house who rejoice, though not the
house, but something else, causes the joy. How much more
intelligible is such phraseology, then, if the house itself, by its
own beauty, makes the inhabitants joyful! For in this case
we not only call it joyful by that figure of speech in which
the thing containing is used for the thing contained (as when
we say, "The theatres applaud," "The meadows low," meaning
that the men in the one applaud, and the oxen in the other
low), but also by that figure in which the cause is spoken of
as if it were the effect, as when a letter is said to be joyful,
because it makes its readers so. Most appropriately, therefore,
the sacred narrative states that God rested, meaning thereby
that those rest who are in Him, and whom He makes to rest.
And this the prophetic narrative promises also to the men to
whom it speaks, and for whom it was written, that they themselves,
after those good works which God does in and by
them, if they have managed by faith to get near to God in
this life, shall enjoy in Him eternal rest. This was prefigured
to the ancient people of God by the rest enjoined in
their sabbath law, of which, in its own place, I shall speak
more at large.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>What the Scriptures teach us to believe concerning the creation of
the angels.</i></p>

<p>At present, since I have undertaken to treat of the origin
of the holy city, and first of the holy angels, who constitute
a large part of this city, and indeed the more blessed part,
since they have never been expatriated, I will give myself to
the task of explaining, by God's help, and as far as seems
suitable, the Scriptures which relate to this point. Where
Scripture speaks of the world's creation, it is not plainly said
whether or when the angels were created; but if mention of
them is made, it is implicitly under the name of "heaven,"
when it is said, "In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth," or perhaps rather under the name of "light,"
of which presently. But that they were wholly omitted, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
am unable to believe, because it is written that God on the
seventh day rested from all His works which He made; and
this very book itself begins, "In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth," so that before heaven and earth
God seems to have made nothing. Since, therefore, He began
with the heavens and the earth,&mdash;and the earth itself, as Scripture
adds, was at first invisible and formless, light not being
as yet made, and darkness covering the face of the deep (that
is to say, covering an undefined chaos of earth and sea, for
where light is not, darkness must needs be),&mdash;and then when
all things, which are recorded to have been completed in six
days, were created and arranged, how should the angels be
omitted, as if they were not among the works of God, from
which on the seventh day He rested? Yet, though the fact
that the angels are the work of God is not omitted here, it is
indeed not explicitly mentioned; but elsewhere Holy Scripture
asserts it in the clearest manner. For in the Hymn of
the Three Children in the Furnace it was said, "O all ye works
of the Lord, bless ye the Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and among these works
mentioned afterwards in detail, the angels are named. And
in the psalm it is said, "Praise ye the Lord from the heavens,
praise Him in the heights. Praise ye Him, all His angels;
praise ye Him, all His hosts. Praise ye Him, sun and moon;
praise Him, all ye stars of light. Praise Him, ye heaven of
heavens; and ye waters that be above the heavens. Let them
praise the name of the Lord; for He commanded, and they
were created."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Here the angels are most expressly and by
divine authority said to have been made by God, for of them
among the other heavenly things it is said, "He commanded,
and they were created." Who, then, will be bold enough to
suggest that the angels were made after the six days' creation?
If any one is so foolish, his folly is disposed of by a scripture
of like authority, where God says, "When the stars were
made, the angels praised me with a loud voice."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The angels
therefore existed before the stars; and the stars were made
the fourth day. Shall we then say that they were made the
third day? Far from it; for we know what was made
that day. The earth was separated from the water, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
element took its own distinct form, and the earth produced all
that grows on it. On the second day, then? Not even on
this; for on it the firmament was made between the waters
above and beneath, and was called "Heaven," in which firmament
the stars were made on the fourth day. There is no
question, then, that if the angels are included in the works of
God during these six days, they are that light which was
called "Day," and whose unity Scripture signalizes by calling
that day not the "first day," but "one day."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> For the second
day, the third, and the rest are not other days; but the same
"one" day is repeated to complete the number six or seven,
so that there should be knowledge both of God's works and
of His rest. For when God said, "Let there be light, and
there was light," if we are justified in understanding in this
light the creation of the angels, then certainly they were
created partakers of the eternal light which is the unchangeable
Wisdom of God, by which all things were made, and
whom we call the only-begotten Son of God; so that they,
being illumined by the Light that created them, might themselves
become light and be called "Day," in participation of
that unchangeable Light and Day which is the Word of God,
by whom both themselves and all else were made. "The true
Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,"<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>&mdash;this
Light lighteth also every pure angel, that he may be
light not in himself, but in God; from whom if an angel
turn away, he becomes impure, as are all those who are called
unclean spirits, and are no longer light in the Lord, but darkness
in themselves, being deprived of the participation of Light
eternal. For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good
has received the name "evil."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the simple and unchangeable Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one
God, in whom substance and quality are identical.</i></p>

<p>There is, accordingly, a good which is alone simple, and
therefore alone unchangeable, and this is God. By this Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
have all others been created, but not simple, and therefore not
unchangeable. "Created," I say,&mdash;that is, made, not begotten.
For that which is begotten of the simple Good is simple as
itself, and the same as itself. These two we call the Father
and the Son; and both together with the Holy Spirit are one
God; and to this Spirit the epithet Holy is in Scripture, as it
were, appropriated. And He is another than the Father and
the Son, for He is neither the Father nor the Son. I say
"another," not "another thing," because He is equally with
them the simple Good, unchangeable and co-eternal. And
this Trinity is one God; and none the less simple because a
Trinity. For we do not say that the nature of the good is
simple, because the Father alone possesses it, or the Son alone,
or the Holy Ghost alone; nor do we say, with the Sabellian
heretics, that it is only nominally a Trinity, and has no real
distinction of persons; but we say it is simple, because it is
what it has, with the exception of the relation of the persons
to one another. For, in regard to this relation, it is true that
the Father has a Son, and yet is not Himself the Son; and
the Son has a Father, and is not Himself the Father. But,
as regards Himself, irrespective of relation to the other, each
is what He has; thus, He is in Himself living, for He has
life, and is Himself the Life which He has.</p>

<p>It is for this reason, then, that the nature of the Trinity is
called simple, because it has not anything which it can lose,
and because it is not one thing and its contents another, as a
cup and the liquor, or a body and its colour, or the air and
the light or heat of it, or a mind and its wisdom. For none
of these is what it has: the cup is not liquor, nor the body
colour, nor the air light and heat, nor the mind wisdom. And
hence they can be deprived of what they have, and can be
turned or changed into other qualities and states, so that the
cup may be emptied of the liquid of which it is full, the body
be discoloured, the air darken, the mind grow silly. The incorruptible
body which is promised to the saints in the resurrection
cannot, indeed, lose its quality of incorruption, but
the bodily substance and the quality of incorruption are not
the same thing. For the quality of incorruption resides
entire in each several part, not greater in one and less in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
another; for no part is more incorruptible than another. The
body, indeed, is itself greater in whole than in part; and one
part of it is larger, another smaller, yet is not the larger more
incorruptible than the smaller. The body, then, which is not
in each of its parts a whole body, is one thing; incorruptibility,
which is throughout complete, is another thing;&mdash;for
every part of the incorruptible body, however unequal to the
rest otherwise, is equally incorrupt. For the hand, <i>e.g.</i>, is
not more incorrupt than the finger because it is larger than
the finger; so, though finger and hand are unequal, their incorruptibility
is equal. Thus, although incorruptibility is
inseparable from an incorruptible body, yet the substance of
the body is one thing, the quality of incorruption another.
And therefore the body is not what it has. The soul itself,
too, though it be always wise (as it will be eternally when it
is redeemed), will be so by participating in the unchangeable
wisdom, which it is not; for though the air be never robbed
of the light that is shed abroad in it, it is not on that account
the same thing as the light. I do not mean that the soul is
air, as has been supposed by some who could not conceive a
spiritual nature;<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> but, with much dissimilarity, the two things
have a kind of likeness, which makes it suitable to say that
the immaterial soul is illumined with the immaterial light of
the simple wisdom of God, as the material air is irradiated
with material light, and that, as the air, when deprived of
this light, grows dark, (for material darkness is nothing else
than air wanting light,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>) so the soul, deprived of the light of
wisdom, grows dark.</p>

<p>According to this, then, those things which are essentially
and truly divine are called simple, because in them quality
and substance are identical, and because they are divine, or
wise, or blessed in themselves, and without extraneous supplement.
In Holy Scripture, it is true, the Spirit of wisdom is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
called "manifold"<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> because it contains many things in it; but
what it contains it also is, and it being one is all these things.
For neither are there many wisdoms, but one, in which are
untold and infinite treasures of things intellectual, wherein
are all invisible and unchangeable reasons of things visible
and changeable which were created by it.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> For God made
nothing unwittingly; not even a human workman can be said
to do so. But if He knew all that He made, He made only
those things which He had known. Whence flows a very
striking but true conclusion, that this world could not be
known to us unless it existed, but could not have existed
unless it had been known to God.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Whether the angels that fell partook of the blessedness which the holy
angels have always enjoyed from the time of their creation.</i></p>

<p>And since these things are so, those spirits whom we call
angels were never at any time or in any way darkness, but, as
soon as they were made, were made light; yet they were not
so created in order that they might exist and live in any way
whatever, but were enlightened that they might live wisely
and blessedly. Some of them, having turned away from this
light, have not won this wise and blessed life, which is certainly
eternal, and accompanied with the sure confidence of its
eternity; but they have still the life of reason, though darkened
with folly, and this they cannot lose, even if they would.
But who can determine to what extent they were partakers
of that wisdom before they fell? And how shall we say that
they participated in it equally with those who through it are
truly and fully blessed, resting in a true certainty of eternal
felicity? For if they had equally participated in this true
knowledge, then the evil angels would have remained eternally
blessed equally with the good, because they were equally expectant
of it. For, though a life be never so long, it cannot
be truly called eternal if it is destined to have an end; for
it is called life inasmuch as it is lived, but eternal because it
has no end. Wherefore, although everything eternal is not
therefore blessed (for hell-fire is eternal), yet if no life can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
truly and perfectly blessed except it be eternal, the life of
these angels was not blessed, for it was doomed to end, and
therefore not eternal, whether they knew it or not. In the
one case fear, in the other ignorance, prevented them from
being blessed. And even if their ignorance was not so great
as to breed in them a wholly false expectation, but left them
wavering in uncertainty whether their good would be eternal
or would some time terminate, this very doubt concerning so
grand a destiny was incompatible with the plenitude of
blessedness which we believe the holy angels enjoyed. For
we do not so narrow and restrict the application of the term
"blessedness" as to apply it to God only,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> though doubtless
He is so truly blessed that greater blessedness cannot be; and,
in comparison of His blessedness, what is that of the angels,
though, according to their capacity, they be perfectly blessed?</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>A comparison of the blessedness of the righteous, who have not yet received the
divine reward, with that of our first parents in paradise.</i></p>

<p>And the angels are not the only members of the rational
and intellectual creation whom we call blessed. For who
will take upon him to deny that those first men in Paradise
were blessed previously to sin, although they were uncertain
how long their blessedness was to last, and whether it would
be eternal (and eternal it would have been had they not
sinned),&mdash;who, I say, will do so, seeing that even now we not
unbecomingly call those blessed whom we see leading a
righteous and holy life in hope of immortality, who have no
harrowing remorse of conscience, but obtain readily divine remission
of the sins of their present infirmity? These, though
they are certain that they shall be rewarded if they persevere,
are not certain that they will persevere. For what man can
know that he will persevere to the end in the exercise and
increase of grace, unless he has been certified by some revelation
from Him who, in His just and secret judgment, while
He deceives none, informs few regarding this matter? Accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
so far as present comfort goes, the first man in
Paradise was more blessed than any just man in this insecure
state; but as regards the hope of future good, every man who
not merely supposes, but certainly knows that he shall eternally
enjoy the most high God in the company of angels,
and beyond the reach of ill,&mdash;this man, no matter what bodily
torments afflict him, is more blessed than was he who, even
in that great felicity of Paradise, was uncertain of his fate.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap13"></a>13. <i>Whether all the angels were so created in one common state of felicity, that
those who fell were not aware that they would fall, and that those who
stood received assurance of their own perseverance after the ruin of the
fallen.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>From all this, it will readily occur to any one that the
blessedness which an intelligent being desires as its legitimate
object results from a combination of these two things,
namely, that it uninterruptedly enjoy the unchangeable good,
which is God; and that it be delivered from all dubiety, and
know certainly that it shall eternally abide in the same enjoyment.
That it is so with the angels of light we piously
believe; but that the fallen angels, who by their own default
lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they
sinned, reason bids us conclude. Yet if their life was of any
duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness
of some kind, though not that which is accompanied with
foresight. Or, if it seems hard to believe that, when the angels
were created, some were created in ignorance either of their
perseverance or their fall, while others were most certainly
assured of the eternity of their felicity,&mdash;if it is hard to believe
that they were not all from the beginning on an equal footing,
until these who are now evil did of their own will fall away
from the light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to
believe that the holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal
blessedness, and do not know regarding themselves as much
as we have been able to gather regarding them from the Holy
Scriptures. For what catholic Christian does not know that
no new devil will ever arise among the good angels, as he
knows that this present devil will never again return into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
fellowship of the good? For the truth in the gospel promises
to the saints and the faithful that they will be equal to
the angels of God; and it is also promised them that they
will "go away into life eternal."<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> But if we are certain that
we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are not
certain, then we shall not be their equals, but their superiors.
But as the truth never deceives, and as we shall be their
equals, they must be certain of their blessedness. And because
the evil angels could not be certain of that, since their
blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either
that the angels were unequal, or that, if equal, the good angels
were assured of the eternity of their blessedness after the
perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say
that the words of the Lord about the devil, "He was a
murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,"<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from
the beginning of the human race, when man, whom he could
kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide
in the truth from the time of his own creation, and was
accordingly never blessed with the holy angels, but refused
to submit to his Creator, and proudly exulted as if in a
private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving.
For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be eluded;
and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they
are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things
that does not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John
says thus becomes intelligible: "The devil sinneth from the
beginning,"<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>&mdash;that is, from the time he was created he refused
righteousness which none but a will piously subject to God
can enjoy. Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees
with those heretics the Manichees, and with any other pestilential
sect that may suppose that the devil has derived from
some adverse evil principle a nature proper to himself.
These persons are so befooled by error, that, although they
acknowledge with ourselves the authority of the gospels,
they do not notice that the Lord did not say, "The devil was
naturally a stranger to the truth," but "The devil abode not
in the truth," by which He meant us to understand that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
had fallen from the truth, in which, if he had abode, he would
have become a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness
along with the holy angels.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>


<p class="center">14. <i>An explanation of what is said of the devil, that he did not abide in the
truth, because the truth was not in him.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, as if we had been inquiring why the devil did
not abide in the truth, our Lord subjoins the reason, saying,
"because the truth is not in him." Now, it would be in him
had he abode in it. But the phraseology is unusual. For,
as the words stand, "He abode not in the truth, because the
truth is not in him," it seems as if the truth's not being in
him were the cause of his not abiding in it; whereas his not
abiding in the truth is rather the cause of its not being in
him. The same form of speech is found in the psalm: "I
have called upon Thee, for Thou hast heard me, O God,"<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
where we should expect it to be said, Thou hast heard me,
O God, for I have called upon Thee. But when he had said,
"I have called," then, as if some one were seeking proof of
this, he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of his prayer
by the effect of God's hearing it; as if he had said, The proof
that I have prayed is that Thou hast heard me.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>How we are to understand the words, "The devil sinneth from the
beginning."</i></p>

<p>As for what John says about the devil, "The devil sinneth
from the beginning,"<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> they<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> who suppose it is meant hereby
that the devil was made with a sinful nature, misunderstand
it; for if sin be natural, it is not sin at all. And how do
they answer the prophetic proofs,&mdash;either what Isaiah says
when he represents the devil under the person of the king of
Babylon, "How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!"<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
or what Ezekiel says, "Thou hast been in Eden, the
garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering,"<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
where it is meant that he was some time without sin; for
a little after it is still more explicitly said, "Thou wast
perfect in thy ways?" And if these passages cannot well be
otherwise interpreted, we must understand by this one also,
"He abode not in the truth," that he was once in the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
but did not remain in it. And from this passage, "The devil
sinneth from the beginning," it is not to be supposed that he
sinned from the beginning of his created existence, but from
the beginning of his sin, when by his pride he had once
commenced to sin. There is a passage, too, in the Book of
Job, of which the devil is the subject: "This is the beginning
of the creation of God, which He made to be a sport to His
angels,"<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> which agrees with the psalm, where it is said,
"There is that dragon which Thou hast made to be a sport
therein."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> But these passages are not to lead us to suppose
that the devil was originally created to be the sport of the
angels, but that he was doomed to this punishment after his
sin. His beginning, then, is the handiwork of God; for there
is no nature, even among the least, and lowest, and last of the
beasts, which was not the work of Him from whom has proceeded
all measure, all form, all order, without which nothing
can be planned or conceived. How much more, then, is this
angelic nature, which surpasses in dignity all else that He has
made, the handiwork of the Most High!</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the ranks and differences of the creatures, estimated by their utility, or
according to the natural gradations of being.</i></p>

<p>For, among those beings which exist, and which are not of
God the Creator's essence, those which have life are ranked
above those which have none; those that have the power of
generation, or even of desiring, above those which want this
faculty. And, among things that have life, the sentient are
higher than those which have no sensation, as animals are
ranked above trees. And, among the sentient, the intelligent
are above those that have not intelligence,&mdash;men, <i>e.g.</i>, above
cattle. And, among the intelligent, the immortal, such as the
angels, above the mortal, such as men. These are the gradations
according to the order of nature; but according to the
utility each man finds in a thing, there are various standards
of value, so that it comes to pass that we prefer some things
that have no sensation to some sentient beings. And so strong
is this preference, that, had we the power, we would abolish
the latter from nature altogether, whether in ignorance of the
place they hold in nature, or, though we know it, sacrificing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
them to our own convenience. Who, <i>e.g.</i>, would not rather
have bread in his house than mice, gold than fleas? But
there is little to wonder at in this, seeing that even when
valued by men themselves (whose nature is certainly of the
highest dignity), more is often given for a horse than for a
slave, for a jewel than for a maid. Thus the reason of one
contemplating nature prompts very different judgments from
those dictated by the necessity of the needy, or the desire of
the voluptuous; for the former considers what value a thing
in itself has in the scale of creation, while necessity considers
how it meets its need; reason looks for what the mental light
will judge to be true, while pleasure looks for what pleasantly
titillates the bodily sense. But of such consequence in
rational natures is the weight, so to speak, of will and of love,
that though in the order of nature angels rank above men, yet,
by the scale of justice, good men are of greater value than
bad angels.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>That the flaw of wickedness is not nature, but contrary to nature, and has
its origin, not in the Creator, but in the will.</i></p>

<p>It is with reference to the nature, then, and not to the
wickedness of the devil, that we are to understand these
words, "This is the beginning of God's handiwork;"<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> for,
without doubt, wickedness can be a flaw or vice<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> only where
the nature previously was not vitiated. Vice, too, is so contrary
to nature, that it cannot but damage it. And therefore
departure from God would be no vice, unless in a nature
whose property it was to abide with God. So that even the
wicked will is a strong proof of the goodness of the nature.
But God, as He is the supremely good Creator of good
natures, so is He of evil wills the most just Ruler; so that,
while they make an ill use of good natures, He makes a good
use even of evil wills. Accordingly, He caused the devil (good
by God's creation, wicked by his own will) to be cast down
from his high position, and to become the mockery of His
angels,&mdash;that is, He caused his temptations to benefit those
whom he wishes to injure by them. And because God, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
He created him, was certainly not ignorant of his future
malignity, and foresaw the good which He Himself would
bring out of his evil, therefore says the psalm, "This leviathan
whom Thou hast made to be a sport therein,"<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> that we may see
that, even while God in His goodness created him good, He
yet had already foreseen and arranged how He would make
use of him when he became wicked.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the beauty of the universe, which becomes, by God's ordinance, more
brilliant by the opposition of contraries.</i></p>

<p>For God would never have created any, I do not say angel,
but even man, whose future wickedness He foreknew, unless
He had equally known to what uses in behalf of the good
He could turn him, thus embellishing the course of the
ages, as it were an exquisite poem set off with antitheses.
For what are called antitheses are among the most elegant
of the ornaments of speech. They might be called in Latin
"oppositions," or, to speak more accurately, "contrapositions;"
but this word is not in common use among us,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> though the
Latin, and indeed the languages of all nations, avail themselves
of the same ornaments of style. In the Second Epistle
to the Corinthians the Apostle Paul also makes a graceful use
of antithesis, in that place where he says, "By the armour of
righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honour
and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers,
and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying,
and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful,
yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
having nothing, and yet possessing all things."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> As, then,
these oppositions of contraries lend beauty to the language,
so the beauty of the course of this world is achieved by the
opposition of contraries, arranged, as it were, by an eloquence
not of words, but of things. This is quite plainly stated in
the Book of Ecclesiasticus, in this way: "Good is set against
evil, and life against death: so is the sinner against the godly.
So look upon all the works of the Most High, and these are
two and two, one against another."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p class="center">19. <i>What, seemingly, we are to understand by the words, "God divided the
light from the darkness."</i></p>

<p>Accordingly, though the obscurity of the divine word has certainly
this advantage, that it causes many opinions about the
truth to be started and discussed, each reader seeing some fresh
meaning in it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure
passage should be either confirmed by the testimony of obvious
facts, or should be asserted in other and less ambiguous texts.
This obscurity is beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at
last reached after the discussion of many other interpretations,
or whether, though that sense remain concealed, other truths are
brought out by the discussion of the obscurity. To me it does
not seem incongruous with the working of God, if we understand
that the angels were created when that first light was
made, and that a separation was made between the holy and the
unclean angels, when, as is said, "God divided the light from
the darkness; and God called the light Day, and the darkness
He called Night." For He alone could make this discrimination,
who was able also, before they fell, to foreknow that they
would fall, and that, being deprived of the light of truth, they
would abide in the darkness of pride. For, so far as regards
the day and night, with which we are familiar, He commanded
those luminaries of heaven that are obvious to our
senses to divide between the light and the darkness. "Let
there be," He says, "lights in the firmament of the heaven, to
divide the day from the night;" and shortly after He says,
"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule
the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give
light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the
night, and to divide the light from the darkness."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> But
between that light, which is the holy company of the angels
spiritually radiant with the illumination of the truth, and
that opposing darkness, which is the noisome foulness of the
spiritual condition of those angels who are turned away from
the light of righteousness, only He Himself could divide, from
whom their wickedness (not of nature, but of will), while yet
it was future, could not be hidden or uncertain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">20. <i>Of the words which follow the separation of light and darkness, "And God
saw the light that it was good."</i></p>

<p>Then, we must not pass from this passage of Scripture
without noticing that when God said, "Let there be light,
and there was light," it was immediately added, "And God
saw the light that it was good." No such expression followed
the statement that He separated the light from the darkness,
and called the light Day and the darkness Night, lest the seal
of His approval might seem to be set on such darkness, as
well as on the light. For when the darkness was not subject
of disapprobation, as when it was divided by the heavenly
bodies from this light which our eyes discern, the statement
that God saw that it was good is inserted, not before, but
after the division is recorded. "And God set them," so runs
the passage, "in the firmament of the heaven, to give light
upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night,
and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that
it was good." For He approved of both, because both were
sinless. But where God said, "Let there be light, and there
was light; and God saw the light that it was good;" and
the narrative goes on, "and God divided the light from the
darkness: and God called the light Day, and the darkness He
called Night," there was not in this place subjoined the statement,
"And God saw that it was good," lest both should be
designated good, while one of them was evil, not by nature,
but by its own fault. And therefore, in this case, the light
alone received the approbation of the Creator, while the angelic
darkness, though it had been ordained, was yet not approved.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of God's eternal and unchangeable knowledge and will, whereby all He has
made pleased Him in the eternal design as well as in the actual result.</i></p>

<p>For what else is to be understood by that invariable refrain,
"And God saw that it was good," than the approval of the
work in its design, which is the wisdom of God? For certainly
God did not in the actual achievement of the work
first learn that it was good, but, on the contrary, nothing
would have been made had it not been first known by Him.
While, therefore, He sees that that is good which, had He not
seen it before it was made, would never have been made, it is
plain that He is not discovering, but teaching that it is good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
Plato, indeed, was bold enough to say that, when the universe
was completed, God was, as it were, elated with joy.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> And
Plato was not so foolish as to mean by this that God was
rendered more blessed by the novelty of His creation; but he
wished thus to indicate that the work now completed met with
its Maker's approval, as it had while yet in design. It is not
as if the knowledge of God were of various kinds, knowing
in different ways things which as yet are not, things which
are, and things which have been. For not in our fashion
does He look forward to what is future, nor at what is present,
nor back upon what is past; but in a manner quite different
and far and profoundly remote from our way of thinking. For
He does not pass from this to that by transition of thought,
but beholds all things with absolute unchangeableness; so
that of those things which emerge in time, the future, indeed,
are not yet, and the present are now, and the past no longer
are; but all of these are by Him comprehended in His stable
and eternal presence. Neither does He see in one fashion by
the eye, in another by the mind, for He is not composed of
mind and body; nor does His present knowledge differ from
that which it ever was or shall be, for those variations of time,
past, present, and future, though they alter our knowledge, do
not affect His, "with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
of turning."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Neither is there any growth from thought to
thought in the conceptions of Him whose spiritual vision
all things which He knows are at once embraced. For as
without any movement that time can measure, He Himself
moves all temporal things, so He knows all times with a
knowledge that time cannot measure. And therefore He
saw that what He had made was good, when He saw that it
was good to make it. And when He saw it made, He had
not on that account a twofold nor any way increased knowledge
of it; as if He had less knowledge before He made
what He saw. For certainly He would not be the perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
worker He is, unless His knowledge were so perfect as to
receive no addition from His finished works. Wherefore, if
the only object had been to inform us who made the light, it
had been enough to say, "God made the light;" and if further
information regarding the means by which it was made had
been intended, it would have sufficed to say, "And God said,
Let there be light, and there was light," that we might know
not only that God had made the world, but also that He had
made it by the word. But because it was right that three
leading truths regarding the creature be intimated to us, viz.,
who made it, by what means, and why, it is written, "God
said, Let there be light, and there was light. And God saw
the light that it was good." If, then, we ask who made it,
it was "God." If, by what means, He said "Let it be," and
it was. If we ask, why He made it, "it was good." Neither
is there any author more excellent than God, nor any skill
more efficacious than the word of God, nor any cause better
than that good might be created by the good God. This also
Plato has assigned as the most sufficient reason for the creation
of the world, that good works might be made by a good God;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
whether he read this passage, or, perhaps, was informed of
these things by those who had read them, or, by his quick-sighted
genius, penetrated to things spiritual and invisible
through the things that are created, or was instructed regarding
them by those who had discerned them.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Of those who do not approve of certain things which are a part of this good

<p>This cause, however, of a good creation, namely, the goodness

piously and carefully weighed, terminates all the controversies
of those who inquire into the origin of the world, has not been
recognised by some heretics,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> because there are, forsooth, many
things, such as fire, frost, wild beasts, and so forth, which do
not suit but injure this thin-blooded and frail mortality of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
flesh, which is at present under just punishment. They do
not consider how admirable these things are in their own
places, how excellent in their own natures, how beautifully
adjusted to the rest of creation, and how much grace they
contribute to the universe by their own contributions as to a
commonwealth; and how serviceable they are even to ourselves,
if we use them with a knowledge of their fit adaptations,&mdash;so
that even poisons, which are destructive when used
injudiciously, become wholesome and medicinal when used
in conformity with their qualities and design; just as, on the
other hand, those things which give us pleasure, such as food,
drink, and the light of the sun, are found to be hurtful when
immoderately or unseasonably used. And thus divine providence
admonishes us not foolishly to vituperate things, but to
investigate their utility with care; and, where our mental
capacity or infirmity is at fault, to believe that there is a
utility, though hidden, as we have experienced that there were
other things which we all but failed to discover. For this
concealment of the use of things is itself either an exercise of
our humility or a levelling of our pride; for no nature at all
is evil, and this is a name for nothing but the want of good.
But from things earthly to things heavenly, from the visible
to the invisible, there are some things better than others; and
for this purpose are they unequal, in order that they might
all exist. Now God is in such sort a great worker in great
things, that He is not less in little things,&mdash;for these little
things are to be measured not by their own greatness (which
does not exist), but by the wisdom of their Designer; as, in
the visible appearance of a man, if one eyebrow be shaved off,
how nearly nothing is taken from the body, but how much
from the beauty!&mdash;for that is not constituted by bulk, but by
the proportion and arrangement of the members. But we
do not greatly wonder that persons, who suppose that some
evil nature has been generated and propagated by a kind of
opposing principle proper to it, refuse to admit that the cause
of the creation was this, that the good God produced a good
creation. For they believe that He was driven to this enterprise
of creation by the urgent necessity of repulsing the evil
that warred against Him, and that He mixed His good nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
with the evil for the sake of restraining and conquering it;
and that this nature of His, being thus shamefully polluted,
and most cruelly oppressed and held captive, He labours to
cleanse and deliver it, and with all His pains does not wholly
succeed; but such part of it as could not be cleansed from
that defilement is to serve as a prison and chain of the conquered
and incarcerated enemy. The Manichæans would not
drivel, or rather, rave in such a style as this, if they believed
the nature of God to be, as it is, unchangeable and absolutely
incorruptible, and subject to no injury; and if, moreover, they
held in Christian sobriety, that the soul which has shown
itself capable of being altered for the worse by its own will,
and of being corrupted by sin, and so, of being deprived of the
light of eternal truth,&mdash;that this soul, I say, is not a part of
God, nor of the same nature as God, but is created by Him,
and is far different from its Creator.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the error in which the doctrine of Origen is involved.</i></p>

<p>But it is much more surprising that some even of those
who, with ourselves, believe that there is one only source of
all things, and that no nature which is not divine can exist
unless originated by that Creator, have yet refused to accept
with a good and simple faith this so good and simple a reason
of the world's creation, that a good God made it good; and
that the things created, being different from God, were inferior
to Him, and yet were good, being created by none other than
He. But they say that souls, though not, indeed, parts of God,
but created by Him, sinned by abandoning God; that, in proportion
to their various sins, they merited different degrees of
debasement from heaven to earth, and diverse bodies as prison-houses;
and that this is the world, and this the cause of its
creation, not the production of good things, but the restraining
of evil. Origen is justly blamed for holding this opinion. For
in the books which he entitles &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957;, that is, <i>Of origins</i>,
this is his sentiment, this his utterance. And I cannot sufficiently
express my astonishment, that a man so erudite and
well versed in ecclesiastical literature, should not have observed,
in the first place, how opposed this is to the meaning of this
authoritative Scripture, which, in recounting all the works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
God, regularly adds, "And God saw that it was good;" and,
when all were completed, inserts the words, "And God saw
everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good."<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
Was it not obviously meant to be understood that there was
no other cause of the world's creation than that good creatures
should be made by a good God? In this creation, had no one
sinned, the world would have been filled and beautified with
natures good without exception; and though there is sin, all
things are not therefore full of sin, for the great majority of
the heavenly inhabitants preserve their nature's integrity.
And the sinful will, though it violated the order of its own
nature, did not on that account escape the laws of God, who
justly orders all things for good. For as the beauty of a
picture is increased by well-managed shadows, so, to the eye
that has skill to discern it, the universe is beautified even by
sinners, though, considered by themselves, their deformity is
a sad blemish.</p>

<p>In the second place, Origen, and all who think with him,
ought to have seen that if it were the true opinion that the
world was created in order that souls might, for their sins, be
accommodated with bodies in which they should be shut up
as in houses of correction, the more venial sinners receiving
lighter and more ethereal bodies, while the grosser and graver
sinners received bodies more crass and grovelling, then it
would follow that the devils, who are deepest in wickedness,
ought, rather than even wicked men, to have earthly bodies, since
these are the grossest and least ethereal of all. But in point
of fact, that we might see that the deserts of souls are not to
be estimated by the qualities of bodies, the wickedest devil
possesses an ethereal body, while man, wicked, it is true, but
with a wickedness small and venial in comparison with his,
received even before his sin a body of clay. And what more
foolish assertion can be advanced than that God, by this sun of
ours, did not design to benefit the material creation, or lend
lustre to its loveliness, and therefore created one single sun
for this single world, but that it so happened that one soul
only had so sinned as to deserve to be enclosed in such a
body as it is? On this principle, if it had chanced that not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
one, but two, yea, or ten, or a hundred had sinned similarly,
and with a like degree of guilt, then this world would have
one hundred suns. And that such is not the case, is due not
to the considerate foresight of the Creator, contriving the
safety and beauty of things material, but rather to the fact
that so fine a quality of sinning was hit upon by only one
soul, so that it alone has merited such a body. Manifestly
persons holding such opinions should aim at confining, not
souls of which they know not what they say, but themselves,
lest they fall, and deservedly, far indeed from the truth. And
as to these three answers which I formerly recommended when
in the case of any creature the questions are put, Who made
it? By what means? Why? that it should be replied, God, By
the Word, Because it was good,&mdash;as to these three answers, it
is very questionable whether the Trinity itself is thus mystically
indicated, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, or whether there is some good reason for this acceptation
in this passage of Scripture,&mdash;this, I say, is questionable,
and one can't be expected to explain everything in one volume.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the divine Trinity, and the indications of its presence scattered everywhere
among its works.</i></p>

<p>We believe, we maintain, we faithfully preach, that the
Father begat the Word, that is, Wisdom, by which all things
were made, the only-begotten Son, one as the Father is one,
eternal as the Father is eternal, and, equally with the Father,
supremely good; and that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit alike
of Father and of Son, and is Himself consubstantial and co-eternal
with both; and that this whole is a Trinity by reason
of the individuality<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> of the persons, and one God by reason
of the indivisible divine substance, as also one Almighty by
reason of the indivisible omnipotence; yet so that, when we
inquire regarding each singly, it is said that each is God
and Almighty; and, when we speak of all together, it is said
that there are not three Gods, nor three Almighties, but one
God Almighty; so great is the indivisible unity of these
Three, which requires that it be so stated. But, whether
the Holy Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, who are both
good, can be with propriety called the goodness of both, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
He is common to both, I do not presume to determine
hastily. Nevertheless, I would have less hesitation in saying
that He is the holiness of both, not as if He were a divine
attribute merely, but Himself also the divine substance, and
the third person in the Trinity. I am the rather emboldened
to make this statement, because, though the Father is a spirit,
and the Son a spirit, and the Father holy, and the Son holy,
yet the third person is distinctively called the Holy Spirit,
as if He were the substantial holiness consubstantial with the
other two. But if the divine goodness is nothing else than
the divine holiness, then certainly it is a reasonable studiousness,
and not presumptuous intrusion, to inquire whether the
same Trinity be not hinted at in an enigmatical mode of
speech, by which our inquiry is stimulated, when it is written
who made each creature, and by what means, and why. For
it is the Father of the Word who said, Let there be. And
that which was made when He spoke was certainly made by
means of the Word. And by the words, "God saw that it
was good," it is sufficiently intimated that God made what
was made not from any necessity, nor for the sake of supplying
any want, but solely from His own goodness, <i>i.e.</i>, because
it was good. And this is stated after the creation had taken
place, that there might be no doubt that the thing made satisfied
the goodness on account of which it was made. And if
we are right in understanding that this goodness is the Holy
Spirit, then the whole Trinity is revealed to us in the creation.
In this, too, is the origin, the enlightenment, the blessedness
of the holy city which is above among the holy angels.
For if we inquire whence it is, God created it; or whence its
wisdom, God illumined it; or whence its blessedness, God is
its bliss. It has its form by subsisting in Him; its enlightenment
by contemplating Him; its joy by abiding in Him. It
is; it sees; it loves. In God's eternity is its life; in God's
truth its light; in God's goodness its joy.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of the division of philosophy into three parts.</i></p>

<p>As far as one can judge, it is for the same reason that
philosophers have aimed at a threefold division of science,
or rather, were enabled to see that there was a threefold division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
(for they did not invent, but only discovered it), of which
one part is called physical, another logical, the third ethical.
The Latin equivalents of these names are now naturalized in
the writings of many authors, so that these divisions are called
natural, rational, and moral, on which I have touched slightly
in the eighth book. Not that I would conclude that these
philosophers, in this threefold division, had any thought of a
trinity in God, although Plato is said to have been the first
to discover and promulgate this distribution, and he saw that
God alone could be the author of nature, the bestower of intelligence,
and the kindler of love by which life becomes good
and blessed. But certain it is that, though philosophers disagree
both regarding the nature of things, and the mode of
investigating truth, and of the good to which all our actions
ought to tend, yet in these three great general questions all
their intellectual energy is spent. And though there be a
confusing diversity of opinion, every man striving to establish
his own opinion in regard to each of these questions, yet no
one of them all doubts that nature has some cause, science
some method, life some end and aim. Then, again, there are
three things which every artificer must possess if he is to effect
anything,&mdash;nature, education, practice. Nature is to be judged
by capacity, education by knowledge, practice by its fruit. I
am aware that, properly speaking, fruit is what one enjoys, use
[practice] what one uses. And this seems to be the difference
between them, that we are said to <i>enjoy</i> that which in itself,
and irrespective of other ends, delights us; to <i>use</i> that which
we seek for the sake of some end beyond. For which reason
the things of time are to be used rather than enjoyed, that we
may deserve to enjoy things eternal; and not as those perverse
creatures who would fain enjoy money and use God,&mdash;not
spending money for God's sake, but worshipping God for
money's sake. However, in common parlance, we both use
fruits and enjoy uses. For we correctly speak of the "fruits
of the field," which certainly we all use in the present life.
And it was in accordance with this usage that I said that
there were three things to be observed in a man, nature,
education, practice. From these the philosophers have elaborated,
as I said, the threefold division of that science by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
which a blessed life is attained: the natural having respect to
nature, the rational to education, the moral to practice. If,
then, we were ourselves the authors of our nature, we should
have generated knowledge in ourselves, and should not require
to reach it by education, <i>i.e.</i>, by learning it from others. Our
love, too, proceeding from ourselves and returning to us, would
suffice to make our life blessed, and would stand in need of no
extraneous enjoyment. But now, since our nature has God as
its requisite author, it is certain that we must have Him for
our teacher that we may be wise; Him, too, to dispense to us
spiritual sweetness that we may be blessed.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Of the image of the supreme Trinity, which we find in some sort in human
nature even in its present state.</i></p>

<p>And we indeed recognise in ourselves the image of God,
that is, of the supreme Trinity, an image which, though it be
not equal to God, or rather, though it be very far removed from
Him,&mdash;being neither co-eternal, nor, to say all in a word, consubstantial
with Him,&mdash;is yet nearer to Him in nature than
any other of His works, and is destined to be yet restored,
that it may bear a still closer resemblance. For we both are,
and know that we are, and delight in our being, and our
knowledge of it. Moreover, in these three things no true-seeming
illusion disturbs us; for we do not come into contact
with these by some bodily sense, as we perceive the things
outside of us,&mdash;colours, <i>e.g.</i>, by seeing, sounds by hearing,
smells by smelling, tastes by tasting, hard and soft objects by
touching,&mdash;of all which sensible objects it is the images
resembling them, but not themselves which we perceive in
the mind and hold in the memory, and which excite us to
desire the objects. But, without any delusive representation
of images or phantasms, I am most certain that I am, and
that I know and delight in this. In respect of these truths,
I am not at all afraid of the arguments of the Academicians,
who say, What if you are deceived? For if I am deceived,
I am.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> For he who is not, cannot be deceived; and if I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
deceived, by this same token I am. And since I am if I am
deceived, how am I deceived in believing that I am? for it is
certain that I am if I am deceived. Since, therefore, I, the
person deceived, should be, even if I were deceived, certainly
I am not deceived in this knowledge that I am. And, consequently,
neither am I deceived in knowing that I know.
For, as I know that I am, so I know this also, that I know.
And when I love these two things, I add to them a certain
third thing, namely, my love, which is of equal moment. For
neither am I deceived in this, that I love, since in those
things which I love I am not deceived; though even if these
were false, it would still be true that I <i>loved</i> false things.
For how could I justly be blamed and prohibited from loving
false things, if it were false that I loved them? But, since
they are true and real, who doubts that when they are loved,
the love of them is itself true and real? Further, as there is
no one who does not wish to be happy, so there is no one
who does not wish to be. For how can he be happy, if he
is nothing?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of existence, and knowledge of it, and the love of both.</i></p>

<p>And truly the very fact of existing is by some natural spell
so pleasant, that even the wretched are, for no other reason,
unwilling to perish; and, when they feel that they are
wretched, wish not that they themselves be annihilated, but
that their misery be so. Take even those who, both in their
own esteem, and in point of fact, are utterly wretched, and
who are reckoned so, not only by wise men on account of
their folly, but by those who count themselves blessed, and
who think them wretched because they are poor and destitute,&mdash;if
any one should give these men an immortality, in
which their misery should be deathless, and should offer the
alternative, that if they shrank from existing eternally in the
same misery they might be annihilated, and exist nowhere
at all, nor in any condition, on the instant they would joyfully,
nay exultantly, make election to exist always, even in
such a condition, rather than not exist at all. The well-known
feeling of such men witnesses to this. For when we
see that they fear to die, and will rather live in such misfortune
than end it by death, is it not obvious enough how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
nature shrinks from annihilation? And, accordingly, when
they know that they must die, they seek, as a great boon,
that this mercy be shown them, that they may a little longer
live in the same misery, and delay to end it by death. And
so they indubitably prove with what glad alacrity they would
accept immortality, even though it secured to them endless
destruction. What! do not even all irrational animals, to
whom such calculations are unknown, from the huge dragons
down to the least worms, all testify that they wish to exist,
and therefore shun death by every movement in their power?
Nay, the very plants and shrubs, which have no such life as
enables them to shun destruction by movements we can see,
do not they all seek, in their own fashion, to conserve their
existence, by rooting themselves more and more deeply in the
earth, that so they may draw nourishment, and throw out
healthy branches towards the sky? In fine, even the lifeless
bodies, which want not only sensation but seminal life, yet
either seek the upper air or sink deep, or are balanced in an
intermediate position, so that they may protect their existence
in that situation where they can exist in most accordance
with their nature.</p>

<p>And how much human nature loves the knowledge of its
existence, and how it shrinks from being deceived, will be
sufficiently understood from this fact, that every man prefers
to grieve in a sane mind, rather than to be glad in madness.
And this grand and wonderful instinct belongs to men alone
of all animals; for, though some of them have keener eyesight
than ourselves for this world's light, they cannot attain to that
spiritual light with which our mind is somehow irradiated,
so that we can form right judgments of all things. For our
power to judge is proportioned to our acceptance of this light.
Nevertheless, the irrational animals, though they have not
knowledge, have certainly something resembling knowledge;
whereas the other material things are said to be sensible, not
because they have senses, but because they are the objects of
our senses. Yet among plants, their nourishment and generation
have some resemblance to sensible life. However, both
these and all material things have their causes hidden in their
nature; but their outward forms, which lend beauty to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
visible structure of the world, are perceived by our senses, so
that they seem to wish to compensate for their own want of
knowledge by providing us with knowledge. But we perceive
them by our bodily senses in such a way that we do not
judge of them by these senses. For we have another and far
superior sense, belonging to the inner man, by which we perceive
what things are just, and what unjust,&mdash;just by means
of an intelligible idea, unjust by the want of it. This sense is
aided in its functions neither by the eyesight, nor by the
orifice of the ear, nor by the air-holes of the nostrils, nor by
the palate's taste, nor by any bodily touch. By it I am
assured both that I am, and that I know this; and these two
I love, and in the same manner I am assured that I love
them.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>28. <i>Whether we ought to love the love itself with which we love our existence and
our knowledge of it, that so we may more nearly resemble the image of
the divine Trinity.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We have said as much as the scope of this work demands
regarding these two things, to wit, our existence, and our
knowledge of it, and how much they are loved by us, and
how there is found even in the lower creatures a kind of likeness
of these things, and yet with a difference. We have yet
to speak of the love wherewith they are loved, to determine
whether this love itself is loved. And doubtless it is; and
this is the proof. Because in men who are justly loved, it is
rather love itself that is loved; for he is not justly called a
good man who knows what is good, but who loves it. Is it
not then obvious that we love in ourselves the very love
wherewith we love whatever good we love? For there is
also a love wherewith we love that which we ought not to
love; and this love is hated by him who loves that wherewith
he loves what ought to be loved. For it is quite possible
for both to exist in one man. And this co-existence is
good for a man, to the end that this love which conduces to
our living well may grow, and the other, which leads us to
evil may decrease, until our whole life be perfectly healed
and transmuted into good. For if we were beasts, we should
love the fleshly and sensual life, and this would be our
sufficient good; and when it was well with us in respect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
it, we should seek nothing beyond. In like manner, if we
were trees, we could not, indeed, in the strict sense of the
word, love anything; nevertheless we should seem, as it were,
to long for that by which we might become more abundantly
and luxuriantly fruitful. If we were stones, or waves, or
wind, or flame, or anything of that kind, we should want,
indeed, both sensation and life, yet should possess a kind of
attraction towards our own proper position and natural order.
For the specific gravity of bodies is, as it were, their love,
whether they are carried downwards by their weight, or upwards
by their levity. For the body is borne by its gravity,
as the spirit by love, whithersoever it is borne.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> But we are
men, created in the image of our Creator, whose eternity is
true, and whose truth is eternal, whose love is eternal and
true, and who Himself is the eternal, true, and adorable Trinity,
without confusion, without separation; and, therefore, while, as
we run over all the works which He has established, we may
detect, as it were, His footprints, now more and now less
distinct even in those things that are beneath us, since they
could not so much as exist, or be bodied forth in any shape,
or follow and observe any law, had they not been made by
Him who supremely is, and is supremely good and supremely
wise; yet in ourselves beholding His image, let us, like that
younger son of the gospel, come to ourselves, and arise and
return to Him from whom by our sin we had departed.
There our being will have no death, our knowledge no error,
our love no mishap. But now, though we are assured of our
possession of these three things, not on the testimony of others,
but by our own consciousness of their presence, and because
we see them with our own most truthful interior vision, yet,
as we cannot of ourselves know how long they are to continue,
and whether they shall never cease to be, and what issue their
good or bad use will lead to, we seek for others who can
acquaint us of these things, if we have not already found
them. Of the trustworthiness of these witnesses, there will,
not now, but subsequently, be an opportunity of speaking.
But in this book let us go on as we have begun, with God's
help, to speak of the city of God, not in its state of pilgrimage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
and mortality, but as it exists ever immortal in the
heavens,&mdash;that is, let us speak of the holy angels who maintain
their allegiance to God, who never were, nor ever shall be,
apostate, between whom and those who forsook light eternal
and became darkness, God, as we have already said, made at
the first a separation.</p>

which they see the causes of His works in the art of the worker, before

<p>Those holy angels come to the knowledge of God not by
audible words, but by the presence to their souls of immutable
truth, <i>i.e.</i>, of the only-begotten Word of God; and
they know this Word Himself, and the Father, and their
Holy Spirit, and that this Trinity is indivisible, and that
the three persons of it are one substance, and that there
are not three Gods but one God; and this they so know, that
it is better understood by them than we are by ourselves.
Thus, too, they know the creature also, not in itself, but by this
better way, in the wisdom of God, as if in the art by which
it was created; and, consequently, they know themselves
better in God than in themselves, though they have also
this latter knowledge. For they were created, and are
different from their Creator. In Him, therefore, they have,
as it were, a noonday knowledge; in themselves, a twilight
knowledge, according to our former explanations.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> For there
is a great difference between knowing a thing in the design

described on paper; and justice is known in one way in the
unchangeable truth, in another in the spirit of a just man.
So is it with all other things,&mdash;as, the firmament between the
water above and below, which was called the heaven; the
gathering of the waters beneath, and the laying bare of the
dry land, and the production of plants and trees; the creation
of sun, moon, and stars; and of the animals out of the waters,
fowls, and fish, and monsters of the deep; and of everything
that walks or creeps on the earth, and of man himself, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
excels all that is on the earth,&mdash;all these things are known
in one way by the angels in the Word of God, in which they
see the eternally abiding causes and reasons according to which
they were made, and in another way in themselves: in the
former, with a clearer knowledge; in the latter, with a knowledge
dimmer, and rather of the bare works than of the design.
Yet, when these works are referred to the praise and adoration
of the Creator Himself, it is as if morning dawned in the
minds of those who contemplate them.</p>


<p class="center">30. <i>Of the perfection of the number six, which is the first of the numbers
which is composed of its aliquot parts.</i></p>

<p>These works are recorded to have been completed in six
days (the same day being six times repeated), because six
is a perfect number,&mdash;not because God required a protracted
time, as if He could not at once create all things, which then
should mark the course of time by the movements proper to
them, but because the perfection of the works was signified
by the number six. For the number six is the first which is
made up of its own<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> parts, <i>i.e.</i>, of its sixth, third, and half,
which are respectively one, two, and three, and which make
a total of six. In this way of looking at a number, those are
said to be its parts which exactly divide it, as a half, a third,
a fourth, or a fraction with any denominator,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, four is a
part of nine, but not therefore an aliquot part; but one is, for
it is the ninth part; and three is, for it is the third. Yet
these two parts, the ninth and the third, or one and three, are
far from making its whole sum of nine. So again, in the
number ten, four is a part, yet does not divide it; but one is
an aliquot part, for it is a tenth; so it has a fifth, which is
two; and a half, which is five. But these three parts, a tenth,
a fifth, and a half, or one, two, and five, added together, do not
make ten, but eight. Of the number twelve, again, the parts
added together exceed the whole; for it has a twelfth, that is,
one; a sixth, or two; a fourth, which is three; a third, which
is four; and a half, which is six. But one, two, three, four, and
six make up, not twelve, but more, viz. sixteen. So much I
have thought fit to state for the sake of illustrating the perfection
of the number six, which is, as I said, the first which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
is exactly made up of its own parts added together; and in
this number of days God finished His work.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> And, therefore,
we must not despise the science of numbers, which, in many
passages of holy Scripture, is found to be of eminent service
to the careful interpreter.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Neither has it been without
reason numbered among God's praises, "Thou hast ordered
all things in number, and measure, and weight."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>


<p class="center">31. <i>Of the seventh day, in which completeness and repose are celebrated.</i></p>

<p>But, on the seventh day (<i>i.e.</i>, the same day repeated seven
times, which number is also a perfect one, though for another
reason), the rest of God is set forth, and then, too, we first
hear of its being hallowed. So that God did not wish to
hallow this day by His works, but by His rest, which has no
evening, for it is not a creature; so that, being known in one
way in the Word of God, and in another in itself, it should
make a twofold knowledge, daylight and dusk (day and evening).
Much more might be said about the perfection of the
number seven, but this book is already too long, and I fear
lest I should seem to catch at an opportunity of airing my
little smattering of science more childishly than profitably.
I must speak, therefore, in moderation and with dignity, lest,
in too keenly following "number," I be accused of forgetting
"weight" and "measure." Suffice it here to say, that three
is the first whole number that is odd, four the first that is
even, and of these two, seven is composed. On this account
it is often put for all numbers together, as, "A just man
falleth seven times, and riseth up again,"<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>&mdash;that is, let him
fall never so often, he will not perish (and this was meant
to be understood not of sins, but of afflictions conducing to
lowliness). Again, "Seven times a day will I praise Thee,"<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
which elsewhere is expressed thus, "I will bless the Lord <i>at
all times</i>."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> And many such instances are found in the divine
authorities, in which the number seven is, as I said, commonly
used to express the whole, or the completeness of anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
And so the Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord says, "He will
teach you all truth,"<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> is signified by this number.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> In it is
the rest of God, the rest His people find in Him. For rest is
in the whole, <i>i.e.</i> in perfect completeness, while in the part
there is labour. And thus we labour as long as we know in
part; "but when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> It is even with toil
we search into the Scriptures themselves. But the holy angels,
towards whose society and assembly we sigh while in this
our toilsome pilgrimage, as they already abide in their eternal
home, so do they enjoy perfect facility of knowledge and
felicity of rest. It is without difficulty that they help us;
for their spiritual movements, pure and free, cost them no
effort.</p>


<p class="center">32. <i>Of the opinion that the angels were created before the world.</i></p>

<p>But if some one oppose our opinion, and say that the
holy angels are not referred to when it is said, "Let there
be light, and there was light;" if he suppose or teach that
some material light, then first created, was meant, and that
the angels were created, not only before the firmament dividing
the waters and named "the heaven," but also before the
time signified in the words, "In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth;" if he allege that this phrase, "In
the beginning," does not mean that nothing was made before
(for the angels were), but that God made all things by His
Wisdom or Word, who is named in Scripture "the Beginning,"
as He Himself, in the gospel, replied to the Jews when they
asked Him who He was, that He was the Beginning;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>&mdash;I will
not contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest
satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning
of the book of Genesis. For, having said, "In the Beginning
God created the heaven and the earth," meaning that the
Father made them in the Son (as the psalm testifies where
it says, "How manifold are Thy works, O Lord! in Wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
hast Thou made them all"<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>), a little afterwards mention is
fitly made of the Holy Spirit also. For, when it had been
told us what kind of earth God created at first, or what the
mass or matter was which God, under the name of "heaven
and earth," had provided for the construction of the world, as
is told in the additional words, "And the earth was without
form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
deep," then, for the sake of completing the mention of the
Trinity, it is immediately added, "And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters." Let each one, then,
take it as he pleases; for it is so profound a passage, that it
may well suggest, for the exercise of the reader's tact, many
opinions, and none of them widely departing from the rule of
faith. At the same time, let none doubt that the holy angels in
their heavenly abodes are, though not, indeed, co-eternal with
God, yet secure and certain of eternal and true felicity. To
their company the Lord teaches that His little ones belong; and
not only says, "They shall be equal to the angels of God,"<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> but
shows, too, what blessed contemplation the angels themselves
enjoy, saying, "Take heed that ye despise not one of these
little ones: for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do
always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>


<p class="center">33. <i>Of the two different and dissimilar communities of angels, which are not
inappropriately signified by the names light and darkness.</i></p>

<p>That certain angels sinned, and were thrust down to the
lowest parts of this world, where they are, as it were, incarcerated
till their final damnation in the day of judgment, the
Apostle Peter very plainly declares, when he says that "God
spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell,
and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto
judgment."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Who, then, can doubt that God, either in foreknowledge
or in act, separated between these and the rest?
And who will dispute that the rest are justly called "light?"
For even we who are yet living by faith, hoping only and not
yet enjoying equality with them, are already called "light" by
the apostle: "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are
ye light in the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> But as for these apostate angels, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
who understand or believe them to be worse than unbelieving
men are well aware that they are called "darkness."
Wherefore, though light and darkness are to be taken in their
literal signification in these passages of Genesis in which it is
said, "God said, Let there be light, and there was light," and
"God divided the light from the darkness," yet, for our part,
we understand these two societies of angels,&mdash;the one enjoying
God, the other swelling with pride; the one to whom it is
said, "Praise ye Him, all His angels,"<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> the other whose prince
says, "All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down
and worship me;"<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> the one blazing with the holy love of God,
the other reeking with the unclean lust of self-advancement.
And since, as it is written, "God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace unto the humble,"<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> we may say, the one dwelling
in the heaven of heavens, the other cast thence, and raging
through the lower regions of the air; the one tranquil in the
brightness of piety, the other tempest-tossed with beclouding
desires; the one, at God's pleasure, tenderly succouring, justly
avenging,&mdash;the other, set on by its own pride, boiling with the
lust of subduing and hurting; the one the minister of God's
goodness to the utmost of their good pleasure, the other held
in by God's power from doing the harm it would; the former
laughing at the latter when it does good unwillingly by its
persecutions, the latter envying the former when it gathers in
its pilgrims. These two angelic communities, then, dissimilar
and contrary to one another, the one both by nature good and
by will upright, the other also good by nature but by will
depraved, as they are exhibited in other and more explicit
passages of holy writ, so I think they are spoken of in this
book of Genesis under the names of light and darkness; and
even if the author perhaps had a different meaning, yet our
discussion of the obscure language has not been wasted time;
for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet
we have adhered to the rule of faith, which is sufficiently ascertained
by the faithful from other passages of equal authority.
For, though it is the material works of God which are here
spoken of, they have certainly a resemblance to the spiritual,
so that Paul can say, "Ye are all the children of light, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
If, on the other hand, the author of Genesis saw in
the words what we see, then our discussion reaches this more
satisfactory conclusion, that the man of God, so eminently and
divinely wise, or rather, that the Spirit of God who by him
recorded God's works which were finished on the sixth day,
may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the
angels, whether he included them in the words "in the beginning,"
because He made them first, or, which seems most
likely, because He made them in the only-begotten Word.
And, under these names heaven and earth, the whole creation
is signified, either as divided into spiritual and material, which
seems the more likely, or into the two great parts of the world
in which all created things are contained, so that, first of all,
the creation is presented in sum, and then its parts are enumerated
according to the mystic number of the days.</p>

<p>34. <i>Of the idea that the angels were meant where the separation of the waters
by the firmament is spoken of, and of that other idea that the waters were

<p>Some,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> however, have supposed that the angelic hosts are
somehow referred to under the name of waters, and that this
is what is meant by, "Let there be a firmament in the midst
of the waters:"<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> that the waters above should be understood of
the angels, and those below either of the visible waters, or of
the multitude of bad angels, or of the nations of men. If
this be so, then it does not here appear when the angels were
created, but when they were separated. Though there have
not been wanting men foolish and wicked enough<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> to deny
that the waters were made by God, because it is nowhere
written, "God said, Let there be waters." With equal folly
they might say the same of the earth, for nowhere do we read,
"God said, Let the earth be." But, say they, it is written,
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
Yes, and there the water is meant, for both are included in
one word. For "the sea is His," as the psalm says, "and
He made it; and His hands formed the dry land."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> But
those who would understand the angels by the waters above
the skies have a difficulty about the specific gravity of the
elements, and fear that the waters, owing to their fluidity and
weight, could not be set in the upper parts of the world. So
that, if they were to construct a man upon their own principles,
they would not put in his head any moist humours, or
"phlegm" as the Greeks call it, and which acts the part of
water among the elements of our body. But, in God's handiwork,
the head is the seat of the phlegm, and surely most
fitly; and yet, according to their supposition, so absurdly
that if we were not aware of the fact, and were informed by
this same record that God had put a moist and cold and
therefore heavy humour in the uppermost part of man's body,
these world-weighers would refuse belief. And if they were
confronted with the authority of Scripture, they would maintain
that something else must be meant by the words. But,
were we to investigate and discover all the details which are
written in this divine book regarding the creation of the
world, we should have much to say, and should widely digress
from the proposed aim of this work. Since, then, we have
now said what seemed needful regarding these two diverse
and contrary communities of angels, in which the origin of
the two human communities (of which we intend to speak
anon) is also found, let us at once bring this book also to a
conclusion.</p>

<p>AUGUSTINE FIRST INSTITUTES TWO INQUIRIES REGARDING THE ANGELS; NAMELY,

WHAT IS THE REASON OF THE BLESSEDNESS OF THE GOOD, AND THE MISERY
OF THE EVIL? AFTERWARDS HE TREATS OF THE CREATION OF MAN, AND
TEACHES THAT HE IS NOT FROM ETERNITY, BUT WAS CREATED, AND BY
NONE OTHER THAN GOD.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>That the nature of the angels, both good and bad, is one and the same.</i></p>

<p>It has already, in the preceding book, been shown how the
two cities originated among the angels. Before I speak
of the creation of man, and show how the cities took their
rise, so far as regards the race of rational mortals, I see that
I must first, so far as I can, adduce what may demonstrate
that it is not incongruous and unsuitable to speak of a society
composed of angels and men together; so that there are not
four cities or societies,&mdash;two, namely, of angels, and as many
of men,&mdash;but rather two in all, one composed of the good, the
other of the wicked, angels or men indifferently.</p>

<p>That the contrary propensities in good and bad angels have
arisen, not from a difference in their nature and origin, since
God, the good Author and Creator of all essences, created them
both, but from a difference in their wills and desires, it is impossible
to doubt. While some stedfastly continued in that which
was the common good of all, namely, in God Himself, and in
His eternity, truth, and love; others, being enamoured rather
of their own power, as if they could be their own good, lapsed
to this private good of their own, from that higher and beatific
good which was common to all, and, bartering the lofty dignity
of eternity for the inflation of pride, the most assured verity
for the slyness of vanity, uniting love for factious partisanship,
they became proud, deceived, envious. The cause, therefore,
of the blessedness of the good is adherence to God. And so
the cause of the others' misery will be found in the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
that is, in their not adhering to God. Wherefore, if when
the question is asked, why are the former blessed, it is rightly
answered, because they adhere to God; and when it is asked,
why are the latter miserable, it is rightly answered, because
they do not adhere to God,&mdash;then there is no other good for
the rational or intellectual creature save God only. Thus,
though it is not every creature that can be blessed (for beasts,
trees, stones, and things of that kind have not this capacity),
yet that creature which has the capacity cannot be blessed of
itself, since it is created out of nothing, but only by Him by
whom it has been created. For it is blessed by the possession
of that whose loss makes it miserable. He, then, who is
blessed not in another, but in himself, cannot be miserable,
because he cannot lose himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly we say that there is no unchangeable good but
the one, true, blessed God; that the things which He made are
indeed good because from Him, yet mutable because made not
out of Him, but out of nothing. Although, therefore, they are
not the supreme good, for God is a greater good, yet those
mutable things which can adhere to the immutable good, and
so be blessed, are very good; for so completely is He their
good, that without Him they cannot but be wretched. And
the other created things in the universe are not better on this
account, that they cannot be miserable. For no one would
say that the other members of the body are superior to the
eyes, because they cannot be blind. But as the sentient
nature, even when it feels pain, is superior to the stony, which
can feel none, so the rational nature, even when wretched, is
more excellent than that which lacks reason or feeling, and
can therefore experience no misery. And since this is so,
then in this nature which has been created so excellent, that
though it be mutable itself, it can yet secure its blessedness
by adhering to the immutable good, the supreme God; and
since it is not satisfied unless it be perfectly blessed, and
cannot be thus blessed save in God,&mdash;in this nature, I say,
not to adhere to God, is manifestly a fault.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Now every fault
injures the nature, and is consequently contrary to the nature.
The creature, therefore, which cleaves to God, differs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
those who do not, not by nature, but by fault; and yet by
this very fault the nature itself is proved to be very noble
and admirable. For that nature is certainly praised, the fault
of which is justly blamed. For we justly blame the fault
because it mars the praiseworthy nature. As, then, when we
say that blindness is a defect of the eyes, we prove that sight
belongs to the nature of the eyes; and when we say that
deafness is a defect of the ears, hearing is thereby proved to
belong to their nature;&mdash;so, when we say that it is a fault of
the angelic creature that it does not cleave to God, we hereby
most plainly declare that it pertained to its nature to cleave
to God. And who can worthily conceive or express how
great a glory that is, to cleave to God, so as to live to Him,
to draw wisdom from Him, to delight in Him, and to enjoy
this so great good, without death, error, or grief? And thus,
since every vice is an injury of the nature, that very vice of
the wicked angels, their departure from God, is sufficient proof
that God created their nature so good, that it is an injury to
it not to be with God.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>That there is no entity</i><a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> <i>contrary to the divine, because nonentity seems to be
that which is wholly opposite to Him who supremely and always is.</i></p>

<p>This may be enough to prevent any one from supposing,
when we speak of the apostate angels, that they could have
another nature, derived, as it were, from some different origin,
and not from God. From the great impiety of this error we
shall disentangle ourselves the more readily and easily, the
more distinctly we understand that which God spoke by the
angel when He sent Moses to the children of Israel: "I am
that I am."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> For since God is the supreme existence, that is
to say, supremely is, and is therefore unchangeable, the things
that He made He empowered to be, but not to be supremely
like Himself. To some He communicated a more ample, to
others a more limited existence, and thus arranged the natures
of beings in ranks. For as from <i>sapere</i> comes <i>sapientia</i>, so
from <i>esse</i> comes <i>essentia</i>,&mdash;a new word indeed, which the old
Latin writers did not use, but which is naturalized in our
day,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> that our language may not want an equivalent for the
Greek &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8055;&#945;. For this is expressed word for word by <i>essentia</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
Consequently, to that nature which supremely is, and which
created all else that exists, no nature is contrary save that
which does not exist. For nonentity is the contrary of that
which is. And thus there is no being contrary to God, the
Supreme Being, and Author of all beings whatsoever.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>That the enemies of God are so, not by nature but by will, which, as it injures
them, injures a good nature; for if vice does not injure, it is not vice.</i></p>

<p>In Scripture they are called God's enemies who oppose His
rule, not by nature, but by vice; having no power to hurt
Him, but only themselves. For they are His enemies, not
through their power to hurt, but by their will to oppose Him.
For God is unchangeable, and wholly proof against injury.
Therefore the vice which makes those who are called His
enemies resist Him, is an evil not to God, but to themselves.
And to them it is an evil, solely because it corrupts the good
of their nature. It is not nature, therefore, but vice, which is
contrary to God. For that which is evil is contrary to the
good. And who will deny that God is the supreme good?
Vice, therefore, is contrary to God, as evil to good. Further,
the nature it vitiates is a good, and therefore to this good
also it is contrary. But while it is contrary to God only as
evil to good, it is contrary to the nature it vitiates, both as
evil and as hurtful. For to God no evils are hurtful; but
only to natures mutable and corruptible, though, by the testimony
of the vices themselves, originally good. For were they
not good, vices could not hurt them. For how do they hurt
them but by depriving them of integrity, beauty, welfare,
virtue, and, in short, whatever natural good vice is wont to
diminish or destroy? But if there be no good to take away,
then no injury can be done, and consequently there can be no
vice. For it is impossible that there should be a harmless
vice. Whence we gather, that though vice cannot injure the
unchangeable good, it can injure nothing but good; because
it does not exist where it does not injure. This, then, may
be thus formulated: Vice cannot be in the highest good, and
cannot be but in some good. Things solely good, therefore,
can in some circumstances exist; things solely evil, never; for
even those natures which are vitiated by an evil will, so far
indeed as they are vitiated, are evil, but in so far as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
are natures they are good. And when a vitiated nature is
punished, besides the good it has in being a nature, it has
this also, that it is not unpunished.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> For this is just, and
certainly everything just is a good. For no one is punished
for natural, but for voluntary vices. For even the vice which
by the force of habit and long continuance has become a
second nature, had its origin in the will. For at present we
are speaking of the vices of the nature, which has a mental
capacity for that enlightenment which discriminates between
what is just and what is unjust.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the nature of irrational and lifeless creatures, which in their own kind
and order do not mar the beauty of the universe.</i></p>

<p>But it is ridiculous to condemn the faults of beasts and
trees, and other such mortal and mutable things as are void of
intelligence, sensation, or life, even though these faults should
destroy their corruptible nature; for these creatures received,
at their Creator's will, an existence fitting them, by passing
away and giving place to others, to secure that lowest form of
beauty, the beauty of seasons, which in its own place is a
requisite part of this world. For things earthly were neither
to be made equal to things heavenly, nor were they, though
inferior, to be quite omitted from the universe. Since, then,
in those situations where such things are appropriate, some
perish to make way for others that are born in their room,
and the less succumb to the greater, and the things that are
overcome are transformed into the quality of those that have
the mastery, this is the appointed order of things transitory.
Of this order the beauty does not strike us, because by our
mortal frailty we are so involved in a part of it, that we cannot
perceive the whole, in which these fragments that offend
us are harmonized with the most accurate fitness and beauty.
And therefore, where we are not so well able to perceive the
wisdom of the Creator, we are very properly enjoined to believe
it, lest in the vanity of human rashness we presume to find
any fault with the work of so great an Artificer. At the same
time, if we attentively consider even these faults of earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
things, which are neither voluntary nor penal, they seem to
illustrate the excellence of the natures themselves, which are
all originated and created by God; for it is that which pleases
us in this nature which we are displeased to see removed by
the fault,&mdash;unless even the natures themselves displease men,
as often happens when they become hurtful to them, and then
men estimate them not by their nature, but by their utility;
as in the case of those animals whose swarms scourged the
pride of the Egyptians. But in this way of estimating, they
may find fault with the sun itself; for certain criminals or
debtors are sentenced by the judges to be set in the sun.
Therefore it is not with respect to our convenience or discomfort,
but with respect to their own nature, that the creatures
are glorifying to their Artificer. Thus even the nature of the
eternal fire, penal though it be to the condemned sinners, is
most assuredly worthy of praise. For what is more beautiful
than fire flaming, blazing, and shining? What more useful
than fire for warming, restoring, cooking, though nothing is
more destructive than fire burning and consuming? The same
thing, then, when applied in one way, is destructive, but when
applied suitably, is most beneficial. For who can find words
to tell its uses throughout the whole world? We must
not listen, then, to those who praise the light of fire but find
fault with its heat, judging it not by its nature, but by their
convenience or discomfort. For they wish to see, but not
to be burnt. But they forget that this very light which is so
pleasant to them, disagrees with and hurts weak eyes; and
in that heat which is disagreeable to them, some animals
find the most suitable conditions of a healthy life.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>That in all natures, of every kind and rank, God is glorified.</i></p>

<p>All natures, then, inasmuch as they are, and have therefore
a rank and species of their own, and a kind of internal harmony,
are certainly good. And when they are in the places
assigned to them by the order of their nature, they preserve
such being as they have received. And those things which
have not received everlasting being, are altered for better or
for worse, so as to suit the wants and motions of those things
to which the Creator's law has made them subservient; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
thus they tend in the divine providence to that end which is
embraced in the general scheme of the government of the
universe. So that, though the corruption of transitory and
perishable things brings them to utter destruction, it does not
prevent their producing that which was designed to be their
result. And this being so, God, who supremely is, and who
therefore created every being which has not supreme existence
(for that which was made of nothing could not be equal to
Him, and indeed could not be at all had He not made it), is
not to be found fault with on account of the creature's faults,
but is to be praised in view of the natures He has made.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>What the cause of the blessedness of the good angels is, and what the
cause of the misery of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>Thus the true cause of the blessedness of the good angels
is found to be this, that they cleave to Him who supremely
is. And if we ask the cause of the misery of the bad, it
occurs to us, and not unreasonably, that they are miserable
because they have forsaken Him who supremely is, and have
turned to themselves who have no such essence. And this
vice, what else is it called than pride? For "pride is the
beginning of sin."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> They were unwilling, then, to preserve
their strength for God; and as adherence to God was the
condition of their enjoying an ampler being, they diminished
it by preferring themselves to Him. This was the first defect,
and the first impoverishment, and the first flaw of their nature,
which was created, not indeed supremely existent, but finding
its blessedness in the enjoyment of the Supreme Being; whilst
by abandoning Him it should become, not indeed no nature
at all, but a nature with a less ample existence, and therefore
wretched.</p>

<p>If the further question be asked, What was the efficient
cause of their evil will? there is none. For what is it which
makes the will bad, when it is the will itself which makes the
action bad? And consequently the bad will is the cause of
the bad action, but nothing is the efficient cause of the bad
will. For if anything is the cause, this thing either has or
has not a will. If it has, the will is either good or bad. If
good, who is so left to himself as to say that a good will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
makes a will bad? For in this case a good will would be
the cause of sin; a most absurd supposition. On the other
hand, if this hypothetical thing has a bad will, I wish to know
what made it so; and that we may not go on for ever, I ask
at once, what made the <i>first</i> evil will bad? For that is not
the first which was itself corrupted by an evil will, but that
is the first which was made evil by no other will. For if it
were preceded by that which made it evil, that will was first
which made the other evil. But if it is replied, "Nothing
made it evil; it always was evil," I ask if it has been existing
in some nature. For if not, then it did not exist at all;
and if it did exist in some nature, then it vitiated and corrupted
it, and injured it, and consequently deprived it of good.
And therefore the evil will could not exist in an evil nature,
but in a nature at once good and mutable, which this vice
could injure. For if it did no injury, it was no vice; and consequently
the will in which it was, could not be called evil.
But if it did injury, it did it by taking away or diminishing
good. And therefore there could not be from eternity, as was
suggested, an evil will in that thing in which there had been
previously a natural good, which the evil will was able to
diminish by corrupting it. If, then, it was not from eternity,
who, I ask, made it? The only thing that can be suggested
in reply is, that something which itself had no will, made the
will evil. I ask, then, whether this thing was superior, inferior,
or equal to it? If superior, then it is better. How,
then, has it no will, and not rather a good will? The same
reasoning applies if it was equal; for so long as two things
have equally a good will, the one cannot produce in the other
an evil will. Then remains the supposition that that which
corrupted the will of the angelic nature which first sinned,
was itself an inferior thing without a will. But that thing,
be it of the lowest and most earthly kind, is certainly itself
good, since it is a nature and being, with a form and rank of
its own in its own kind and order. How, then, can a good
thing be the efficient cause of an evil will? How, I say, can
good be the cause of evil? For when the will abandons what
is above itself, and turns to what is lower, it becomes evil&mdash;not
because that is evil to which it turns, but because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
turning itself is wicked. Therefore it is not an inferior thing
which has made the will evil, but it is itself which has become
so by wickedly and inordinately desiring an inferior thing.
For if two men, alike in physical and moral constitution, see
the same corporal beauty, and one of them is excited by the
sight to desire an illicit enjoyment, while the other stedfastly
maintains a modest restraint of his will, what do we suppose
brings it about, that there is an evil will in the one and not
in the other? What produces it in the man in whom it
exists? Not the bodily beauty, for that was presented equally
to the gaze of both, and yet did not produce in both an evil
will. Did the flesh of the one cause the desire as he looked?
But why did not the flesh of the other? Or was it the disposition?
But why not the disposition of both? For we
are supposing that both were of a like temperament of body
and soul. Must we, then, say that the one was tempted by a
secret suggestion of the evil spirit? As if it was not by his
own will that he consented to this suggestion and to any inducement
whatever! This consent, then, this evil will which
he presented to the evil suasive influence,&mdash;what was the
cause of it, we ask? For, not to delay on such a difficulty
as this, if both are tempted equally, and one yields and consents
to the temptation, while the other remains unmoved by
it, what other account can we give of the matter than this,
that the one is willing, the other unwilling, to fall away from
chastity? And what causes this but their own wills, in cases
at least such as we are supposing, where the temperament
is identical? The same beauty was equally obvious to the
eyes of both; the same secret temptation pressed on both
with equal violence. However minutely we examine the case,
therefore, we can discern nothing which caused the will of the
one to be evil. For if we say that the man himself made his
will evil, what was the man himself before his will was evil
but a good nature created by God, the unchangeable good?
Here are two men who, before the temptation, were alike in
body and soul, and of whom one yielded to the tempter who
persuaded him, while the other could not be persuaded to
desire that lovely body which was equally before the eyes of
both. Shall we say of the successfully tempted man that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
corrupted his own will, since he was certainly good before
his will became bad? Then, why did he do so? Was it
because his will was a nature, or because it was made of
nothing? We shall find that the latter is the case. For if
a nature is the cause of an evil will, what else can we say
than that evil arises from good, or that good is the cause of
evil? And how can it come to pass that a nature, good though
mutable, should produce any evil&mdash;that is to say, should make
the will itself wicked?</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That we ought not to expect to find any efficient cause of the evil will.</i></p>

<p>Let no one, therefore, look for an efficient cause of the evil
will; for it is not efficient, but deficient, as the will itself is
not an effecting of something, but a defect. For defection
from that which supremely is, to that which has less of being,&mdash;this
is to begin to have an evil will. Now, to seek to
discover the causes of these defections,&mdash;causes, as I have
said, not efficient, but deficient,&mdash;is as if some one sought to
see darkness, or hear silence. Yet both of these are known
by us, and the former by means only of the eye, the latter
only by the ear; but not by their positive actuality,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> but by
their want of it. Let no one, then, seek to know from me
what I know that I do not know; unless he perhaps wishes
to learn to be ignorant of that of which all we know is, that
it cannot be known. For those things which are known not
by their actuality, but by their want of it, are known, if our
expression may be allowed and understood, by not knowing
them, that by knowing them they may be not known. For
when the eyesight surveys objects that strike the sense, it
nowhere sees darkness but where it begins not to see. And
so no other sense but the ear can perceive silence, and yet it
is only perceived by not hearing. Thus, too, our mind perceives
intelligible forms by understanding them; but when
they are deficient, it knows them by not knowing them; for
"who can understand defects?"<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of the misdirected love whereby the will fell away from the immutable
to the mutable good.</i></p>

<p>This I do know, that the nature of God can never, nowhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
nowise be defective, and that natures made of nothing
can. These latter, however, the more being they have, and
the more good they do (for then they do something positive),
the more they have efficient causes; but in so far as they are
defective in being, and consequently do evil (for then what is
their work but vanity?), they have deficient causes. And I
know likewise, that the will could not become evil, were it
unwilling to become so; and therefore its failings are justly
punished, being not necessary, but voluntary. For its defections
are not to evil things, but are themselves evil; that is
to say, are not towards things that are naturally and in themselves
evil, but the defection of the will is evil, because it is
contrary to the order of nature, and an abandonment of that
which has supreme being for that which has less. For avarice
is not a fault inherent in gold, but in the man who inordinately
loves gold, to the detriment of justice, which ought to
be held in incomparably higher regard than gold. Neither is
luxury the fault of lovely and charming objects, but of the
heart that inordinately loves sensual pleasures, to the neglect
of temperance, which attaches us to objects more lovely in
their spirituality, and more delectable by their incorruptibility.
Nor yet is boasting the fault of human praise, but of the soul
that is inordinately fond of the applause of men, and that
makes light of the voice of conscience. Pride, too, is not the
fault of him who delegates power, nor of power itself, but of
the soul that is inordinately enamoured of its own power, and
despises the more just dominion of a higher authority. Consequently
he who inordinately loves the good which any
nature possesses, even though he obtain it, himself becomes
evil in the good, and wretched because deprived of a greater
good.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether the angels, besides receiving from God their nature, received from
Him also their good will by the Holy Spirit imbuing them with love.</i></p>

<p>There is, then, no natural efficient cause, or, if I may be
allowed the expression, no essential cause, of the evil will,
since itself is the origin of evil in mutable spirits, by which
the good of their nature is diminished and corrupted; and
the will is made evil by nothing else than defection from
God,&mdash;a defection of which the cause, too, is certainly deficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
But as to the good will, if we should say that there
is no efficient cause of it, we must beware of giving currency
to the opinion that the good will of the good angels is not
created, but is co-eternal with God. For if they themselves
are created, how can we say that their good will was eternal?
But if created, was it created along with themselves, or did
they exist for a time without it? If along with themselves,
then doubtless it was created by Him who created them, and,
as soon as ever they were created, they attached themselves
to Him who created them, with the love He created in them.
And they are separated from the society of the rest, because
they have continued in the same good will; while the others
have fallen away to another will, which is an evil one, by the
very fact of its being a falling away from the good; from
which, we may add, they would not have fallen away had
they been unwilling to do so. But if the good angels existed
for a time without a good will, and produced it in themselves
without God's interference, then it follows that they made
themselves better than He made them. Away with such a
thought! For without a good will, what were they but evil?
Or if they were not evil, because they had not an evil will
any more than a good one (for they had not fallen away from
that which as yet they had not begun to enjoy), certainly they
were not the same, not so good, as when they came to have
a good will. Or if they could not make themselves better
than they were made by Him who is surpassed by none in
His work, then certainly, without His helpful operation,
they could not come to possess that good will which made
them better. And though their good will effected that they
did not turn to themselves, who had a more stinted existence,
but to Him who supremely is, and that, being united to Him,
their own being was enlarged, and they lived a wise and
blessed life by His communications to them, what does this
prove but that the will, however good it might be, would
have continued helplessly only to desire Him, had not He
who had made their nature out of nothing, and yet capable of
enjoying Him, first stimulated it to desire Him, and then
filled it with Himself, and so made it better?</p>

<p>Besides, this too has to be inquired into, whether, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
good angels made their own will good, they did so with or
without will? If without, then it was not their doing. If
with, was the will good or bad? If bad, how could a bad
will give birth to a good one? If good, then already they had
a good will. And who made this will, which already they
had, but He who created them with a good will, or with that
chaste love by which they cleaved to Him, in one and the
same act creating their nature, and endowing it with grace?
And thus we are driven to believe that the holy angels never
existed without a good will or the love of God. But the
angels who, though created good, are yet evil now, became so
by their own will. And this will was not made evil by their
good nature, unless by its voluntary defection from good;
for good is not the cause of evil, but a defection from good
is. These angels, therefore, either received less of the grace
of the divine love than those who persevered in the same; or
if both were created equally good, then, while the one fell by
their evil will, the others were more abundantly assisted, and
attained to that pitch of blessedness at which they became
certain they should never fall from it,&mdash;as we have already
shown in the preceding book.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> We must therefore acknowledge,
with the praise due to the Creator, that not only of
holy men, but also of the holy angels, it can be said that
"the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy
Ghost, which is given unto them."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> And that not only of
men, but primarily and principally of angels it is true, as it
is written, "It is good to draw near to God."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> And those
who have this good in common, have, both with Him to
whom they draw near, and with one another, a holy fellowship,
and form one city of God&mdash;His living sacrifice, and His
living temple. And I see that, as I have now spoken of the
rise of this city among the angels, it is time to speak of the
origin of that part of it which is hereafter to be united to the
immortal angels, and which at present is being gathered from
among mortal men, and is either sojourning on earth, or, in
the persons of those who have passed through death, is resting
in the secret receptacles and abodes of disembodied spirits.
For from one man, whom God created as the first, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
human race descended, according to the faith of Holy Scripture,
which deservedly is of wonderful authority among all
nations throughout the world; since, among its other true
statements, it predicted, by its divine foresight, that all nations
would give credit to it.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the falseness of the history which allots many thousand years to the
world's past.</i></p>

<p>Let us, then, omit the conjectures of men who know not
what they say, when they speak of the nature and origin of
the human race. For some hold the same opinion regarding
men that they hold regarding the world itself, that they have
always been. Thus Apuleius says when he is describing our
race, "Individually they are mortal, but collectively, and as
a race, they are immortal."<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> And when they are asked, how,
if the human race has always been, they vindicate the truth
of their history, which narrates who were the inventors, and
what they invented, and who first instituted the liberal studies
and the other arts, and who first inhabited this or that region,
and this or that island? they reply<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> that most, if not all
lands, were so desolated at intervals by fire and flood, that
men were greatly reduced in numbers, and from these, again,
the population was restored to its former numbers, and that
thus there was at intervals a new beginning made, and though
those things which had been interrupted and checked by the
severe devastations were only renewed, yet they seemed to be
originated then, but that man could not exist at all save as
produced by man. But they say what they think, not what
they know.</p>

<p>They are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents
which profess to give the history of many thousand
years, though, reckoning by the sacred writings, we find that
not 6000 years have yet passed.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> And, not to spend many
words in exposing the baselessness of these documents, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
which so many thousands of years are accounted for, nor
in proving that their authorities are totally inadequate, let
me cite only that letter which Alexander the Great wrote to
his mother Olympias,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> giving her the narrative he had from
an Egyptian priest, which he had extracted from their sacred
archives, and which gave an account of kingdoms mentioned
also by the Greek historians. In this letter of Alexander's a
term of upwards of 5000 years is assigned to the kingdom of
Assyria; while in the Greek history only 1300 years are
reckoned from the reign of Bel himself, whom both Greek
and Egyptian agree in counting the first king of Assyria.
Then to the empire of the Persians and Macedonians this
Egyptian assigned more than 8000 years, counting to the
time of Alexander, to whom he was speaking; while among
the Greeks, 485 years are assigned to the Macedonians down
to the death of Alexander, and to the Persians 233 years,
reckoning to the termination of his conquests. Thus these
give a much smaller number of years than the Egyptians;
and indeed, though multiplied three times, the Greek chronology
would still be shorter. For the Egyptians are said to
have formerly reckoned only four months to their year;<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> so
that one year, according to the fuller and truer computation
now in use among them as well as among ourselves, would
comprehend three of their old years. But not even thus, as I
said, does the Greek history correspond with the Egyptian in
its chronology. And therefore the former must receive the
greater credit, because it does not exceed the true account of
the duration of the world as it is given by our documents,
which are truly sacred. Further, if this letter of Alexander,
which has become so famous, differs widely in this matter of
chronology from the probable credible account, how much

<p class="center">12. <i>How these persons are to be answered, who find fault with the creation of
man on the score of its recent date.</i></p>

<p>As to those who are always asking why man was not
created during these countless ages of the infinitely extended
past, and came into being so lately that, according to Scripture,
less than 6000 years have elapsed since he began to be, I
would reply to them regarding the creation of man, just as I
replied regarding the origin of the world to those who will
not believe that it is not eternal, but had a beginning, which
even Plato himself most plainly declares, though some think
his statement was not consistent with his real opinion.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
offends them that the time that has elapsed since the creation
of man is so short, and his years so few according to our
authorities, let them take this into consideration, that nothing
that has a limit is long, and that all the ages of time being
finite, are very little, or indeed nothing at all, when compared
to the interminable eternity. Consequently, if there had
elapsed since the creation of man, I do not say five or six, but
even sixty or six hundred thousand years, or sixty times as
many, or six hundred or six hundred thousand times as many,
or this sum multiplied until it could no longer be expressed
in numbers, the same question could still be put, Why was
he not made before? For the past and boundless eternity
during which God abstained from creating man is so great,
that, compare it with what vast and untold number of ages
you please, so long as there is a definite conclusion of this
term of time, it is not even as if you compared the minutest
drop of water with the ocean that everywhere flows around
the globe. For of these two, one indeed is very small, the
other incomparably vast, yet both are finite; but that space of
time which starts from some beginning, and is limited by some
termination, be it of what extent it may, if you compare
it with that which has no beginning, I know not whether to
say we should count it the very minutest thing, or nothing at
all. For, take this limited time, and deduct from the end of it,
one by one, the briefest moments (as you might take day by day
from a man's life, beginning at the day in which he now lives,
back to that of his birth), and though the number of moments
you must subtract in this backward movement be so great
that no word can express it, yet this subtraction will some
time carry you to the beginning. But if you take away from
a time which has no beginning, I do not say brief moments
one by one, nor yet hours, or days, or months, or years even
in quantities, but terms of years so vast that they cannot be
named by the most skilful arithmetician,&mdash;take away terms of
years as vast as that which we have supposed to be gradually
consumed by the deduction of moments,&mdash;and take them away
not once and again repeatedly, but always, and what do you
effect, what do you make by your deduction, since you never
reach the beginning which has no existence? Wherefore, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
which we now demand after five thousand odd years, our
descendants might with like curiosity demand after six hundred
thousand years, supposing these dying generations of men
continue so long to decay and be renewed, and supposing posterity
continues as weak and ignorant as ourselves. The same
question might have been asked by those who have lived before
us, and while man was even newer upon earth. The first man
himself, in short, might, the day after, or the very day of his
creation, have asked why he was created no sooner. And no
matter at what earlier or later period he had been created, this
controversy about the commencement of this world's history
would have had precisely the same difficulties as it has now.</p>

<p>13. <i>Of the revolution of the ages, which some philosophers believe will bring all
things round again, after a certain fixed cycle, to the same order and
form as at first.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This controversy some philosophers have seen no other
approved means of solving than by introducing cycles of time,
in which there should be a constant renewal and repetition of
the order of nature;<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and they have therefore asserted that
these cycles will ceaselessly recur, one passing away and another
coming, though they are not agreed as to whether one permanent
world shall pass through all these cycles, or whether
the world shall at fixed intervals die out, and be renewed so
as to exhibit a recurrence of the same phenomena&mdash;the things
which have been, and those which are to be, coinciding. And
from this fantastic vicissitude they exempt not even the immortal
soul that has attained wisdom, consigning it to a ceaseless
transmigration between delusive blessedness and real
misery. For how can that be truly called blessed which has
no assurance of being so eternally, and is either in ignorance
of the truth, and blind to the misery that is approaching, or,
knowing it, is in misery and fear? Or if it passes to bliss,
and leaves miseries for ever, then there happens in time a
new thing which time shall not end. Why not, then, the
world also? Why may not man, too, be a similar thing?
So that, by following the straight path of sound doctrine, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
escape, I know not what circuitous paths, discovered by deceiving
and deceived sages.</p>

<p>Some, too, in advocating these recurring cycles that restore
all things to their original, cite in favour of their supposition
what Solomon says in the book of Ecclesiastes: "What is that
which hath been? It is that which shall be. And what is
that which is done? It is that which shall be done: and
there is no new thing under the sun. Who can speak and
say, See, this is new? It hath been already of old time, which
was before us."<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> This he said either of those things of which he
had just been speaking&mdash;the succession of generations, the orbit
of the sun, the course of rivers,&mdash;or else of all kinds of creatures
that are born and die. For men were before us, are with us,
and shall be after us; and so all living things and all plants.
Even monstrous and irregular productions, though differing
from one another, and though some are reported as solitary
instances, yet resemble one another generally, in so far as they
are miraculous and monstrous, and, in this sense, have been,
and shall be, and are no new and recent things under the
sun. However, some would understand these words as meaning
that in the predestination of God all things have already
existed, and that thus there is no new thing under the sun.
At all events, far be it from any true believer to suppose
that by these words of Solomon those cycles are meant, in
which, according to those philosophers, the same periods
and events of time are repeated; as if, for example, the
philosopher Plato, having taught in the school at Athens
which is called the Academy, so, numberless ages before,
at long but certain intervals, this same Plato, and the same
school, and the same disciples existed, and so also are to be
repeated during the countless cycles that are yet be be,&mdash;far
be it, I say, from us to believe this. For once Christ died
for our sins; and, rising from the dead, He dieth no more.
"Death hath no more dominion over Him;"<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and we ourselves
after the resurrection shall be "ever with the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> to whom
we now say, as the sacred Psalmist dictates, "Thou shalt keep
us, O Lord, Thou shalt preserve us from this generation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
And that too which follows, is, I think, appropriate enough:
"The wicked walk <i>in a circle</i>;" not because their life is to
recur by means of these circles, which these philosophers
imagine, but because the path in which their false doctrine
now runs is circuitous.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the creation of the human race in time, and how this was effected
without any new design or change of purpose on God's part.</i></p>

<p>What wonder is it if, entangled in these circles, they find
neither entrance nor egress? For they know not how the
human race, and this mortal condition of ours, took its origin,
nor how it will be brought to an end, since they cannot
penetrate the inscrutable wisdom of God. For, though Himself
eternal, and without beginning, yet He caused time to have a
beginning; and man, whom He had not previously made, He
made in time, not from a new and sudden resolution, but by
His unchangeable and eternal design. Who can search out
the unsearchable depth of this purpose, who can scrutinize the
inscrutable wisdom, wherewith God, without change of will,
created man, who had never before been, and gave him an
existence in time, and increased the human race from one
individual? For the Psalmist himself, when he had first
said, "Thou shalt keep us, O Lord, Thou shalt preserve us
from this generation for ever," and had then rebuked those
whose foolish and impious doctrine preserves for the soul no
eternal deliverance and blessedness, adds immediately, "The
wicked walk in a circle." Then, as if it were said to him,
"What then do you believe, feel, know? Are we to believe
that it suddenly occurred to God to create man, whom He
had never before made in a past eternity,&mdash;God, to whom
nothing new can occur, and in whom is no changeableness?"
the Psalmist goes on to reply, as if addressing God Himself,
"According to the depth of Thy wisdom Thou hast multiplied
the children of men." Let men, he seems to say, fancy what
they please, let them conjecture and dispute as seems good to
them, but Thou hast multiplied the children of men according
to the depth of thy wisdom, which no man can comprehend.
For this is a depth indeed, that God always has been, and that
man, whom He had never made before, He willed to make in
time, and this without changing His design and will.</p>

<p>For my own part, indeed, as I dare not say that there ever

created in time. But when I consider what God could be the

that it is written, "What man is he that can know the
counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord
is? For the thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our
devices are but uncertain. For the corruptible body presseth

do I muse upon in this earthly tabernacle, because the one thing
which is true among the many, or beyond the many, I cannot

have always been creatures for Him to be Lord of, who is
always and ever has been Lord, but that these creatures have
not always been the same, but succeeded one another (for we
would not seem to say that any is co-eternal with the Creator,
an assertion condemned equally by faith and sound reason), I
must take care lest I fall into the absurd and ignorant error
of maintaining that by these successions and changes mortal
creatures have always existed, whereas the immortal creatures
had not begun to exist until the date of our own world, when
the angels were created; if at least the angels are intended
by that light which was first made, or, rather, by that heaven
of which it is said, "In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The angels at least did not exist before
they were created; for if we say that they have always
existed, we shall seem to make them co-eternal with the
Creator. Again, if I say that the angels were not created in
time, but existed before all times, as those over whom God,
who has ever been Sovereign, exercised His sovereignty, then
I shall be asked whether, if they were created before all time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
they, being creatures, could possibly always exist. It may
perhaps be replied, Why not <i>always</i>, since that which is in
all time may very properly be said to be "always?" Now,
so true is it that these angels have existed in all time, that
even before time was, they were created; if at least time
began with the heavens, and the angels existed before the
heavens. And if time was even before the heavenly bodies, not
indeed marked by hours, days, months, and years,&mdash;for these
measures of time's periods which are commonly and properly
called times, did manifestly begin with the motion of the
heavenly bodies, and so God said, when He appointed them,
"Let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for
years,"<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>&mdash;if, I say, time was before these heavenly bodies by some
changing movement, whose parts succeeded one another and
could not exist simultaneously, and if there was some such
movement among the angels which necessitated the existence
of time, and that they from their very creation should be subject
to these temporal changes, then they have existed in all
time, for time came into being along with them. And who
will say that what was in all time, was not always?</p>

<p>But if I make such a reply, it will be said to me, How, then,
are they not co-eternal with the Creator, if He and they
always have been? How even can they be said to have
been created, if we are to understand that they have always
existed? What shall we reply to this? Shall we say that
both statements are true? that they always have been, since
they have been in all time, they being created along with
time, or time along with them, and yet that also they were
created? For, similarly, we will not deny that time itself
was created, though no one doubts that time has been in all
time; for if it has not been in all time, then there was a time
when there was no time. But the most foolish person could
not make such an assertion. For we can reasonably say
there was a time when Rome was not; there was a time
when Jerusalem was not; there was a time when Abraham
was not; there was a time when man was not, and so on:
in fine, if the world was not made at the commencement
of time, but after some time had elapsed, we can say there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
was a time when the world was not. But to say there
was a time when time was not, is as absurd as to say
there was a man when there was no man; or, this world was
when this world was not. For if we are not referring to
the same object, the form of expression may be used, as, there
was another man when this man was not. Thus we can
reasonably say there was another time when this time was
not; but not the merest simpleton could say there was a
time when there was no time. As, then, we say that time
was created, though we also say that it always has been,
since in all time time has been, so it does not follow that if
the angels have always been, they were therefore not created.
For we say that they have always been, because they have
been in all time; and we say they have been in all time,
because time itself could no wise be without them. For
where there is no creature whose changing movements admit
of succession, there cannot be time at all. And consequently,
even if they have always existed, they were created; neither,
if they have always existed, are they therefore co-eternal with
the Creator. For He has always existed in unchangeable
eternity; while they were created, and are said to have been
always, because they have been in all time, time being impossible
without the creature. But time passing away by its
changefulness, cannot be co-eternal with changeless eternity.
And consequently, though the immortality of the angels does
not pass in time, does not become past as if now it were not,
nor has a future as if it were not yet, still their movements,
which are the basis of time, do pass from future to past; and
therefore they cannot be co-eternal with the Creator, in whose
movement we cannot say that there has been that which now
is not, or shall be that which is not yet. Wherefore, if God
always has been Lord, He has always had creatures under His
dominion,&mdash;creatures, however, not begotten of Him, but created
by Him out of nothing; nor co-eternal with Him, for He was
before them, though at no time without them, because He
preceded them, not by the lapse of time, but by His abiding
eternity. But if I make this reply to those who demand
how He was always Creator, always Lord, if there were not
always a subject creation; or how this was created, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
rather co-eternal with its Creator, if it always was, I fear I
may be accused of recklessly affirming what I know not,
instead of teaching what I know. I return, therefore, to that
which our Creator has seen fit that we should know; and those
things which He has allowed the abler men to know in this
life, or has reserved to be known in the next by the perfected
saints, I acknowledge to be beyond my capacity. But I have
thought it right to discuss these matters without making
positive assertions, that they who read may be warned to abstain
from hazardous questions, and may not deem themselves
fit for everything. Let them rather endeavour to obey the
wholesome injunction of the apostle, when he says, "For I
say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought
to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt
to every man the measure of faith."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> For if an infant receive

<p class="center">16. <i>How we are to understand God's promise of life eternal, which was
uttered before the "eternal times."</i></p>

<p>I own that I do not know what ages passed before the
human race was created, yet I have no doubt that no created
thing is co-eternal with the Creator. But even the apostle
speaks of time as eternal, and this with reference, not to the
future, but, which is more surprising, to the past. For he
says, "In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised
before the eternal times, but hath in due times manifested
His word."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> You see he says that in the past there
have been eternal times, which, however, were not co-eternal
with God. And since God before these eternal times not
only existed, but also "promised" life eternal, which He
manifested in its own times (that is to say, in due times),
what else is this than His word? For this is life eternal.
But then, how did He promise; for the promise was made to
men, and yet they had no existence before eternal times?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
Does this not mean that, in His own eternity, and in His
co-eternal word, that which was to be in its own time was
already predestined and fixed?</p>

<p>17. <i>What defence is made by sound faith regarding God's unchangeable counsel
and will, against the reasonings of those who hold that the works of God
are eternally repeated in revolving cycles that restore all things as they were.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Of this, too, I have no doubt, that before the first man was
created, there never had been a man at all, neither this same
man himself recurring by I know not what cycles, and having
made I know not how many revolutions, nor any other of
similar nature. From this belief I am not frightened by
philosophical arguments, among which that is reckoned the
most acute which is founded on the assertion that the infinite
cannot be comprehended by any mode of knowledge. Consequently,
they argue, God has in His own mind finite conceptions
of all finite things which He makes. Now it cannot
be supposed that His goodness was ever idle; for if it were,
there should be ascribed to Him an awakening to activity in
time, from a past eternity of inactivity, as if He repented of
an idleness that had no beginning, and proceeded, therefore, to
make a beginning of work. This being the case, they say it
must be that the same things are always repeated, and that
as they pass, so they are destined always to return, whether
amidst all these changes the world remains the same,&mdash;the
world which has always been, and yet was created,&mdash;or that
the world in these revolutions is perpetually dying out and
being renewed; otherwise, if we point to a time when the
works of God were begun, it would be believed that He considered
His past eternal leisure to be inert and indolent, and
therefore condemned and altered it as displeasing to Himself.
Now if God is supposed to have been indeed always making
temporal things, but different from one another, and one after
the other, so that He thus came at last to make man, whom
He had never made before, then it may seem that He made
man not with knowledge (for they suppose no knowledge can
comprehend the infinite succession of creatures), but at the
dictate of the hour, as it struck Him at the moment, with a
sudden and accidental change of mind. On the other hand,
say they, if those cycles be admitted, and if we suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
the same temporal things are repeated, while the world either
remains identical through all these rotations, or else dies away
and is renewed, then there is ascribed to God neither the
slothful ease of a past eternity, nor a rash and unforeseen
creation. And if the same things be not thus repeated in
cycles, then they cannot by any science or prescience be comprehended
in their endless diversity. Even though reason
could not refute, faith would smile at these argumentations,
with which the godless endeavour to turn our simple piety
from the right way, that we may walk with them "in a circle."
But by the help of the Lord our God, even reason, and that
readily enough, shatters these revolving circles which conjecture
frames. For that which specially leads these men
astray to prefer their own circles to the straight path of
truth, is, that they measure by their own human, changeable,
and narrow intellect the divine mind, which is absolutely
unchangeable, infinitely capacious, and, without succession of
thought, counting all things without number. So that saying
of the apostle comes true of them, for, "comparing themselves
with themselves, they do not understand."<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> For because they
do, in virtue of a new purpose, whatever new thing has occurred
to them to be done (their minds being changeable), they conclude
it is so with God; and thus compare, not God,&mdash;for they
cannot conceive God, but think of one like themselves when
they think of Him,&mdash;not God, but themselves, and not with
Him, but with themselves. For our part, we dare not believe
that God is affected in one way when He works, in another
when He rests. Indeed, to say that He is affected at all, is
an abuse of language, since it implies that there comes to be
something in His nature which was not there before. For he
who is affected is acted upon, and whatever is acted upon is
changeable. In His leisure, therefore, is no laziness, indolence,
inactivity; as in His work is no labour, effort, industry. He
can act while He reposes, and repose while He acts. He can
begin a new work with (not a new, but) an eternal design;
and what He has not made before, He does not now begin
to make because He repents of His former repose. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
when one speaks of His former repose and subsequent operation
(and I know not how men can understand these things),
this "former" and "subsequent" are applied only to the things
created, which formerly did not exist, and subsequently came
into existence. But in God the former purpose is not altered
and obliterated by the subsequent and different purpose, but
by one and the same eternal and unchangeable will He effected
regarding the things He created, both that formerly, so long
as they were not, they should not be, and that subsequently,
when they began to be, they should come into existence.
And thus, perhaps, He would show in a very striking way, to
those who have eyes for such things, how independent He is
of what He makes, and how it is of His own gratuitous goodness

<p class="center">18. <i>Against those who assert that things that are infinite</i><a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> <i>cannot be
comprehended by the knowledge of God.</i></p>

<p>As for their other assertion, that God's knowledge cannot
comprehend things infinite, it only remains for them to affirm,
in order that they may sound the depths of their impiety, that
God does not know all numbers. For it is very certain that
they are infinite; since, no matter at what number you suppose
an end to be made, this number can be, I will not say, increased
by the addition of one more, but however great it be,
and however vast be the multitude of which it is the rational
and scientific expression, it can still be not only doubled, but
even multiplied. Moreover, each number is so defined by its
own properties, that no two numbers are equal. They are
therefore both unequal and different from one another; and
while they are simply finite, collectively they are infinite.
Does God, therefore, not know numbers on account of this
infinity; and does His knowledge extend only to a certain
height in numbers, while of the rest He is ignorant? Who
is so left to himself as to say so? Yet they can hardly pretend
to put numbers out of the question, or maintain that they
have nothing to do with the knowledge of God; for Plato,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
their great authority, represents God as framing the world on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
numerical principles; and in our books also it is said to God,
"Thou hast ordered all things in number, and measure, and
weight."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The prophet also says, "Who bringeth out their host
by number."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> And the Saviour says in the Gospel, "The very
hairs of your head are all numbered."<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Far be it, then, from
us to doubt that all number is known to Him "whose understanding,"
according to the Psalmist, "is infinite."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The infinity
of number, though there be no numbering of infinite
numbers, is yet not incomprehensible by Him whose understanding
is infinite. And thus, if everything which is comprehended
is defined or made finite by the comprehension of
him who knows it, then all infinity is in some ineffable way
made finite to God, for it is comprehensible by His knowledge.
Wherefore, if the infinity of numbers cannot be infinite to the
knowledge of God, by which it is comprehended, what are we
poor creatures that we should presume to fix limits to His
knowledge, and say that unless the same temporal things be
repeated by the same periodic revolutions, God cannot either
foreknow His creatures that He may make them, or know
them when He has made them? God, whose knowledge is
simply manifold, and uniform in its variety, comprehends all
incomprehensibles with so incomprehensible a comprehension,
that though He willed always to make His later works novel
and unlike what went before them, He could not produce them
without order and foresight, nor conceive them suddenly, but
by His eternal foreknowledge.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of worlds without end, or ages of ages.</i><a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>I do not presume to determine whether God does so, and
whether these times which are called "ages of ages" are joined
together in a continuous series, and succeed one another with
a regulated diversity, and leave exempt from their vicissitudes
only those who are freed from their misery, and abide without
end in a blessed immortality; or whether these are called
"ages of ages," that we may understand that the ages remain
unchangeable in God's unwavering wisdom, and are the efficient
causes, as it were, of those ages which are being spent in time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
Possibly "ages" is used for "age," so that nothing else is
meant by "ages of ages" than by "age of age," as nothing
else is meant by "heavens of heavens" than by "heaven of
heaven." For God called the firmament, above which are the
waters, "Heaven," and yet the psalm says, "Let the waters that
are above the <i>heavens</i> praise the name of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Which
of these two meanings we are to attach to "ages of ages," or
whether there is not some other and better meaning still, is a
very profound question; and the subject we are at present
handling presents no obstacle to our meanwhile deferring the
discussion of it, whether we may be able to determine anything
about it, or may only be made more cautious by its
further treatment, so as to be deterred from making any rash
affirmations in a matter of such obscurity. For at present we
are disputing the opinion that affirms the existence of those
periodic revolutions by which the same things are always recurring
at intervals of time. Now, whichever of these suppositions
regarding the "ages of ages" be the true one, it avails
nothing for the substantiating of those cycles; for whether the
ages of ages be not a repetition of the same world, but different
worlds succeeding one another in a regulated connection,
the ransomed souls abiding in well-assured bliss without any
recurrence of misery, or whether the ages of ages be the eternal
causes which rule what shall be and is in time, it equally
follows, that those cycles which bring round the same things
have no existence; and nothing more thoroughly explodes them
than the fact of the eternal life of the saints.</p>

blessedness, must yet again and again in these periodic revolutions return

<p>What pious ears could bear to hear that after a life spent
in so many and severe distresses (if, indeed, that should be
called a life at all which is rather a death, so utter that the
love of this present death makes us fear that death which delivers
us from it), that after evils so disastrous, and miseries of
all kinds have at length been expiated and finished by the help
of true religion and wisdom, and when we have thus attained
to the vision of God, and have entered into bliss by the contemplation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
of spiritual light and participation in His unchangeable
immortality, which we burn to attain,&mdash;that we must at
some time lose all this, and that they who do lose it are cast
down from that eternity, truth, and felicity to infernal mortality
and shameful foolishness, and are involved in accursed
woes, in which God is lost, truth held in detestation, and happiness
sought in iniquitous impurities? and that this will
happen endlessly again and again, recurring at fixed intervals,
and in regularly returning periods? and that this everlasting
and ceaseless revolution of definite cycles, which remove and
restore true misery and deceitful bliss in turn, is contrived in
order that God may be able to know His own works, since on
the one hand He cannot rest from creating, and on the other,
cannot know the infinite number of His creatures, if He always
makes creatures? Who, I say, can listen to such things?
Who can accept or suffer them to be spoken? Were they true,
it were not only more prudent to keep silence regarding them,
but even (to express myself as best I can) it were the part of
wisdom not to know them. For if in the future world we
shall not remember these things, and by this oblivion be blessed,
why should we now increase our misery, already burdensome
enough, by the knowledge of them? If, on the other hand,
the knowledge of them will be forced upon us hereafter, now
at least let us remain in ignorance, that in the present expectation
we may enjoy a blessedness which the future reality is
not to bestow; since in this life we are expecting to obtain
life everlasting, but in the world to come are to discover it to
be blessed, but not everlasting.</p>

<p>And if they maintain that no one can attain to the blessedness
of the world to come, unless in this life he has been indoctrinated
in those cycles in which bliss and misery relieve
one another, how do they avow that the more a man loves God,
the more readily he attains to blessedness,&mdash;they who teach
what paralyzes love itself? For who would not be more remiss
and lukewarm in his love for a person whom he thinks
he shall be forced to abandon, and whose truth and wisdom he
shall come to hate; and this, too, after he has quite attained
to the utmost and most blissful knowledge of Him that he is
capable of? Can any one be faithful in his love, even to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
human friend, if he knows that he is destined to become his
enemy?<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> God forbid that there be any truth in an opinion
which threatens us with a real misery that is never to end, but
is often and endlessly to be interrupted by intervals of fallacious
happiness. For what happiness can be more fallacious and
false than that in whose blaze of truth we yet remain ignorant
that we shall be miserable, or in whose most secure citadel we
yet fear that we shall be so? For if, on the one hand, we are to
be ignorant of coming calamity, then our present misery is not so
shortsighted, for it is assured of coming bliss. If, on the other
hand, the disaster that threatens is not concealed from us in
the world to come, then the time of misery which is to be at
last exchanged for a state of blessedness, is spent by the soul
more happily than its time of happiness, which is to end in a
return to misery. And thus our expectation of unhappiness
is happy, but of happiness unhappy. And therefore, as we
here suffer present ills, and hereafter fear ills that are imminent,
it were truer to say that we shall always be miserable,
than that we can some time be happy.</p>

<p>But these things are declared to be false by the loud testimony
of religion and truth; for religion truthfully promises a
true blessedness, of which we shall be eternally assured, and
which cannot be interrupted by any disaster. Let us therefore
keep to the straight path, which is Christ, and, with Him
as our Guide and Saviour, let us turn away in heart and
mind from the unreal and futile cycles of the godless. Porphyry,
Platonist though he was, abjured the opinion of his
school, that in these cycles souls are ceaselessly passing away
and returning, either being struck with the extravagance of
the idea, or sobered by his knowledge of Christianity. As I
mentioned in the tenth book,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> he preferred saying that the
soul, as it had been sent into the world that it might know
evil, and be purged and delivered from it, was never again
exposed to such an experience after it had once returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
the Father. And if he abjured the tenets of his school, how
much more ought we Christians to abominate and avoid an
opinion so unfounded and hostile to our faith? But having
disposed of these cycles and escaped out of them, no necessity
compels us to suppose that the human race had no beginning
in time, on the ground that there is nothing new in
nature which, by I know not what cycles, has not at some
previous period existed, and is not hereafter to exist again.
For if the soul, once delivered, as it never was before, is never
to return to misery, then there happens in its experience something
which never happened before; and this, indeed, something
of the greatest consequence, to wit, the secure entrance
into eternal felicity. And if in an immortal nature there can
occur a novelty, which never has been, nor ever shall be, reproduced
by any cycle, why is it disputed that the same may
occur in mortal natures? If they maintain that blessedness
is no new experience to the soul, but only a return to that
state in which it has been eternally, then at least its deliverance
from misery is something new, since, by their own showing,
the misery from which it is delivered is itself, too, a new
experience. And if this new experience fell out by accident,
and was not embraced in the order of things appointed by
Divine Providence, then where are those determinate and
measured cycles in which no new thing happens, but all
things are reproduced as they were before? If, however, this
new experience was embraced in that providential order of
nature (whether the soul was exposed to the evil of this world
for the sake of discipline, or fell into it by sin), then it is
possible for new things to happen which never happened
before, and which yet are not extraneous to the order of
nature. And if the soul is able by its own imprudence to
create for itself a new misery, which was not unforeseen by the
Divine Providence, but was provided for in the order of nature
along with the deliverance from it, how can we, even with
all the rashness of human vanity, presume to deny that God
can create new things&mdash;new to the world, but not to Him&mdash;which
He never before created, but yet foresaw from all
eternity? If they say that it is indeed true that ransomed
souls return no more to misery, but that even so no new thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
happens, since there always have been, now are, and ever shall
be a succession of ransomed souls, they must at least grant
that in this case there are new souls to whom the misery and
the deliverance from it are new. For if they maintain that
those souls out of which new men are daily being made (from
whose bodies, if they have lived wisely, they are so delivered
that they never return to misery) are not new, but have
existed from eternity, they must logically admit that they are
infinite. For however great a finite number of souls there
were, that would not have sufficed to make perpetually new
men from eternity,&mdash;men whose souls were to be eternally
freed from this mortal state, and never afterwards to return to
it. And our philosophers will find it hard to explain how there
is an infinite number of souls in an order of nature which
they require shall be finite, that it may be known by God.</p>

<p>And now that we have exploded these cycles which were
supposed to bring back the soul at fixed periods to the same
miseries, what can seem more in accordance with godly reason
than to believe that it is possible for God both to create new
things never before created, and in doing so, to preserve His
will unaltered? But whether the number of eternally redeemed
souls can be continually increased or not, let the
philosophers themselves decide, who are so subtle in determining
where infinity cannot be admitted. For our own part,
our reasoning holds in either case. For if the number of
souls can be indefinitely increased, what reason is there to deny
that what had never before been created, could be created?
since the number of ransomed souls never existed before, and
has yet not only been once made, but will never cease to be
anew coming into being. If, on the other hand, it be more
suitable that the number of eternally ransomed souls be definite,
and that this number will never be increased, yet this number,
whatever it be, did assuredly never exist before, and it cannot
increase, and reach the amount it signifies, without having some
beginning; and this beginning never before existed. That this
beginning, therefore, might be, the first man was created.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>That there was created at first but one individual, and that the human
race was created in him.</i></p>

<p>Now that we have solved, as well as we could, this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
difficult question about the eternal God creating new things,
without any novelty of will, it is easy to see how much better
it is that God was pleased to produce the human race from the
one individual whom He created, than if He had originated it
in several men. For as to the other animals, He created some
solitary, and naturally seeking lonely places,&mdash;as the eagles,
kites, lions, wolves, and such like; others gregarious, which
herd together, and prefer to live in company,&mdash;as pigeons,
starlings, stags, and little fallow deer, and the like: but
neither class did He cause to be propagated from individuals,
but called into being several at once. Man, on the other
hand, whose nature was to be a mean between the angelic and
bestial, He created in such sort, that if he remained in subjection
to His Creator as his rightful Lord, and piously kept His
commandments, he should pass into the company of the angels,
and obtain, without the intervention of death,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> a blessed and
endless immortality; but if he offended the Lord his God by
a proud and disobedient use of his free will, he should become
subject to death, and live as the beasts do,&mdash;the slave
of appetite, and doomed to eternal punishment after death.
And therefore God created only one single man, not, certainly,
that he might be a solitary bereft of all society, but that by
this means the unity of society and the bond of concord might
be more effectually commended to him, men being bound
together not only by similarity of nature, but by family affection.
And indeed He did not even create the woman that
was to be given him as his wife, as he created the man, but
created her out of the man, that the whole human race might
derive from one man.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>22. <i>That God foreknew that the first man would sin, and that He at the same
time foresaw how large a multitude of godly persons would by His grace
be translated to the fellowship of the angels.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And God was not ignorant that man would sin, and that,
being himself made subject now to death, he would propagate
men doomed to die, and that these mortals would run to such
enormities in sin, that even the beasts devoid of rational will,
and who were created in numbers from the waters and the
earth, would live more securely and peaceably with their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
kind than men, who had been propagated from one individual
for the very purpose of commending concord. For not even
lions or dragons have ever waged with their kind such wars
as men have waged with one another.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> But God foresaw also
that by His grace a people would be called to adoption, and
that they, being justified by the remission of their sins, would
be united by the Holy Ghost to the holy angels in eternal
peace, the last enemy, death, being destroyed; and He knew
that this people would derive profit from the consideration
that God had caused all men to be derived from one, for the
sake of showing how highly He prizes unity in a multitude.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the nature of the human soul created in the image of God.</i></p>

<p>God, then, made man in His own image. For He created
for him a soul endowed with reason and intelligence, so that
he might excel all the creatures of earth, air, and sea, which
were not so gifted. And when He had formed the man out
of the dust of the earth, and had willed that his soul should
be such as I have said,&mdash;whether He had already made it,
and now by breathing imparted it to man, or rather made it
by breathing, so that that breath which God made by breathing
(for what else is "to breathe" than to make breath?) is
the soul,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>&mdash;He made also a wife for him, to aid him in the
work of generating his kind, and her He formed of a bone
taken out of the man's side, working in a divine manner.
For we are not to conceive of this work in a carnal fashion,
as if God wrought as we commonly see artisans, who use their
hands, and material furnished to them, that by their artistic
skill they may fashion some material object. God's hand is
God's power; and He, working invisibly, effects visible results.
But this seems fabulous rather than true to men, who measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
by customary and everyday works the power and wisdom of
God, whereby He understands and produces without seeds
even seeds themselves; and because they cannot understand
the things which at the beginning were created, they are
sceptical regarding them&mdash;as if the very things which they
do know about human propagation, conceptions and births,
would seem less incredible if told to those who had no experience
of them; though these very things, too, are attributed
by many rather to physical and natural causes than to the
work of the divine mind.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Whether the angels can be said to be the creators of any, even the least
creature.</i></p>

<p>But in this book we have nothing to do with those who do
not believe that the divine mind made or cares for this world.
As for those who believe their own Plato, that all mortal
animals&mdash;among whom man holds the pre-eminent place, and
is near to the gods themselves&mdash;were created not by that most
high God who made the world, but by other lesser gods
created by the Supreme, and exercising a delegated power
under His control,&mdash;if only those persons be delivered from
the superstition which prompts them to seek a plausible
reason for paying divine honours and sacrificing to these gods
as their creators, they will easily be disentangled also from
this their error. For it is blasphemy to believe or to say
(even before it can be understood) that any other than God
is creator of any nature, be it never so small and mortal.
And as for the angels, whom those Platonists prefer to call
gods, although they do, so far as they are permitted and commissioned,
aid in the production of the things around us, yet
not on that account are we to call them creators, any more
than we call gardeners the creators of fruits and trees.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>That God alone is the Creator of every kind of creature, whatever its
nature or form.</i></p>

<p>For whereas there is one form which is given from without

by potters and smiths, and that class of artists who
paint and fashion forms like the body of animals,&mdash;but another
and internal form which is not itself constructed, but,
as the efficient cause, produces not only the natural bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
forms, but even the life itself of the living creatures, and
which proceeds from the secret and hidden choice of an intelligent
and living nature,&mdash;let that first-mentioned form be
attributed to every artificer, but this latter to one only, God,
the Creator and Originator who made the world itself and the
angels, without the help of world or angels. For the same
divine and, so to speak, creative energy, which cannot be
made, but makes, and which gave to the earth and sky their
roundness,&mdash;this same divine, effective, and creative energy
gave their roundness to the eye and to the apple; and the
other natural objects which we anywhere see, received also
their form, not from without, but from the secret and profound
might of the Creator, who said, "Do not I fill heaven
and earth?"<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> and whose wisdom it is that "reacheth from

things."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Wherefore I know not what kind of aid the angels,
themselves created first, afforded to the Creator in making
other things. I cannot ascribe to them what perhaps they
cannot do, neither ought I to deny them such faculty as
they have. But, by their leave, I attribute the creating and
originating work which gave being to all natures to God, to
whom they themselves thankfully ascribe their existence.
We do not call gardeners the creators of their fruits, for we
read, "Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that
watereth, but God that giveth the increase."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Nay, not even
the earth itself do we call a creator, though she seems to be
the prolific mother of all things which she aids in germinating
and bursting forth from the seed, and which she keeps rooted
in her own breast; for we likewise read, "God giveth it a
body, as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own
body."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> We ought not even to call a woman the creatress
of her own offspring; for He rather is its creator who said to
His servant, "Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew
thee."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> And although the various mental emotions of a
pregnant woman do produce in the fruit of her womb similar
qualities,&mdash;as Jacob with his peeled wands caused piebald
sheep to be produced,&mdash;yet the mother as little creates her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
offspring, as she created herself. Whatever bodily or seminal
causes, then, may be used for the production of things, either
by the co-operation of angels, men, or the lower animals, or
by sexual generation; and whatever power the desires and
mental emotions of the mother have to produce in the tender
and plastic f&#339;tus, corresponding lineaments and colours; yet
the natures themselves, which are thus variously affected, are
the production of none but the most high God. It is His
occult power which pervades all things, and is present in all
without being contaminated, which gives being to all that is,
and modifies and limits its existence; so that without Him
it would not be thus or thus, nor would have any being at
all.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> If, then, in regard to that outward form which the

its founder; with how much greater reason ought we to say
that God alone is the Author of all natures, since He neither
uses for His work any material which was not made by Him,
nor any workmen who were not also made by Him, and
since, if He were, so to speak, to withdraw from created things
His creative power, they would straightway relapse into the

animals to those inferior gods who were made by the Supreme,
he meant it to be understood that the immortal part was
taken from God Himself, and that these minor creators added
the mortal part; that is to say, he meant them to be considered
the creators of our bodies, but not of our souls. But
since Porphyry maintains that if the soul is to be purified,
all entanglement with a body must be escaped from; and
at the same time agrees with Plato and the Platonists in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
thinking that those who have not spent a temperate and
honourable life return to mortal bodies as their punishment
(to bodies of brutes in Plato's opinion, to human bodies in
Porphyry's); it follows that those whom they would have us
worship as our parents and authors, that they may plausibly
call them gods, are, after all, but the forgers of our fetters
and chains,&mdash;not our creators, but our jailers and turnkeys,
who lock us up in the most bitter and melancholy house of
correction. Let the Platonists, then, either cease menacing
us with our bodies as the punishment of our souls, or preaching
that we are to worship as gods those whose work upon us
they exhort us by all means in our power to avoid and escape
from. But, indeed, both opinions are quite false. It is
false that souls return again to this life to be punished; and
it is false that there is any other creator of anything in
heaven or earth, than He who made the heaven and the earth.
For if we live in a body only to expiate our sins, how says
Plato in another place, that the world could not have been
the most beautiful and good, had it not been filled with all
kinds of creatures, mortal and immortal?<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> But if our creation
even as mortals be a divine benefit, how is it a punishment
to be restored to a body, that is, to a divine benefit? And if
God, as Plato continually maintains, embraced in His eternal
intelligence the ideas both of the universe and of all the
animals, how, then, should He not with His own hand make
them all? Could He be unwilling to be the constructor of
works, the idea and plan of which called for His ineffable
and ineffably to be praised intelligence?</p>

<p>27. <i>That the whole plenitude of the human race was embraced in the first man,

<p>With good cause, therefore, does the true religion recognise
and proclaim that the same God who created the universal
cosmos, created also all the animals, souls as well as bodies.
Among the terrestrial animals man was made by Him in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
own image, and, for the reason I have given, was made one
individual, though he was not left solitary. For there is
nothing so social by nature, so unsocial by its corruption, as
this race. And human nature has nothing more appropriate,
either for the prevention of discord, or for the healing of it,
where it exists, than the remembrance of that first parent of
us all, whom God was pleased to create alone, that all men
might be derived from one, and that they might thus be
admonished to preserve unity among their whole multitude.
But from the fact that the woman was made for him from
his side, it was plainly meant that we should learn how dear
the bond between man and wife should be. These works of
God do certainly seem extraordinary, because they are the first
works. They who do not believe them, ought not to believe
any prodigies; for these would not be called prodigies did they
not happen out of the ordinary course of nature. But, is it
possible that anything should happen in vain, however hidden
be its cause, in so grand a government of divine providence?
One of the sacred Psalmists says, "Come, behold the works
of the Lord, what prodigies He hath wrought in the earth."<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
Why God made woman out of man's side, and what this first
prodigy prefigured, I shall, with God's help, tell in another
place. But at present, since this book must be concluded, let
us merely say that in this first man, who was created in the
beginning, there was laid the foundation, not indeed evidently,
but in God's foreknowledge, of these two cities or societies, so
far as regards the human race. For from that man all men
were to be derived&mdash;some of them to be associated with the
good angels in their reward, others with the wicked in punishment;
all being ordered by the secret yet just judgment of
God. For since it is written, "All the paths of the Lord are
mercy and truth,"<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> neither can His grace be unjust, nor His
justice cruel.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_THIRTEENTH" id="BOOK_THIRTEENTH">BOOK THIRTEENTH.</a></h2>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<p class="center">IN THIS BOOK IT IS TAUGHT THAT DEATH IS PENAL, AND HAD ITS
ORIGIN IN ADAM'S SIN.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of the fall of the first man, through which mortality has been contracted.</i></p>

<p>Having disposed of the very difficult questions concerning
the origin of our world and the beginning of
the human race, the natural order requires that we now
discuss the fall of the first man (we may say of the first
men), and of the origin and propagation of human death.
For God had not made man like the angels, in such a
condition that, even though they had sinned, they could none
the more die. He had so made them, that if they discharged
the obligations of obedience, an angelic immortality and a
blessed eternity might ensue, without the intervention of
death; but if they disobeyed, death should be visited on
them with just sentence&mdash;which, too, has been spoken to in
the preceding book.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of that death which can affect an immortal soul, and of that to which
the body is subject.</i></p>

<p>But I see I must speak a little more carefully of the
nature of death. For although the human soul is truly
affirmed to be immortal, yet it also has a certain death of
its own. For it is therefore called immortal, because, in a
sense, it does not cease to live and to feel; while the body is
called mortal, because it can be forsaken of all life, and cannot
by itself live at all. The death, then, of the soul takes place
when God forsakes it, as the death of the body when the
soul forsakes it. Therefore the death of both&mdash;that is, of the
whole man&mdash;occurs when the soul, forsaken by God, forsakes
the body. For, in this case, neither is God the life of the
soul, nor the soul the life of the body. And this death of
the whole man is followed by that which, on the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
of the divine oracles, we call the second death. This the
Saviour referred to when He said, "Fear Him which is able
to destroy both soul and body in hell."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> And since this
does not happen before the soul is so joined to its body that
they cannot be separated at all, it may be matter of wonder
how the body can be said to be killed by that death in which
it is not forsaken by the soul, but, being animated and rendered
sensitive by it, is tormented. For in that penal and
everlasting punishment, of which in its own place we are to
speak more at large, the soul is justly said to die, because it
does not live in connection with God; but how can we say
that the body is dead, seeing that it lives by the soul? For
it could not otherwise feel the bodily torments which are to
follow the resurrection. Is it because life of every kind is
good, and pain an evil, that we decline to say that that body
lives, in which the soul is the cause, not of life, but of pain?
The soul, then, lives by God when it lives well, for it cannot
live well unless by God working in it what is good; and the
body lives by the soul when the soul lives in the body,
whether itself be living by God or no. For the wicked man's
life in the body is a life not of the soul, but of the body,
which even dead souls&mdash;that is, souls forsaken of God&mdash;can
confer upon bodies, how little soever of their own proper life,
by which they are immortal, they retain. But in the last
damnation, though man does not cease to feel, yet because
this feeling of his is neither sweet with pleasure nor wholesome
with repose, but painfully penal, it is not without reason
called death rather than life. And it is called the second
death because it follows the first, which sunders the two
cohering essences, whether these be God and the soul, or
the soul and the body. Of the first and bodily death, then,
we may say that to the good it is good, and evil to the evil.
But, doubtless, the second, as it happens to none of the good,
so it can be good for none.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Whether death, which by the sin of our first parents has passed upon all
men, is the punishment of sin, even to the good.</i></p>

<p>But a question not to be shirked arises: Whether in very
truth death, which separates soul and body, is good to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
good?<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> For if it be, how has it come to pass that such a
thing should be the punishment of sin? For the first men
would not have suffered death had they not sinned. How,
then, can that be good to the good, which could not have
happened except to the evil? Then, again, if it could only
happen to the evil, to the good it ought not to be good, but
non-existent. For why should there be any punishment where
there is nothing to punish? Wherefore we must say that the
first men were indeed so created, that if they had not sinned,
they would not have experienced any kind of death; but that,
having become sinners, they were so punished with death, that
whatsoever sprang from their stock should also be punished
with the same death. For nothing else could be born of them
than that which they themselves had been. Their nature was
deteriorated in proportion to the greatness of the condemnation
of their sin, so that what existed as punishment in those
who first sinned, became a natural consequence in their children.
For man is not produced by man, as he was from the
dust. For dust was the material out of which man was
made: man is the parent by whom man is begotten. Wherefore
earth and flesh are not the same thing, though flesh be
made of earth. But as man the parent is, such is man the
offspring. In the first man, therefore, there existed the whole
human nature, which was to be transmitted by the woman
to posterity, when that conjugal union received the divine
sentence of its own condemnation; and what man was made,
not when created, but when he sinned and was punished, this
he propagated, so far as the origin of sin and death are concerned.
For neither by sin nor its punishment was he himself
reduced to that infantine and helpless infirmity of body
and mind which we see in children. For God ordained that
infants should begin the world as the young of beasts begin
it, since their parents had fallen to the level of the beasts in
the fashion of their life and of their death; as it is written,
"Man when he was in honour understood not; he became
like the beasts that have no understanding."<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Nay more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
infants, we see, are even feebler in the use and movement of
their limbs, and more infirm to choose and refuse, than the
most tender offspring of other animals; as if the force that
dwells in human nature were destined to surpass all other
living things so much the more eminently, as its energy has
been longer restrained, and the time of its exercise delayed,
just as an arrow flies the higher the further back it has been
drawn. To this infantine imbecility<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> the first man did not
fall by his lawless presumption and just sentence; but human
nature was in his person vitiated and altered to such an
extent, that he suffered in his members the warring of disobedient
lust, and became subject to the necessity of dying.
And what he himself had become by sin and punishment,
such he generated those whom he begot; that is to say, subject
to sin and death. And if infants are delivered from this
bondage of sin by the Redeemer's grace, they can suffer only
this death which separates soul and body; but being redeemed
from the obligation of sin, they do not pass to that second
endless and penal death.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Why death, the punishment of sin, is not withheld from those who by the
grace of regeneration are absolved from sin.</i></p>

<p>If, moreover, any one is solicitous about this point, how, if
death be the very punishment of sin, they whose guilt is cancelled
by grace do yet suffer death, this difficulty has already
been handled and solved in our other work which we have
written on the baptism of infants.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> There it was said that the
parting of soul and body was left, though its connection with
sin was removed, for this reason, that if the immortality of
the body followed immediately upon the sacrament of regeneration,
faith itself would be thereby enervated. For faith is
then only faith when it waits in hope for what is not yet seen
in substance. And by the vigour and conflict of faith, at least
in times past, was the fear of death overcome. Specially was
this conspicuous in the holy martyrs, who could have had no
victory, no glory, to whom there could not even have been any
conflict, if, after the laver of regeneration, saints could not suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
bodily death. Who would not, then, in company with the
infants presented for baptism, run to the grace of Christ, that
so he might not be dismissed from the body? And thus faith
would not be tested with an unseen reward; and so would
not even be faith, seeking and receiving an immediate recompense
of its works. But now, by the greater and more admirable
grace of the Saviour, the punishment of sin is turned
to the service of righteousness. For then it was proclaimed
to man, "If thou sinnest, thou shalt die;" now it is said to
the martyr, "Die, that thou sin not." Then it was said, "If
ye transgress the commandments, ye shall die;" now it is
said, "If ye decline death, ye transgress the commandment."
That which was formerly set as an object of terror, that men
might not sin, is now to be undergone if we would not sin.
Thus, by the unutterable mercy of God, even the very punishment
of wickedness has become the armour of virtue, and the
penalty of the sinner becomes the reward of the righteous.
For then death was incurred by sinning, now righteousness is
fulfilled by dying. In the case of the holy martyrs it is so;
for to them the persecutor proposes the alternative, apostasy
or death. For the righteous prefer by believing to suffer what
the first transgressors suffered by not believing. For unless
they had sinned, they would not have died; but the martyrs
sin if they do not die. The one died because they sinned, the
others do not sin because they die. By the guilt of the first,
punishment was incurred; by the punishment of the second,
guilt is prevented. Not that death, which was before an evil,
has become something good, but only that God has granted to
faith this grace, that death, which is the admitted opposite to
life, should become the instrument by which life is reached.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>As the wicked make an ill use of the law, which is good, so the good make
a good use of death, which is an ill.</i></p>

<p>The apostle, wishing to show how hurtful a thing sin is,
when grace does not aid us, has not hesitated to say that the
strength of sin is that very law by which sin is prohibited.
"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law."<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
Most certainly true; for prohibition increases the desire of
illicit action, if righteousness is not so loved that the desire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
sin is conquered by that love. But unless divine grace aid
us, we cannot love nor delight in true righteousness. But lest
the law should be thought to be an evil, since it is called the
strength of sin, the apostle, when treating a similar question in
another place, says, "The law indeed is holy, and the commandment
holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is holy
made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear
sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin
by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> <i>Exceeding</i>,
he says, because the transgression is more heinous when
through the increasing lust of sin the law itself also is despised.
Why have we thought it worth while to mention this? For
this reason, because, as the law is not an evil when it increases
the lust of those who sin, so neither is death a good thing
when it increases the glory of those who suffer it, since either
the former is abandoned wickedly, and makes transgressors, or
the latter is embraced for the truth's sake, and makes martyrs.
And thus the law is indeed good, because it is prohibition of
sin, and death is evil because it is the wages of sin; but as
wicked men make an evil use not only of evil, but also of good
things, so the righteous make a good use not only of good, but
also of evil things. Whence it comes to pass that the wicked
make an ill use of the law, though the law is good; and that
the good die well, though death is an evil.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Of the evil of death in general, considered as the separation of soul
and body.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore, as regards bodily death, that is, the separation
of the soul from the body, it is good unto none while it is
being endured by those whom we say are in the article of
death. For the very violence with which body and soul are
wrenched asunder, which in the living had been conjoined
and closely intertwined, brings with it a harsh experience,
jarring horridly on nature so long as it continues, till there
comes a total loss of sensation, which arose from the very
interpenetration of spirit and flesh. And all this anguish is
sometimes forestalled by one stroke of the body or sudden
flitting of the soul, the swiftness of which prevents it from
being felt. But whatever that may be in the dying which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
with violently painful sensation robs of all sensation, yet, when
it is piously and faithfully borne, it increases the merit of
patience, but does not make the name of punishment inapplicable.
Death, proceeding by ordinary generation from the
first man, is the punishment of all who are born of him, yet,
if it be endured for righteousness' sake, it becomes the glory
of those who are born again; and though death be the award
of sin, it sometimes secures that nothing be awarded to sin.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the death which the unbaptized</i><a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> <i>suffer for the confession of Christ.</i></p>

<p>For whatever unbaptized persons die confessing Christ, this
confession is of the same efficacy for the remission of sins as
if they were washed in the sacred font of baptism. For He
who said, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,"<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> made also an exception
in their favour, in that other sentence where He no
less absolutely said, "Whosoever shall confess me before men,
him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven;"<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
and in another place, "Whosoever will lose his life for my
sake, shall find it."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> And this explains the verse, "Precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> For
what is more precious than a death by which a man's sins are
all forgiven, and his merits increased an hundredfold? For
those who have been baptized when they could no longer
escape death, and have departed this life with all their sins
blotted out, have not equal merit with those who did not
defer death, though it was in their power to do so, but preferred
to end their life by confessing Christ, rather than by
denying Him to secure an opportunity of baptism. And even
had they denied Him under pressure of the fear of death, this
too would have been forgiven them in that baptism, in which
was remitted even the enormous wickedness of those who had
slain Christ. But how abundant in these men must have
been the grace of the Spirit, who breathes where He listeth,
seeing that they so dearly loved Christ as to be unable to deny
Him even in so sore an emergency, and with so sure a hope
of pardon! Precious, therefore, is the death of the saints, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
whom the grace of Christ has been applied with such gracious
effects, that they do not hesitate to meet death themselves, if
so be they might meet Him. And precious is it, also, because
it has proved that what was originally ordained for the punishment
of the sinner, has been used for the production of a richer
harvest of righteousness. But not on this account should we
look upon death as a good thing, for it is diverted to such
useful purposes, not by any virtue of its own, but by the
divine interference. Death was originally proposed as an
object of dread, that sin might not be committed; now it must
be undergone that sin may not be committed, or, if committed,
be remitted, and the award of righteousness bestowed on him
whose victory has earned it.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap1318"></a>8. <i>That the saints, by suffering the first death for the truth's sake, are
freed from the second.</i></p>

<p>For if we look at the matter a little more carefully, we shall
see that even when a man dies faithfully and laudably for the
truth's sake, it is still death he is avoiding. For he submits
to some part of death, for the very purpose of avoiding the
whole, and the second and eternal death over and above. He
submits to the separation of soul and body, lest the soul be
separated both from God and from the body, and so the whole
first death be completed, and the second death receive him
everlastingly. Wherefore death is indeed, as I said, good to
none while it is being actually suffered, and while it is subduing
the dying to its power; but it is meritoriously endured
for the sake of retaining or winning what <i>is</i> good. And regarding
what happens after death, it is no absurdity to say
that death is good to the good, and evil to the evil. For the
disembodied spirits of the just are at rest; but those of the
wicked suffer punishment till their bodies rise again,&mdash;those of
the just to life everlasting, and of the others to death eternal,
which is called the second death.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether we should say that the moment of death, in which sensation ceases,
occurs in the experience of the dying or in that of the dead.</i></p>

<p>The point of time in which the souls of the good and evil
are separated from the body, are we to say it is after death, or
in death rather? If it is after death, then it is not death
which is good or evil, since death is done with and past, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
it is the life which the soul has now entered on. Death was
an evil when it was present, that is to say, when it was being
suffered by the dying; for to them it brought with it a severe
and grievous experience, which the good make a good use of.
But when death is past, how can that which no longer is be
either good or evil? Still further, if we examine the matter
more closely, we shall see that even that sore and grievous
pain which the dying experience is not death itself. For so
long as they have any sensation, they are certainly still alive;
and, if still alive, must rather be said to be in a state previous
to death than in death. For when death actually comes, it
robs us of all bodily sensation, which, while death is only approaching,
is painful. And thus it is difficult to explain how
we speak of those who are not yet dead, but are agonized in
their last and mortal extremity, as being in the article of
death. Yet what else can we call them than dying persons?
for when death which was imminent shall have actually come,
we can no longer call them dying but dead. No one, therefore,
is dying unless living; since even he who is in the last
extremity of life, and, as we say, giving up the ghost, yet lives.
The same person is therefore at once dying and living, but
drawing near to death, departing from life; yet in life, because
his spirit yet abides in the body; not yet in death, because
not yet has his spirit forsaken the body. But if, when it has
forsaken it, the man is not even then in death, but after death,
who shall say when he is in death? On the one hand, no one
can be called dying, if a man cannot be dying and living at
the same time; and as long as the soul is in the body, we
cannot deny that he is living. On the other hand, if the man
who is approaching death be rather called dying, I know not
who is living.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the life of mortals, which is rather to be called death than life.</i></p>

<p>For no sooner do we begin to live in this dying body, than
we begin to move ceaselessly towards death.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> For in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
whole course of this life (if life we must call it) its mutability
tends towards death. Certainly there is no one who is not
nearer it this year than last year, and to-morrow than to-day,
and to-day than yesterday, and a short while hence than now,
and now than a short while ago. For whatever time we live
is deducted from our whole term of life, and that which
remains is daily becoming less and less; so that our whole
life is nothing but a race towards death, in which no one is
allowed to stand still for a little space, or to go somewhat
more slowly, but all are driven forwards with an impartial
movement, and with equal rapidity. For he whose life is short
spends a day no more swiftly than he whose life is longer.
But while the equal moments are impartially snatched from
both, the one has a nearer and the other a more remote goal
to reach with this their equal speed. It is one thing to make
a longer journey, and another to walk more slowly. He,
therefore, who spends longer time on his way to death does
not proceed at a more leisurely pace, but goes over more
ground. Further, if every man begins to die, that is, is in
death, as soon as death has begun to show itself in him (by
taking away life, to wit; for when life is all taken away, the
man will be then not in death, but after death), then he begins
to die so soon as he begins to live. For what else is going
on in all his days, hours, and moments, until this slow-working
death is fully consummated? And then comes the time
<i>after death</i>, instead of that in which life was being withdrawn,
and which we called being <i>in death</i>. Man, then, is never in
life from the moment he dwells in this dying rather than
living body,&mdash;if, at least, he cannot be in life and death at
once. Or rather, shall we say, he is in both?&mdash;in life,
namely, which he lives till all is consumed; but in death
also, which he dies as his life is consumed? For if he is not
in life, what is it which is consumed till all be gone? And
if he is not in death, what is this consumption itself? For
when the whole of life has been consumed, the expression
"after death" would be meaningless, had that consumption
not been death. And if, when it has all been consumed, a
man is not in death but after death, when is he in death,
unless when life is being consumed away?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">11. <i>Whether one can both be living and dead at the same time.</i></p>

<p>But if it is absurd to say that a man is in death before he
reaches death (for to what is his course running as he passes
through life, if already he is in death?), and if it outrage
common usage to speak of a man being at once alive and
dead, as much as it does so, to speak of him as at once asleep
and awake, it remains to be asked when a man is dying?
For, before death comes, he is not dying but living; and
when death has come, he is not dying but dead. The one is
before, the other after death. When, then, is he in death so
that we can say he is dying? For as there are three times,
before death, in death, after death, so there are three states
corresponding, living, dying, dead. And it is very hard to
define when a man is in death or dying, when he is neither
living, which is before death, nor dead, which is after death,
but dying, which is in death. For so long as the soul is in
the body, especially if consciousness remain, the man certainly
lives; for body and soul constitute the man. And thus,
before death, he cannot be said to be in death; but when,
on the other hand, the soul has departed, and all bodily
sensation is extinct, death is past, and the man is dead.
Between these two states the dying condition finds no place;
for if a man yet lives, death has not arrived; if he has ceased
to live, death is past. Never, then, is he dying, that is, comprehended
in the state of death. So also in the passing of
time,&mdash;you try to lay your finger on the present, and cannot
find it, because the present occupies no space, but is only
the transition of time from the future to the past. Must we
then conclude that there is thus no death of the body at all?
For if there is, where is it, since it is in no one, and no one
can be in it? Since, indeed, if there is yet life, death is not
yet; for this state is before death, not in death: and if life
has already ceased, death is not present; for this state is
after death, not in death. On the other hand, if there is
no death before or after, what do we mean when we say
"after death," or "before death?" This is a foolish way
of speaking if there is no death. And would that we had
lived so well in Paradise that in very truth there were now
no death! But not only does it now exist, but so grievous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
a thing is it, that no skill is sufficient either to explain or to
escape it.</p>

<p>Let us, then, speak in the customary way,&mdash;no man ought
to speak otherwise,&mdash;and let us call the time before death
come, "before death;" as it is written, "Praise no man before
his death."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> And when it has happened, let us say that
"after death" this or that took place. And of the present
time let us speak as best we can, as when we say, "He,
when dying, made his will, and left this or that to such and
such persons,"&mdash;though, of course, he could not do so unless
he were living, and did this rather before death than in death.
And let us use the same phraseology as Scripture uses; for it
makes no scruple of saying that the dead are not after but in
death. So that verse, "For in death there is no remembrance
of thee."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> For until the resurrection men are justly said to
be in death; as every one is said to be in sleep till he
awakes. However, though we can say of persons in sleep
that they are sleeping, we cannot speak in this way of the
dead, and say they are dying. For, so far as regards the
death of the body, of which we are now speaking, one cannot
say that those who are already separated from their bodies
continue dying. But this, you see, is just what I was saying,&mdash;that
no words can explain how either the dying are said
to live, or how the dead are said, even after death, to be in
death. For how can they be after death if they be in death,
especially when we do not even call them dying, as we call
those in sleep, sleeping; and those in languor, languishing;
and those in grief, grieving; and those in life, living? And
yet the dead, until they rise again, are said to be in death,
but cannot be called dying.</p>

<p>And therefore I think it has not unsuitably nor inappropriately
come to pass, though not by the intention of man,
yet perhaps with divine purpose, that this Latin word
<i>moritur</i> cannot be declined by the grammarians according to
the rule followed by similar words. For <i>oritur</i> gives the
form <i>ortus est</i> for the perfect; and all similar verbs form
this tense from their perfect participles. But if we ask
the perfect of <i>moritur</i>, we get the regular answer, <i>mortuus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
est</i> with a double <i>u</i>. For thus <i>mortuus</i> is pronounced, like
<i>fatuus</i>, <i>arduus</i>, <i>conspicuus</i>, and similar words, which are not
perfect participles but adjectives, and are declined without
regard to tense. But <i>mortuus</i>, though in form an adjective,
is used as perfect participle, as if that were to be declined
which cannot be declined; and thus it has suitably come
to pass that, as the thing itself cannot in point of fact be
declined, so neither can the word significant of the act be
declined. Yet, by the aid of our Redeemer's grace, we may
manage at least to decline the second. For that is more
grievous still, and, indeed, of all evils the worst, since it consists
not in the separation of soul and body, but in the uniting
of both in death eternal. And there, in striking contrast to
our present conditions, men will not be before or after death,
but always in death; and thus never living, never dead, but
endlessly dying. And never can a man be more disastrously
in death than when death itself shall be deathless.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>What death God intended, when He threatened our first parents with death
if they should disobey His commandment.</i></p>

<p>When, therefore, it is asked what death it was with which
God threatened our first parents if they should transgress
the commandment they had received from Him, and should
fail to preserve their obedience,&mdash;whether it was the death
of soul, or of body, or of the whole man, or that which is
called second death,&mdash;we must answer, It is all. For the
first consists of two; the second is the complete death, which
consists of all. For, as the whole earth consists of many
lands, and the Church universal of many churches, so death
universal consists of all deaths. The first consists of two,
one of the body, and another of the soul. So that the first
death is a death of the whole man, since the soul without
God and without the body suffers punishment for a time;
but the second is when the soul, without God but with the
body, suffers punishment everlasting. When, therefore, God
said to that first man whom he had placed in Paradise, referring
to the forbidden fruit, "In the day that thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die,"<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> that threatening included not
only the first part of the first death, by which the soul is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
deprived of God; nor only the subsequent part of the first
death, by which the body is deprived of the soul; nor only
the whole first death itself, by which the soul is punished in
separation from God and from the body;&mdash;but it includes
whatever of death there is, even to that final death which is
called second, and to which none is subsequent.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>What was the first punishment of the transgression of our first parents?</i></p>

<p>For, as soon as our first parents had transgressed the commandment,
divine grace forsook them, and they were confounded
at their own wickedness; and therefore they took
fig-leaves (which were possibly the first that came to hand in
their troubled state of mind), and covered their shame; for
though their members remained the same, they had shame
now where they had none before. They experienced a new
motion of their flesh, which had become disobedient to them,
in strict retribution of their own disobedience to God. For
the soul, revelling in its own liberty, and scorning to serve
God, was itself deprived of the command it had formerly
maintained over the body. And because it had wilfully
deserted its superior Lord, it no longer held its own inferior
servant; neither could it hold the flesh subject, as it would
always have been able to do had it remained itself subject to
God. Then began the flesh to lust against the Spirit,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> in
which strife we are born, deriving from the first transgression
a seed of death, and bearing in our members, and in our
vitiated nature, the contest or even victory of the flesh.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>In what state man was made by God, and into what estate he fell by the
choice of his own will.</i></p>

<p>For God, the author of natures, not of vices, created man
upright; but man, being of his own will corrupted, and justly
condemned, begot corrupted and condemned children. For
we all were in that one man, since we all were that one man
who fell into sin by the woman who was made from him
before the sin. For not yet was the particular form created
and distributed to us, in which we as individuals were to
live, but already the seminal nature was there from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
we were to be propagated; and this being vitiated by sin, and
bound by the chain of death, and justly condemned, man could
not be born of man in any other state. And thus, from the
bad use of free will, there originated the whole train of evil,
which, with its concatenation of miseries, convoys the human
race from its depraved origin, as from a corrupt root, on to the
destruction of the second death, which has no end, those only
being excepted who are freed by the grace of God.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>That Adam in his sin forsook God ere God forsook him, and that his
falling away from God was the first death of the soul.</i></p>

<p>It may perhaps be supposed that because God said, "Ye
shall die the death,"<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> and not "deaths," we should understand
only that death which occurs when the soul is deserted by
God, who is its life; for it was not deserted by God, and so
deserted Him, but deserted Him, and so was deserted by Him.
For its own will was the originator of its evil, as God was
the originator of its motions towards good, both in making it
when it was not, and in re-making it when it had fallen and
perished. But though we suppose that God meant only this.
death, and that the words, "In the day ye eat of it ye shall
die the death," should be understood as meaning, "In the day
ye desert me in disobedience, I will desert you in justice," yet
assuredly in this death the other deaths also were threatened,
which were its inevitable consequence. For in the first stirring
of the disobedient motion which was felt in the flesh of the
disobedient soul, and which caused our first parents to cover
their shame, one death indeed is experienced, that, namely,
which occurs when God forsakes the soul. (This was intimated
by the words He uttered, when the man, stupefied by
fear, had hid himself, "Adam, where art thou?"<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>&mdash;words
which He used not in ignorance of inquiry, but warning him
to consider where he was, since God was not with him.) But
when the soul itself forsook the body, corrupted and decayed
with age, the other death was experienced of which God had
spoken in pronouncing man's sentence, "Earth thou art, and
unto earth shalt thou return."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> And of these two deaths that
first death of the whole man is composed. And this first death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
is finally followed by the second, unless man be freed by grace.
For the body would not return to the earth from which it was
made, save only by the death proper to itself, which occurs
when it is forsaken of the soul, its life. And therefore it is
agreed among all Christians who truthfully hold the catholic
faith, that we are subject to the death of the body, not by the
law of nature, by which God ordained no death for man, but
by His righteous infliction on account of sin; for God, taking
vengeance on sin, said to the man, in whom we all then were,
"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>16. <i>Concerning the philosophers who think that the separation of soul and body
is not penal, though Plato represents the supreme Deity as promising to
the inferior gods that they shall never be dismissed from their bodies.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But the philosophers against whom we are defending the
city of God, that is, His Church, seem to themselves to have
good cause to deride us, because we say that the separation of the
soul from the body is to be held as part of man's punishment.
For they suppose that the blessedness of the soul then only is
complete, when it is quite denuded of the body, and returns to
God a pure and simple, and, as it were, naked soul. On this
point, if I should find nothing in their own literature to refute
this opinion, I should be forced laboriously to demonstrate that
it is not the body, but the corruptibility of the body, which is
a burden to the soul. Hence that sentence of Scripture we
quoted in a foregoing book, "For the corruptible body presseth
down the soul."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The word corruptible is added to show that
the soul is burdened, not by any body whatsoever, but by the
body such as it has become in consequence of sin. And even
though the word had not been added, we could understand
nothing else. But when Plato most expressly declares that
the gods who are made by the Supreme have immortal bodies,
and when he introduces their Maker himself promising them
as a great boon that they should abide in their bodies eternally,
and never by any death be loosed from them, why do these
adversaries of ours, for the sake of troubling the Christian
faith, feign to be ignorant of what they quite well know, and
even prefer to contradict themselves rather than lose an opportunity
of contradicting us? Here are Plato's words, as Cicero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
has translated them,<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> in which he introduces the Supreme
addressing the gods He had made, and saying, "Ye who are
sprung from a divine stock, consider of what works I am the
parent and author. These (your bodies) are indestructible
so long as I will it; although all that is composed can be
destroyed. But it is wicked to dissolve what reason has
compacted. But, seeing that ye have been born, ye cannot
indeed be immortal and indestructible; yet ye shall by no
means be destroyed, nor shall any fates consign you to death,
and prove superior to my will, which is a stronger assurance
of your perpetuity than those bodies to which ye were joined
when ye were born." Plato, you see, says that the gods are
both mortal by the connection of the body and soul, and yet
are rendered immortal by the will and decree of their Maker.
If, therefore, it is a punishment to the soul to be connected
with any body whatever, why does God address them as if
they were afraid of death, that is, of the separation of soul and
body? Why does He seek to reassure them by promising
them immortality, not in virtue of their nature, which is
composite and not simple, but by virtue of His invincible
will, whereby He can effect that neither things born die, nor
things compounded be dissolved, but preserved eternally?</p>

<p>Whether this opinion of Plato's about the stars is true or
not, is another question. For we cannot at once grant to him
that these luminous bodies or globes, which by day and night
shine on the earth with the light of their bodily substance,
have also intellectual and blessed souls which animate each
its own body, as he confidently affirms of the universe itself,
as if it were one huge animal, in which all other animals were
contained.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> But this, as I said, is another question, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
have not undertaken to discuss at present. This much only
I deemed right to bring forward, in opposition to those who so
pride themselves on being, or on being called Platonists, that
they blush to be Christians, and who cannot brook to be called
by a name which the common people also bear, lest they
vulgarize the philosophers' coterie, which is proud in proportion
to its exclusiveness. These men, seeking a weak point in the
Christian doctrine, select for attack the eternity of the body,
as if it were a contradiction to contend for the blessedness of
the soul, and to wish it to be always resident in the body,
bound, as it were, in a lamentable chain; and this although
Plato, their own founder and master, affirms that it was granted
by the Supreme as a boon to the gods He had made, that
they should not die, that is, should not be separated from the
bodies with which He had connected them.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Against those who affirm that earthly bodies cannot be made incorruptible
and eternal.</i></p>

<p>These same philosophers further contend that terrestrial
bodies cannot be eternal, though they make no doubt that the
whole earth, which is itself the central member of their god,&mdash;not,
indeed, of the greatest, but yet of a great god, that is, of
this whole world,&mdash;is eternal. Since, then, the Supreme made
for them another god, that is, this world, superior to the other
gods beneath Him; and since they suppose that this god is an
animal, having, as they affirm, a rational or intellectual soul
enclosed in the huge mass of its body, and having, as the fitly
situated and adjusted members of its body, the four elements,
whose union they wish to be indissoluble and eternal, lest
perchance this great god of theirs might some day perish;
what reason is there that the earth, which is the central
member in the body of a greater creature, should be eternal,
and the bodies of other terrestrial creatures should not possibly
be eternal if God should so will it? But earth, say they, must
return to earth, out of which the terrestrial bodies of the
animals have been taken. For this, they say, is the reason
of the necessity of their death and dissolution, and this the
manner of their restoration to the solid and eternal earth
whence they came. But if any one says the same thing of
fire, holding that the bodies which are derived from it to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
celestial beings must be restored to the universal fire, does
not the immortality which Plato represents these gods as
receiving from the Supreme evanesce in the heat of this
dispute? Or does this not happen with those celestials
because God, whose will, as Plato says, overpowers all powers,
has willed it should not be so? What, then, hinders God from
ordaining the same of terrestrial bodies? And since, indeed,
Plato acknowledges that God can prevent things that are born
from dying, and things that are joined from being sundered,
and things that are composed from being dissolved, and can
ordain that the souls once allotted to their bodies should never
abandon them, but enjoy along with them immortality and
everlasting bliss, why may He not also effect that terrestrial
bodies die not? Is God powerless to do everything that is
special to the Christian's creed, but powerful to effect everything
the Platonists desire? The philosophers, forsooth, have
been admitted to a knowledge of the divine purposes and
power which has been denied to the prophets! The truth is,
that the Spirit of God taught His prophets so much of His
will as He thought fit to reveal, but the philosophers, in their
efforts to discover it, were deceived by human conjecture.</p>

<p>But they should not have been so led astray, I will not say
by their ignorance, but by their obstinacy, as to contradict
themselves so frequently; for they maintain, with all their
vaunted might, that in order to the happiness of the soul, it
must abandon not only its earthly body, but every kind of
body. And yet they hold that the gods, whose souls are most
blessed, are bound to everlasting bodies, the celestials to fiery
bodies, and the soul of Jove himself (or this world, as they
would have us believe) to all the physical elements which
compose this entire mass reaching from earth to heaven. For
this soul Plato believes to be extended and diffused by musical
numbers,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> from the middle of the inside of the earth, which
geometricians call the centre, outwards through all its parts
to the utmost heights and extremities of the heavens; so that
this world is a very great and blessed immortal animal, whose
soul has both the perfect blessedness of wisdom, and never
leaves its own body, and whose body has life everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
from the soul, and by no means clogs or hinders it, though
itself be not a simple body, but compacted of so many and so
huge materials. Since, therefore, they allow so much to their
own conjectures, why do they refuse to believe that by the
divine will and power immortality can be conferred on earthly
bodies, in which the souls would be neither oppressed with
the burden of them, nor separated from them by any death,
but live eternally and blessedly? Do they not assert that
their own gods so live in bodies of fire, and that Jove himself,
their king, so lives in the physical elements? If, in order to
its blessedness, the soul must quit every kind of body, let
their gods flit from the starry spheres, and Jupiter from earth
to sky; or, if they cannot do so, let them be pronounced
miserable. But neither alternative will these men adopt. For,
on the one hand, they dare not ascribe to their own gods a
departure from the body, lest they should seem to worship
mortals; on the other hand, they dare not deny their happiness,
lest they should acknowledge wretches as gods. Therefore,
to obtain blessedness, we need not quit every kind of
body, but only the corruptible, cumbersome, painful, dying,&mdash;not
such bodies as the goodness of God contrived for the first
man, but such only as man's sin entailed.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of earthly bodies, which the philosophers affirm cannot be in heavenly places,
because whatever is of earth is by its natural weight attracted to earth.</i></p>

<p>But it is necessary, they say, that the natural weight of
earthly bodies either keep them on earth or draw them to it;
and therefore they cannot be in heaven. Our first parents
were indeed on earth, in a well-wooded and fruitful spot,
which has been named Paradise. But let our adversaries a
little more carefully consider this subject of earthly weight,
because it has important bearings, both on the ascension of
the body of Christ, and also on the resurrection body of the
saints. If human skill can by some contrivance fabricate
vessels that float, out of metals which sink as soon as they
are placed on the water, how much more credible is it that
God, by some occult mode of operation, should even more
certainly effect that these earthy masses be emancipated from
the downward pressure of their weight? This cannot be impossible
to that God by whose almighty will, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
Plato, neither things born perish, nor things composed dissolve,
especially since it is much more wonderful that spiritual and
bodily essences be conjoined than that bodies be adjusted to
other material substances. Can we not also easily believe
that souls, being made perfectly blessed, should be endowed
with the power of moving their earthy but incorruptible
bodies as they please, with almost spontaneous movement,
and of placing them where they please with the readiest
action? If the angels transport whatever terrestrial creatures
they please from any place they please, and convey them
whither they please, is it to be believed that they cannot do
so without toil and the feeling of burden? Why, then, may
we not believe that the spirits of the saints, made perfect and
blessed by divine grace, can carry their own bodies where
they please, and set them where they will? For, though we
have been accustomed to notice, in bearing weights, that the
larger the quantity the greater the weight of earthy bodies is,
and that the greater the weight the more burdensome it is,
yet the soul carries the members of its own flesh with less
difficulty when they are massive with health, than in sickness
when they are wasted. And though the hale and strong man
feels heavier to other men carrying him than the lank and
sickly, yet the man himself moves and carries his own body
with less feeling of burden when he has the greater bulk of
vigorous health, than when his frame is reduced to a minimum
by hunger or disease. Of such consequence, in estimating the
weight of earthly bodies, even while yet corruptible and mortal,
is the consideration not of dead weight, but of the healthy
equilibrium of the parts. And what words can tell the difference
between what we now call health and future immortality?
Let not the philosophers, then, think to upset our
faith with arguments from the weight of bodies; for I don't
care to inquire why they cannot believe an earthly body can
be in heaven, while the whole earth is suspended on nothing.
For perhaps the world keeps its central place by the same
law that attracts to its centre all heavy bodies. But this I
say, if the lesser gods, to whom Plato committed the creation
of man and the other terrestrial creatures, were able, as he
affirms, to withdraw from the fire its quality of burning, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
they left it that of lighting, so that it should shine through
the eyes; and if to the supreme God Plato also concedes the
power of preserving from death things that have been born,
and of preserving from dissolution things that are composed
of parts so different as body and spirit;&mdash;are we to hesitate to
concede to this same God the power to operate on the flesh of
him whom He has endowed with immortality, so as to withdraw
its corruption but leave its nature, remove its burdensome
weight but retain its seemly form and members? But
concerning our belief in the resurrection of the dead, and
concerning their immortal bodies, we shall speak more at
large, God willing, in the end of this work.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Against the opinion of those who do not believe that the primitive men would
have been immortal if they had not sinned.</i></p>

<p>At present let us go on, as we have begun, to give some
explanation regarding the bodies of our first parents. I say
then, that, except as the just consequence of sin, they would
not have been subjected even to this death, which is good to
the good,&mdash;this death, which is not exclusively known and
believed in by a few, but is known to all, by which soul and
body are separated, and by which the body of an animal
which was but now visibly living is now visibly dead. For
though there can be no manner of doubt that the souls of the
just and holy dead live in peaceful rest, yet so much better
would it be for them to be alive in healthy, well-conditioned
bodies, that even those who hold the tenet that it is most
blessed to be quit of every kind of body, condemn this opinion
in spite of themselves. For no one will dare to set wise men,
whether yet to die or already dead,&mdash;in other words, whether
already quit of the body, or shortly to be so,&mdash;above the immortal
gods, to whom the Supreme, in Plato, promises as a
munificent gift life indissoluble, or in eternal union with their
bodies. But this same Plato thinks that nothing better can
happen to men than that they pass through life piously and
justly, and, being separated from their bodies, be received
into the bosom of the gods, who never abandon theirs; "that,
oblivious of the past, they may revisit the upper air, and
conceive the longing to return again to the body."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Virgil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
is applauded for borrowing this from the Platonic system.
Assuredly Plato thinks that the souls of mortals cannot
always be in their bodies, but must necessarily be dismissed
by death; and, on the other hand, he thinks that without
bodies they cannot endure for ever, but with ceaseless alternation
pass from life to death, and from death to life. This
difference, however, he sets between wise men and the rest,
that they are carried after death to the stars, that each man
may repose for a while in a star suitable for him, and may
thence return to the labours and miseries of mortals when he
has become oblivious of his former misery, and possessed with
the desire of being embodied. Those, again, who have lived
foolishly transmigrate into bodies fit for them, whether human
or bestial. Thus he has appointed even the good and wise
souls to a very hard lot indeed, since they do not receive
such bodies as they might always and even immortally inhabit,
but such only as they can neither permanently retain
nor enjoy eternal purity without. Of this notion of Plato's,
we have in a former book already said<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> that Porphyry was
ashamed in the light of these Christian times, so that he not
only emancipated human souls from a destiny in the bodies of
beasts, but also contended for the liberation of the souls of
the wise from all bodily ties, so that, escaping from all flesh,
they might, as bare and blessed souls, dwell with the Father
time without end. And that he might not seem to be outbid
by Christ's promise of life everlasting to His saints, he also
established purified souls in endless felicity, without return to
their former woes; but, that he might contradict Christ, he
denies the resurrection of incorruptible bodies, and maintains
that these souls will live eternally, not only without earthly
bodies, but without any bodies at all. And yet, whatever he
meant by this teaching, he at least did not teach that these
souls should offer no religious observance to the gods who
dwelt in bodies. And why did he not, unless because he did
not believe that the souls, even though separate from the body,
were superior to those gods? Wherefore, if these philosophers
will not dare (as I think they will not) to set human souls
above the gods who are most blessed, and yet are tied eternally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
to their bodies, why do they find that absurd which the
Christian faith preaches,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> namely, that our first parents were
so created that, if they had not sinned, they would not have
been dismissed from their bodies by any death, but would
have been endowed with immortality as the reward of their
obedience, and would have lived eternally with their bodies;
and further, that the saints will in the resurrection inhabit
those very bodies in which they have here toiled, but in such
sort that neither shall any corruption or unwieldiness be
suffered to attach to their flesh, nor any grief or trouble to
cloud their felicity?</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>That the flesh now resting in peace shall be raised to a perfection not
enjoyed by the flesh of our first parents.</i></p>

<p>Thus the souls of departed saints are not affected by the
death which dismisses them from their bodies, because their
flesh rests in hope, no matter what indignities it receives after
sensation is gone. For they do not desire that their bodies be
forgotten, as Plato thinks fit, but rather, because they remember
what has been promised by Him who deceives no man, and
who gave them security for the safe keeping even of the hairs
of their head, they with a longing patience wait in hope of the
resurrection of their bodies, in which they have suffered many
hardships, and are now to suffer never again. For if they did
not "hate their own flesh," when it, with its native infirmity,
opposed their will, and had to be constrained by the spiritual
law, how much more shall they love it, when it shall even
itself have become spiritual! For as, when the spirit serves
the flesh, it is fitly called carnal, so, when the flesh serves the
spirit, it will justly be called spiritual. Not that it is converted
into spirit, as some fancy from the words, "It is sown in corruption,
it is raised in incorruption,"<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> but because it is subject
to the spirit with a perfect and marvellous readiness of
obedience, and responds in all things to the will that has entered
on immortality,&mdash;all reluctance, all corruption, and all slowness
being removed. For the body will not only be better than it
was here in its best estate of health, but it will surpass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
bodies of our first parents ere they sinned. For, though they
were not to die unless they should sin, yet they used food as
men do now, their bodies not being as yet spiritual, but animal
only. And though they decayed not with years, nor drew
nearer to death,&mdash;a condition secured to them in God's marvellous
grace by the tree of life, which grew along with the
forbidden tree in the midst of Paradise,&mdash;yet they took other
nourishment, though not of that one tree, which was interdicted
not because it was itself bad, but for the sake of commending
a pure and simple obedience, which is the great virtue
of the rational creature set under the Creator as his Lord. For,
though no evil thing was touched, yet if a thing forbidden
was touched, the very disobedience was sin. They were, then,
nourished by other fruit, which they took that their animal
bodies might not suffer the discomfort of hunger or thirst; but
they tasted the tree of life, that death might not steal upon
them from any quarter, and that they might not, spent with
age, decay. Other fruits were, so to speak, their nourishment,
but this their sacrament. So that the tree of life would seem
to have been in the terrestrial Paradise what the wisdom of
God is in the spiritual, of which it is written, "She is a tree
of life to them that lay hold upon her."<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>21. <i>Of Paradise, that it can be understood in a spiritual sense without sacrificing
the historic truth of the narrative regarding the real place.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>On this account some allegorize all that concerns Paradise
itself, where the first men, the parents of the human race, are,
according to the truth of holy Scripture, recorded to have been;
and they understand all its trees and fruit-bearing plants as
virtues and habits of life, as if they had no existence in the
external world, but were only so spoken of or related for the
sake of spiritual meanings. As if there could not be a real
terrestrial Paradise! As if there never existed these two
women, Sarah and Hagar, nor the two sons who were born
to Abraham, the one of the bond woman, the other of the free,
because the apostle says that in them the two covenants were
prefigured; or as if water never flowed from the rock when
Moses struck it, because therein Christ can be seen in a figure,
as the same apostle says, "Now that rock was Christ!"<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
one, then, denies that Paradise may signify the life of the
blessed; its four rivers, the four virtues, prudence, fortitude,
temperance, and justice; its trees, all useful knowledge; its
fruits, the customs of the godly; its tree of life, wisdom herself,
the mother of all good; and the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, the experience of a broken commandment. The
punishment which God appointed was in itself a just, and therefore
a good thing; but man's experience of it is not good.</p>

<p>These things can also and more profitably be understood of
the Church, so that they become prophetic foreshadowings of
things to come. Thus Paradise is the Church, as it is called in
the Canticles;<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> the four rivers of Paradise are the four gospels;
the fruit-trees the saints, and the fruit their works; the tree
of life is the holy of holies, Christ; the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, the will's free choice. For if man despise
the will of God, he can only destroy himself; and so he learns
the difference between consecrating himself to the common
good and revelling in his own. For he who loves himself is
abandoned to himself, in order that, being overwhelmed with
fears and sorrows, he may cry, if there be yet soul in him to
feel his ills, in the words of the psalm, "My soul is cast down
within me,"<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> and when chastened, may say, "Because of his
strength I will wait upon Thee."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> These and similar allegorical
interpretations may be suitably put upon Paradise without
giving offence to any one, while yet we believe the strict
truth of the history, confirmed by its circumstantial narrative
of facts.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>


<p class="center">22. <i>That the bodies of the saints shall after the resurrection be spiritual, and
yet flesh shall not be changed into spirit.</i></p>

<p>The bodies of the righteous, then, such as they shall be in
the resurrection, shall need neither any fruit to preserve them
from dying of disease or the wasting decay of old age, nor any
other physical nourishment to allay the cravings of hunger or
of thirst; for they shall be invested with so sure and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
way inviolable an immortality, that they shall not eat save
when they choose, nor be under the necessity of eating, while
they enjoy the power of doing so. For so also was it with
the angels who presented themselves to the eye and touch of
men, not because they could do no otherwise, but because
they were able and desirous to suit themselves to men by a
kind of manhood ministry. For neither are we to suppose,
when men receive them as guests, that the angels eat only in
appearance, though to any who did not know them to be
angels they might seem to eat from the same necessity as ourselves.
So these words spoken in the Book of Tobit, "You
saw me eat, but you saw it but in vision;"<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> that is, you thought
I took food as you do for the sake of refreshing my body.
But if in the case of the angels another opinion seems more
capable of defence, certainly our faith leaves no room to doubt
regarding our Lord Himself, that even after His resurrection,
and when now in spiritual but yet real flesh, He ate and drank
with His disciples; for not the power, but the need, of eating
and drinking is taken from these bodies. And so they will
be spiritual, not because they shall cease to be bodies, but
because they shall subsist by the quickening spirit.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>What we are to understand by the animal and spiritual body; or of those
who die in Adam, and of those who are made alive in Christ.</i></p>

<p>For as those bodies of ours, that have a living soul, though
not as yet a quickening spirit, are called soul-informed bodies,
and yet are not souls but bodies, so also those bodies are
called spiritual,&mdash;yet God forbid we should therefore suppose
them to be spirits and not bodies,&mdash;which, being quickened by
the Spirit, have the substance, but not the unwieldiness and corruption
of flesh. Man will then be not earthly but heavenly,&mdash;not
because the body will not be that very body which was
made of earth, but because by its heavenly endowment it will
be a fit inhabitant of heaven, and this not by losing its nature,
but by changing its quality. The first man, of the earth
earthy, was made a living soul, not a quickening spirit,&mdash;which
rank was reserved for him as the reward of obedience. And
therefore his body, which required meat and drink to satisfy
hunger and thirst, and which had no absolute and indestructible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
immortality, but by means of the tree of life warded off
the necessity of dying, and was thus maintained in the flower
of youth,&mdash;this body, I say, was doubtless not spiritual, but
animal; and yet it would not have died but that it provoked
God's threatened vengeance by offending. And though sustenance
was not denied him even outside Paradise, yet, being forbidden
the tree of life, he was delivered over to the wasting of
time, at least in respect of that life which, had he not sinned,
he might have retained perpetually in Paradise, though only
in an animal body, till such time as it became spiritual in
acknowledgment of his obedience.</p>

<p>Wherefore, although we understand that this manifest death,
which consists in the separation of soul and body, was also
signified by God when He said, "In the day thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die,"<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> it ought not on that account to
seem absurd that they were not dismissed from the body on that
very day on which they took the forbidden and death-bringing
fruit. For certainly on that very day their nature was altered
for the worse and vitiated, and by their most just banishment
from the tree of life they were involved in the necessity even
of bodily death, in which necessity we are born. And therefore
the apostle does not say, "The body indeed is doomed to
die on account of sin," but he says, "The body indeed is
dead because of sin." Then he adds, "But if the Spirit of
Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He
that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Then
accordingly shall the body become a quickening spirit which
is now a living soul; and yet the apostle calls it "dead," because
already it lies under the necessity of dying. But in
Paradise it was so made a living soul, though not a quickening
spirit, that it could not properly be called dead, for, save
through the commission of sin, it could not come under the
power of death. Now, since God by the words, "Adam, where
art thou?" pointed to the death of the soul, which results
when He abandons it, and since in the words, "Earth thou
art, and unto earth shalt thou return,"<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> He signified the
death of the body, which results when the soul departs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
it, we are led, therefore, to believe that He said nothing of
the second death, wishing it to be kept hidden, and reserving
it for the New Testament dispensation, in which it is most
plainly revealed. And this He did in order that, first of all,
it might be evident that this first death, which is common to
all, was the result of that sin which in one man became common
to all.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But the second death is not common to all, those
being excepted who were "called according to His purpose.
For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born
among many brethren."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Those the grace of God has,
by a Mediator, delivered from the second death.</p>

<p>Thus the apostle states that the first man was made in an
animal body. For, wishing to distinguish the animal body
which now is from the spiritual, which is to be in the resurrection,
he says, "It is sown in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption: it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory:
it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power: it is sown a
natural body, it is raised a spiritual body." Then, to prove
this, he goes on, "There is a natural body, and there is a
spiritual body." And to show what the animated body is,
he says, "Thus it was written, The first man Adam was made
a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
He wished thus to show what the animated body is, though
Scripture did not say of the first man Adam, when his soul
was created by the breath of God, "Man was made in an
animated body," but "Man was made a living soul."<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> By
these words, therefore, "The first man was made a living soul,"
the apostle wishes man's animated body to be understood.
But how he wishes the spiritual body to be understood he
shows when he adds, "But the last Adam was made a
quickening spirit," plainly referring to Christ, who has so
risen from the dead that He cannot die any more. He then
goes on to say, "But that was not first which is spiritual,
but that which is natural; and afterward that which is
spiritual." And here he much more clearly asserts that he
referred to the animal body when he said that the first man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
was made a living soul, and to the spiritual when he said that
the last man was made a quickening spirit. The animal
body is the first, being such as the first Adam had, and which
would not have died had he not sinned, being such also as
we now have, its nature being changed and vitiated by sin to
the extent of bringing us under the necessity of death, and
being such as even Christ condescended first of all to assume,
not indeed of necessity, but of choice; but afterwards comes
the spiritual body, which already is worn by anticipation by
Christ as our head, and will be worn by His members in the
resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p>Then the apostle subjoins a notable difference between these
two men, saying, "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the
second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such
are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such
are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the
image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the
heavenly."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> So he elsewhere says, "As many of you as have
been baptized into Christ have put on Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> but in very
deed this shall be accomplished when that which is animal in
us by our birth shall have become spiritual in our resurrection.
For, to use his words again, "We are saved by hope."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
Now we bear the image of the earthly man by the propagation
of sin and death, which pass on us by ordinary generation;
but we bear the image of the heavenly by the grace of
pardon and life eternal, which regeneration confers upon us
through the Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.
And He is the heavenly Man of Paul's passage, because He
came from heaven to be clothed with a body of earthly mortality,
that He might clothe it with heavenly immortality.
And he calls others heavenly, because by grace they become
His members, that, together with them, He may become one
Christ, as head and body. In the same epistle he puts this yet
more clearly: "Since by man came death, by Man came also
the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even
so in Christ shall all be made alive,"<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>&mdash;that is to say, in a
spiritual body which shall be made a quickening spirit. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
that all who die in Adam shall be members of Christ,&mdash;for the
great majority shall be punished in eternal death,&mdash;but he
uses the word "all" in both clauses, because, as no one dies
in an animal body except in Adam, so no one is quickened
a spiritual body save in Christ. We are not, then, by any
means to suppose that we shall in the resurrection have such
a body as the first man had before he sinned, nor that the
words, "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy,"
are to be understood of that which was brought about by sin;
for we are not to think that Adam had a spiritual body before
he fell, and that, in punishment of his sin, it was changed into
an animal body. If this be thought, small heed has been
given to the words of so great a teacher, who says, "There is
a natural body, there is also a spiritual body; as it is written,
The first man Adam was made a living soul." Was it after
sin he was made so? or was not this the primal condition
of man from which the blessed apostle selects his testimony
to show what the animal body is?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>24. <i>How we must understand that breathing of God by which "the first man
was made a living soul," and that also by which the Lord conveyed His
Spirit to His disciples when He said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some have hastily supposed from the words, "God breathed
into Adam's nostrils the breath of life, and man became a
living soul,"<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> that a soul was not then first given to man, but
that the soul already given was quickened by the Holy Ghost.
They are encouraged in this supposition by the fact that the
Lord Jesus after His resurrection breathed on His disciples,
and said, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> From this they
suppose that the same thing was effected in either case, as
if the evangelist had gone on to say, And they became living
souls. But if he had made this addition, we should only
understand that the Spirit is in some way the life of souls,
and that without Him reasonable souls must be accounted
dead, though their bodies seem to live before our eyes. But
that this was not what happened when man was created, the
very words of the narrative sufficiently show: "And God made
man dust of the earth;" which some have thought to render
more clearly by the words, "And God formed man of the clay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
of the earth." For it had before been said that "there went
up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the
ground,"<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> in order that the reference to clay, formed of this
moisture and dust, might be understood. For on this verse
there immediately follows the announcement, "And God
created man dust of the earth;" so those Greek manuscripts
have it from which this passage has been translated into
Latin. But whether one prefers to read "<i>created</i>" or "<i>formed</i>,"
where the Greek reads &#7956;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957;, is of little importance; yet
"<i>formed</i>" is the better rendering. But those who preferred
"created" thought they thus avoided the ambiguity arising
from the fact, that in the Latin language the usage obtains
that those are said to form a thing who frame some feigned
and fictitious thing. This man, then, who was created of the
dust of the earth, or of the moistened dust or clay,&mdash;this "dust
of the earth" (that I may use the express words of Scripture)
was made, as the apostle teaches, an animated body when he
received a soul. This man, he says, "was made a living soul;"
that is, this fashioned dust was made a living soul.</p>

<p>They say, Already he had a soul, else he would not be
called a man; for man is not a body alone, nor a soul alone,
but a being composed of both. This, indeed, is true, that the
soul is not the whole man, but the better part of man; the
body not the whole, but the inferior part of man; and that
then, when both are joined, they receive the name of man,&mdash;which,
however, they do not severally lose even when we
speak of them singly. For who is prohibited from saying, in
colloquial usage, "That man is dead, and is now at rest or in
torment," though this can be spoken only of the soul; or "He
is buried in such and such a place," though this refers only
to the body? Will they say that Scripture follows no such
usage? On the contrary, it so thoroughly adopts it, that even
while a man is alive, and body and soul are united, it calls
each of them singly by the name "<i>man</i>," speaking of the soul
as the "inward man," and of the body as the "outward man,"<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>
as if there were two men, though both together are indeed but
one. But we must understand in what sense man is said to
be in the image of God, and is yet dust, and to return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
dust. The former is spoken of the rational soul, which God
by His breathing, or, to speak more appropriately, by His inspiration,
conveyed to man, that is, to his body; but the latter
refers to his body, which God formed of the dust, and to
which a soul was given, that it might become a living body,
that is, that man might become a living soul.</p>

<p>Wherefore, when our Lord breathed on His disciples, and
said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," He certainly wished it to
be understood that the Holy Ghost was not only the Spirit
of the Father, but of the only-begotten Son Himself. For
the same Spirit is, indeed, the Spirit of the Father and of
the Son, making with them the trinity of Father, Son, and
Spirit, not a creature, but the Creator. For neither was that
material breath which proceeded from the mouth of His flesh
the very substance and nature of the Holy Spirit, but rather
the intimation, as I said, that the Holy Spirit was common
to the Father and to the Son; for they have not each a separate
Spirit, but both one and the same. Now this Spirit is
always spoken of in sacred Scripture by the Greek word
&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;, as the Lord, too, named Him in the place cited when
He gave Him to His disciples, and intimated the gift by the
breathing of His lips; and there does not occur to me any
place in the whole Scriptures where He is otherwise named.
But in this passage where it is said, "And the Lord formed
man dust of the earth, and breathed, or inspired, into his face
the breath of life;" the Greek has not &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;, the usual word
for the Holy Spirit, but &#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053;, a word more frequently used
of the creature than of the Creator; and for this reason some
Latin interpreters have preferred to render it by "breath"
rather than "spirit." For this word occurs also in the Greek
in Isa. lvii. 16, where God says, "I have made all breath,"
meaning, doubtless, all souls. Accordingly, this word &#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053; is
sometimes rendered "breath," sometimes "spirit," sometimes
"inspiration," sometimes "aspiration," sometimes "soul," even
when it is used of God. &#928;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;, on the other hand, is uniformly
rendered "spirit," whether of man, of whom the apostle says,
"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit
of man which is in him?"<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> or of beast, as in the book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
Solomon, "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward,
and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the
earth?"<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> or of that physical spirit which is called wind, for
so the Psalmist calls it: "Fire and hail; snow and vapours;
stormy wind;"<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> or of the uncreated Creator Spirit, of whom
the Lord said in the gospel, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost,"
indicating the gift by the breathing of His mouth; and when
He says, "Go ye and baptize all nations in the name of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,"<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> words which very
expressly and excellently commend the Trinity; and where it
is said, "God is a Spirit;"<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and in very many other places
of the sacred writings. In all these quotations from Scripture
we do not find in the Greek the word &#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053; used, but
&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;, and in the Latin, not <i>flatus</i>, but <i>spiritus</i>. Wherefore,
referring again to that place where it is written, "He inspired,"
or, to speak more properly, "breathed into his face the breath
of life," even though the Greek had not used &#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053; (as it has)
but &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;, it would not on that account necessarily follow
that the Creator Spirit, who in the Trinity is distinctively
called the Holy Ghost, was meant, since, as has been said, it
is plain that &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945; is used not only of the Creator, but also
of the creature.</p>

<p>But, say they, when the Scripture used the word "spirit,"<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
it would not have added "of life" unless it meant us to
understand the Holy Spirit; nor, when it said, "Man became
a soul," would it also have inserted the word "living" unless
that life of the soul were signified which is imparted to it
from above by the gift of God. For, seeing that the soul by
itself has a proper life of its own, what need, they ask, was
there of adding living, save only to show that the life which
is given it by the Holy Spirit was meant? What is this but
to fight strenuously for their own conjectures, while they carelessly
neglect the teaching of Scripture? Without troubling
themselves much, they might have found in a preceding page
of this very book of Genesis the words, "Let the earth bring
forth the living soul,"<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> when all the terrestrial animals were
created. Then at a slight interval, but still in the same book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
was it impossible for them to notice this verse, "All in whose
nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land,
died," by which it was signified that all the animals which
lived on the earth had perished in the deluge? If, then, we
find that Scripture is accustomed to speak both of the "living
soul" and the "spirit of life" even in reference to beasts; and
if in this place, where it is said, "All things which have the
spirit of life," the word &#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053;, not &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;, is used; why may
we not say, What need was there to add "living," since the
soul cannot exist without being alive? or, What need to add
"of life" after the word spirit? But we understand that Scripture
used these expressions in its ordinary style so long as it
speaks of animals, that is, animated bodies, in which the soul
serves as the residence of sensation; but when man is spoken
of, we forget the ordinary and established usage of Scripture,
whereby it signifies that man received a rational soul, which
was not produced out of the waters and the earth like the
other living creatures, but was created by the breath of God.
Yet this creation was so ordered that the human soul should
live in an animal body, like those other animals of which the
Scripture said, "Let the earth produce every living soul,"
and regarding which it again says that in them is the breath
of life, where the word &#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053; and not &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945; is used in the
Greek, and where certainly not the Holy Spirit, but their
spirit, is signified under that name.</p>

<p>But, again, they object that breath is understood to have
been emitted from the mouth of God; and if we believe that
is the soul, we must consequently acknowledge it to be of the
same substance, and equal to that wisdom, which says, "I
come out of the mouth of the Most High."<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Wisdom, indeed,
does not say it was breathed out of the mouth of God, but
proceeded out of it. But as we are able, when we breathe,
to make a breath, not of our own human nature, but of the
surrounding air, which we inhale and exhale as we draw our
breath and breathe again, so almighty God was able to make
breath, not of His own nature, nor of the creature beneath
Him, but even of nothing; and this breath, when He communicated
it to man's body, He is most appropriately said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
have breathed or inspired,&mdash;the Immaterial breathing it also
immaterial, but the Immutable not also the immutable; for
it was created, He uncreated. Yet, that these persons who
are forward to quote Scripture, and yet know not the usages
of its language, may know that not only what is equal and
consubstantial with God is said to proceed out of His mouth,
let them hear or read what God says: "So then because thou
art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out
of my mouth."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>There is no ground, then, for our objecting, when the apostle
so expressly distinguishes the animal body from the spiritual,&mdash;that
is to say, the body in which we now are from that in
which we are to be. He says, "It is sown a natural body, it
is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there
is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam
was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening
spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but
that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that
are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that
are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Of all which
words of his we have previously spoken. The animal body,
accordingly, in which the apostle says that the first man
Adam was made, was not so made that it could not die at
all, but so that it should not die unless he should have sinned.
That body, indeed, which shall be made spiritual and immortal
by the quickening Spirit shall not be able to die at all; as
the soul has been created immortal, and therefore, although by
sin it may be said to die, and does lose a certain life of its
own, namely, the Spirit of God, by whom it was enabled to
live wisely and blessedly, yet it does not cease living a kind
of life, though a miserable, because it is immortal by creation.
So, too, the rebellious angels, though by sinning they did in
a sense die, because they forsook God, the Fountain of life,
which while they drank they were able to live wisely and
well, yet they could not so die as to utterly cease living and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
feeling, for they are immortals by creation. And so, after the
final judgment, they shall be hurled into the second death,
and not even there be deprived of life or of sensation, but
shall suffer torment. But those men who have been embraced
by God's grace, and are become the fellow-citizens of the holy
angels who have continued in bliss, shall never more either
sin or die, being endued with spiritual bodies; yet, being
clothed with immortality, such as the angels enjoy, of which
they cannot be divested even by sinning, the nature of their
flesh shall continue the same, but all carnal corruption and
unwieldiness shall be removed.</p>

<p>There remains a question which must be discussed, and,
by the help of the Lord God of truth, solved: If the motion
of concupiscence in the unruly members of our first parents
arose out of their sin, and only when the divine grace deserted
them; and if it was on that occasion that their eyes were
opened to see, or, more exactly, notice their nakedness, and
that they covered their shame because the shameless motion
of their members was not subject to their will,&mdash;how, then,
would they have begotten children had they remained sinless
as they were created? But as this book must be concluded,
and so large a question cannot be summarily disposed of, we
may relegate it to the following book, in which it will be more
conveniently treated.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

relates that the image of Cybele was brought to Rome the day before the ides

seems, had to be washed in the stream Almon, a tributary of the Tiber, before
being placed in the temple of Victory; and each year, as the festival returned, the
washing was repeated with much pomp at the same spot. Hence Lucan's line
(i. 600), 'Et lotam parvo revocant Almone Cybelen,' and the elegant verses of
Ovid, <i>Fast.</i> iv. 337 et seq.</p></div>

Proclus, are at one in recognising in God three principles or hypostases: 1st,
the One or the Good, which is the Father; 2d, the Intelligence or Word, which
is the Son; 3d, the Soul, which is the universal principle of life. But as to
the nature and order of these hypostases, the Alexandrians are no longer at one
with the school of Athens. On the very subtle differences between the Trinity
of Plotinus and that of Porphyry, consult M. Jules Simon, ii. 110, and M.

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>AUGUSTINE AGAIN TREATS OF THE SIN OF THE FIRST MAN, AND TEACHES THAT
IT IS THE CAUSE OF THE CARNAL LIFE AND VICIOUS AFFECTIONS OF MAN.
ESPECIALLY HE PROVES THAT THE SHAME WHICH ACCOMPANIES LUST IS THE
JUST PUNISHMENT OF THAT DISOBEDIENCE, AND INQUIRES HOW MAN, IF HE
HAD NOT SINNED, WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE WITHOUT LUST TO PROPAGATE
HIS KIND.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>1. <i>That the disobedience of the first man would have plunged all men into the
endless misery of the second death, had not the grace of God rescued many.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We have already stated in the preceding books that God,
desiring not only that the human race might be able
by their similarity of nature to associate with one another,
but also that they might be bound together in harmony and
peace by the ties of relationship, was pleased to derive all
men from one individual, and created man with such a
nature that the members of the race should not have died,
had not the two first (of whom the one was created out of
nothing, and the other out of him) merited this by their disobedience;
for by them so great a sin was committed, that by
it the human nature was altered for the worse, and was transmitted
also to their posterity, liable to sin and subject to
death. And the kingdom of death so reigned over men, that
the deserved penalty of sin would have hurled all headlong
even into the second death, of which there is no end, had not
the undeserved grace of God saved some therefrom. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
thus it has come to pass, that though there are very many
and great nations all over the earth, whose rites and customs,
speech, arms, and dress, are distinguished by marked differences,
yet there are no more than two kinds of human society,
which we may justly call two cities, according to the language
of our Scriptures. The one consists of those who wish to live
after the flesh, the other of those who wish to live after the
spirit; and when they severally achieve what they wish, they
live in peace, each after their kind.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of carnal life, which is to be understood not only of living in bodily indulgence,
but also of living in the vices of the inner man.</i></p>

<p>First, we must see what it is to live after the flesh, and what
to live after the spirit. For any one who either does not
recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred
Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose
that the Epicurean philosophers live after the flesh, because
they place man's highest good in bodily pleasure; and that
those others do so who have been of opinion that in some
form or other bodily good is man's supreme good; and that
the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or philosophizing
on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot
delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily
sensations: and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place
the supreme good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for
what is man's soul, if not spirit? But in the sense of the
divine Scripture both are proved to live after the flesh. For
by flesh it means not only the body of a terrestrial and mortal
animal, as when it says, "All flesh is not the same flesh,
but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of
beasts, another of fishes, another of birds,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but it uses this
word in many other significations; and among these various
usages, a frequent one is to use flesh for man himself, the
nature of man taking the part for the whole, as in the words,
"By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified;"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
for what does he mean here by "no flesh" but "no man?"
And this, indeed, he shortly after says more plainly: "No man
shall be justified by the law;"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in the Epistle to the
Galatians, "Knowing that a man is not justified by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
works of the law." And so we understand the words, "And
the Word was made flesh,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;that is, man, which some not
accepting in its right sense, have supposed that Christ had not
a human soul.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> For as the whole is used for the part in the
words of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel, "They have taken
away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
by which she meant only the flesh of Christ, which she supposed
had been taken from the tomb where it had been
buried, so the part is used for the whole, flesh being named,
while man is referred to, as in the quotations above cited.</p>

<p>Since, then, Scripture uses the word flesh in many ways,
which there is not time to collect and investigate, if we are to
ascertain what it is to live after the flesh (which is certainly
evil, though the nature of flesh is not itself evil), we must
carefully examine that passage of the epistle which the
Apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians, in which he says, "Now
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery,
fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This whole passage of the apostolic
epistle being considered, so far as it bears on the matter in
hand, will be sufficient to answer the question, what it is to
live after the flesh. For among the works of the flesh which
he said were manifest, and which he cited for condemnation,
we find not only those which concern the pleasure of the
flesh, as fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, drunkenness,
revellings, but also those which, though they be remote from
fleshly pleasure, reveal the vices of the soul. For who does
not see that idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, variance, emulations,
wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, are vices rather of the
soul than of the flesh? For it is quite possible for a man to
abstain from fleshly pleasures for the sake of idolatry or some
heretical error; and yet, even when he does so, he is proved by
this apostolic authority to be living after the flesh; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
abstaining from fleshly pleasure, he is proved to be practising
damnable works of the flesh. Who that has enmity has it
not in his soul? or who would say to his enemy, or to the
man he thinks his enemy, You have a bad flesh towards me,
and not rather, You have a bad spirit towards me? In fine,
if any one heard of what I may call "carnalities," he would
not fail to attribute them to the carnal part of man; so no
one doubts that "animosities" belong to the soul of man.
Why then does the doctor of the Gentiles in faith and verity
call all these and similar things works of the flesh, unless
because, by that mode of speech whereby the part is used for
the whole, he means us to understand by the word flesh the
man himself?</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap143"></a>3. <i>That sin is caused not by the flesh, but by the soul, and that the corruption
contracted from sin is not sin, but sin's punishment.</i></p>

<p>But if any one says that the flesh is the cause of all vices
and ill conduct, inasmuch as the soul lives wickedly only
because it is moved by the flesh, it is certain he has not
carefully considered the whole nature of man. For "the
corruptible body, indeed, weigheth down the soul."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Whence,
too, the apostle, speaking of this corruptible body, of which
he had shortly before said, "though our outward man perish,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
says, "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan,
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is
from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not be found
naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being
burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed
upon, that mortality might be swallowed up in life."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We
are then burdened with this corruptible body; but knowing
that the cause of this burdensomeness is not the nature and
substance of the body, but its corruption, we do not desire to
be deprived of the body, but to be clothed with its immortality.
For then, also, there will be a body, but it shall no
longer be a burden, being no longer corruptible. At present,
then, "the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the

many things," nevertheless they are in error who suppose that
all the evils of the soul proceed from the body.</p>

<p>Virgil, indeed, seems to express the sentiments of Plato in
the beautiful lines, where he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>but though he goes on to mention the four most common
mental emotions,&mdash;desire, fear, joy, sorrow,&mdash;with the intention

<p>yet we believe quite otherwise. For the corruption of the
body, which weighs down the soul, is not the cause but the
punishment of the first sin; and it was not the corruptible
flesh that made the soul sinful, but the sinful soul that made
the flesh corruptible. And though from this corruption of
the flesh there arise certain incitements to vice, and indeed
vicious desires, yet we must not attribute to the flesh all
the vices of a wicked life, in case we thereby clear the devil
of all these, for he has no flesh. For though we cannot call
the devil a fornicator or drunkard, or ascribe to him any
sensual indulgence (though he is the secret instigator and
prompter of those who sin in these ways), yet he is exceedingly
proud and envious. And this viciousness has so possessed
him, that on account of it he is reserved in chains of
darkness to everlasting punishment.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Now these vices, which
have dominion over the devil, the apostle attributes to the
flesh, which certainly the devil has not. For he says
"hatred, variance, emulations, strife, envying" are the works
of the flesh; and of all these evils pride is the origin and
head, and it rules in the devil though he has no flesh. For
who shows more hatred to the saints? who is more at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
variance with them? who more envious, bitter, and jealous?
And since he exhibits all these works, though he has no flesh,
how are they works of the flesh, unless because they are the
works of man, who is, as I said, spoken of under the name of
flesh? For it is not by having flesh, which the devil has not,
but by living according to himself,&mdash;that is, according to
man,&mdash;that man became like the devil. For the devil too,
wished to live according to himself when he did not abide in
the truth; so that when he lied, this was not of God, but of
himself, who is not only a liar, but the father of lies, he being
the first who lied, and the originator of lying as of sin.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>What it is to live according to man, and what to live according to God.</i></p>

<p>When, therefore, man lives according to man, not according
to God, he is like the devil. Because not even an angel
might live according to an angel, but only according to God,
if he was to abide in the truth, and speak God's truth and
not his own lie. And of man, too, the same apostle says in
another place, "If the truth of God hath more abounded
through my lie;"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;"my lie," he said, and "God's truth."
When, then, a man lives according to the truth, he lives not
according to himself, but according to God; for He was
God who said, "I am the truth."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> When, therefore, man
lives according to himself,&mdash;that is, according to man, not
according to God,&mdash;assuredly he lives according to a lie; not
that man himself is a lie, for God is his author and creator,
who is certainly not the author and creator of a lie, but
because man was made upright, that he might not live according
to himself, but according to Him that made him,&mdash;in other
words, that he might do His will and not his own; and not to
live as he was made to live, that is a lie. For he certainly
desires to be blessed even by not living so that he may be
blessed. And what is a lie if this desire be not? Wherefore
it is not without meaning said that all sin is a lie. For
no sin is committed save by that desire or will by which we
desire that it be well with us, and shrink from it being ill
with us. That, therefore, is a lie which we do in order that
it may be well with us, but which makes us more miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
than we were. And why is this, but because the source of
man's happiness lies only in God, whom he abandons when
he sins, and not in himself, by living according to whom he
sins?</p>

<p>In enunciating this proposition of ours, then, that because
some live according to the flesh and others according to the
spirit there have arisen two diverse and conflicting cities,
we might equally well have said, "because some live according
to man, others according to God." For Paul says very
plainly to the Corinthians, "For whereas there is among you
envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to
man?"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> So that to walk according to man and to be carnal
are the same; for by <i>flesh</i>, that is, by a part of man, man
is meant. For before he said that those same persons were
animal whom afterwards he calls carnal, saying, "For what
man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no
man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the
spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we
might know the things which are freely given to us of God.
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
spiritual things with spiritual. But the animal man
perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
foolishness unto him."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is to men of this kind, then, that
is, to animal men, he shortly after says, "And I, brethren, could
not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
And this is to be interpreted by the same usage, a part being
taken for the whole. For both the soul and the flesh, the
component parts of man, can be used to signify the whole
man; and so the animal man and the carnal man are not two
different things, but one and the same thing, viz. man living
according to man. In the same way it is nothing else than
men that are meant either in the words, "By the deeds of
the law there shall no <i>flesh</i> be justified;"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or in the words,
"Seventy-five <i>souls</i> went down into Egypt with Jacob."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In
the one passage, "no flesh" signifies "no man;" and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
other, by "seventy-five souls" seventy-five men are meant.
And the expression, "not in words which man's wisdom
teacheth," might equally be "not in words which fleshly
wisdom teacheth;" and the expression, "ye walk according to
man," might be "according to the flesh." And this is still
more apparent in the words which followed: "For while one
saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not
men?" The same thing which he had before expressed by
"ye are animal," "ye are carnal," he now expresses by "ye
are men;" that is, ye live according to man, not according to
God, for if you lived according to Him, you should be gods.</p>

<p><a id="chap145"></a>5. <i>That the opinion of the Platonists regarding the nature of body and soul is
not so censurable as that of the Manichæans, but that even it is objectionable,
because it ascribes the origin of vices to the nature of the flesh.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There is no need, therefore, that in our sins and vices we
accuse the nature of the flesh to the injury of the Creator, for
in its own kind and degree the flesh is good; but to desert the
Creator good, and live according to the created good, is not good,
whether a man choose to live according to the flesh, or according
to the soul, or according to the whole human nature, which
is composed of flesh and soul, and which is therefore spoken of
either by the name flesh alone, or by the name soul alone. For
he who extols the nature of the soul as the chief good, and condemns
the nature of the flesh as if it were evil, assuredly is
fleshly both in his love of the soul and hatred of the flesh; for
these his feelings arise from human fancy, not from divine
truth. The Platonists, indeed, are not so foolish as, with the
Manichæans, to detest our present bodies as an evil nature;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
for they attribute all the elements of which this visible and
tangible world is compacted, with all their qualities, to God
their Creator. Nevertheless, from the death-infected members
and earthly construction of the body they believe the soul is so
affected, that there are thus originated in it the diseases of
desires, and fears, and joy, and sorrow, under which four perturbations,
as Cicero<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> calls them, or passions, as most prefer
to name them with the Greeks, is included the whole viciousness
of human life. But if this be so, how is it that Æneas
in Virgil, when he had heard from his father in Hades that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the souls should return to bodies, expresses surprise at this
declaration, and exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O father! and can thought conceive<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That happy souls this realm would leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And seek the upper sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With sluggish clay to reunite?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This direful longing for the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Whence comes it, say, and why?"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This direful longing, then, does it still exist even in that
boasted purity of the disembodied spirits, and does it still
proceed from the death-infected members and earthly limbs?
Does he not assert that, when they begin to long to return
to the body, they have already been delivered from all these
so-called pestilences of the body? From which we gather
that, were this endlessly alternating purification and defilement
of departing and returning souls as true as it is most certainly
false, yet it could not be averred that all culpable and vicious
motions of the soul originate in the earthly body; for, on their
own showing, "this direful longing," to use the words of their
noble exponent, is so extraneous to the body, that it moves
the soul that is purged of all bodily taint, and is existing
apart from any body whatever, and moves it, moreover, to be
embodied again. So that even they themselves acknowledge
that the soul is not only moved to desire, fear, joy, sorrow, by
the flesh, but that it can also be agitated with these emotions
at its own instance.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap146"></a>6. <i>Of the character of the human will which makes the affections of the soul
right or wrong.</i></p>

<p>But the character of the human will is of moment; because,
if it is wrong, these motions of the soul will be wrong, but if
it is right, they will be not merely blameless, but even praiseworthy.
For the will is in them all; yea, none of them is
anything else than will. For what are desire and joy but a
volition of consent to the things we wish? And what are
fear and sadness but a volition of aversion from the things
which we do not wish? But when consent takes the form of
seeking to possess the things we wish, this is called desire;
and when consent takes the form of enjoying the things we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wish, this is called joy. In like manner, when we turn with
aversion from that which we do not wish to happen, this
volition is termed fear; and when we turn away from that
which has happened against our will, this act of will is called
sorrow. And generally in respect of all that we seek or shun, as
a man's will is attracted or repelled, so it is changed and turned
into these different affections. Wherefore the man who lives
according to God, and not according to man, ought to be a lover
of good, and therefore a hater of evil. And since no one is
evil by nature, but whoever is evil is evil by vice, he who
lives according to God ought to cherish towards evil men a
perfect hatred, so that he shall neither hate the man because
of his vice, nor love the vice because of the man, but hate
the vice and love the man. For the vice being cursed, all
that ought to be loved, and nothing that ought to be hated,
will remain.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That the words love and regard</i> (amor <i>and</i> dilectio) <i>are in Scripture used
indifferently of good and evil affection.</i></p>

<p>He who resolves to love God, and to love his neighbour as
himself, not according to man but according to God, is on
account of this love said to be of a good will; and this is in
Scripture more commonly called charity, but it is also, even
in the same books, called love. For the apostle says that the
man to be elected as a ruler of the people must be a lover of
good.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And when the Lord Himself had asked Peter, "Hast
thou a regard for me (<i>diligis</i>) more than these?" Peter replied,
"Lord, Thou knowest that I love (<i>amo</i>) Thee." And
again a second time the Lord asked not whether Peter loved
(<i>amaret</i>) Him, but whether he had a regard (<i>diligeret</i>) for Him,
and he again answered, "Lord, Thou knowest that I love (<i>amo</i>)
Thee." But on the third interrogation the Lord Himself no
longer says, "Hast thou a regard (<i>diligis</i>) for me," but "Lovest
thou (<i>amas</i>) me?" And then the evangelist adds, "Peter was
grieved because He said unto him the third time, Lovest thou
(<i>amas</i>) me?" though the Lord had not said three times but only
once, "Lovest thou (<i>amas</i>) me?" and twice "<i>Diligis me?</i>" from
which we gather that, even when the Lord said "<i>diligis</i>," He used
an equivalent for "<i>amas</i>." Peter, too, throughout used one word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for the one thing, and the third time also replied, "Lord, Thou
knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love (<i>amo</i>) Thee."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>I have judged it right to mention this, because some are
of opinion that charity or regard (<i>dilectio</i>) is one thing, love
(<i>amor</i>) another. They say that <i>dilectio</i> is used of a good affection,
<i>amor</i> of an evil love. But it is very certain that even
secular literature knows no such distinction. However, it is
for the philosophers to determine whether and how they differ,
though their own writings sufficiently testify that they make
great account of love (<i>amor</i>) placed on good objects, and even
on God Himself. But we wished to show that the Scriptures
of our religion, whose authority we prefer to all writings whatsoever,
make no distinction between <i>amor</i>, <i>dilectio</i>, and <i>caritas</i>;
and we have already shown that <i>amor</i> is used in a good connection.
And if any one fancy that <i>amor</i> is no doubt used
both of good and bad loves, but that <i>dilectio</i> is reserved for
the good only, let him remember what the psalm says, "He
that loveth (<i>diligit</i>) iniquity hateth his own soul;"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the
words of the Apostle John, "If any man love (<i>diligere</i>) the
world, the love (<i>dilectio</i>) of the Father is not in him."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here
you have in one passage <i>dilectio</i> used both in a good and a bad
sense. And if any one demands an instance of <i>amor</i> being
used in a bad sense (for we have already shown its use in a
good sense), let him read the words, "For men shall be lovers
(<i>amantes</i>) of their own selves, lovers (<i>amatores</i>) of money."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The right will is, therefore, well-directed love, and the
wrong will is ill-directed love. Love, then, yearning to have
what is loved, is desire; and having and enjoying it, is joy;
fleeing what is opposed to it, it is fear; and feeling what is
opposed to it, when it has befallen it, it is sadness. Now
these motions are evil if the love is evil; good if the love is
good. What we assert let us prove from Scripture. The
apostle "desires to depart, and to be with Christ."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And,
"My soul desired to long for Thy judgments;"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> or if it is
more appropriate to say, "My soul longed to desire Thy judgments."
And, "The desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Yet there has always obtained the usage of understanding desire
and concupiscence in a bad sense if the object be not defined.
But joy is used in a good sense: "Be glad in the Lord, and
rejoice, ye righteous."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And, "Thou hast put gladness in my
heart."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And, "Thou wilt fill me with joy with Thy countenance."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Fear is used in a good sense by the apostle when
he says, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
And, "Be not high-minded, but fear."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> And, "I fear, lest by
any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty,
so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
in Christ."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But with respect to sadness, which Cicero prefers
to call sickness (<i>ægritudo</i>), and Virgil pain (<i>dolor</i>) (as he
says, "<i>Dolent gaudentque</i>"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>), but which I prefer to call sorrow,
because sickness and pain are more commonly used to express
bodily suffering,&mdash;with respect to this emotion, I say, the question
whether it can be used in a good sense is more difficult.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>8. <i>Of the three perturbations, which the Stoics admitted in the soul of the wise
man to the exclusion of grief or sadness, which the manly mind ought not
to experience.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Those emotions which the Greeks call &#949;&#8016;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#953;, and
which Cicero calls <i>constantiæ</i>, the Stoics would restrict to
three; and, instead of three "perturbations" in the soul of
the wise man, they substituted severally, in place of desire,
will; in place of joy, contentment; and for fear, caution;
and as to sickness or pain, which we, to avoid ambiguity,
preferred to call sorrow, they denied that it could exist in the
mind of a wise man. Will, they say, seeks the good, for this
the wise man does. Contentment has its object in good that
is possessed, and this the wise man continually possesses.
Caution avoids evil, and this the wise man ought to avoid.
But sorrow arises from evil that has already happened; and
as they suppose that no evil can happen to the wise man,
there can be no representative of sorrow in his mind. According
to them, therefore, none but the wise man wills, is
contented, uses caution; and that the fool can do no more
than desire, rejoice, fear, be sad. The former three affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Cicero calls <i>constantiæ</i>, the last four <i>perturbationes</i>. Many,
however, call these last <i>passions</i>; and, as I have said, the
Greeks call the former &#949;&#8016;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#953;, and the latter &#960;&#8049;&#952;&#951;. And
when I made a careful examination of Scripture to find
whether this terminology was sanctioned by it, I came upon
this saying of the prophet: "There is no contentment to the
wicked, saith the Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> as if the wicked might more properly
rejoice than be contented regarding evils, for contentment
is the property of the good and godly. I found also
that verse in the Gospel: "Whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them;"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which seems
to imply that evil or shameful things may be the object of
desire, but not of will. Indeed, some interpreters have added
"good things" to make the expression more in conformity
with customary usage, and have given this meaning, "Whatsoever
good deeds that ye would that men should do unto
you." For they thought that this would prevent any one
from wishing other men to provide him with unseemly, not to
say shameful, gratifications,&mdash;luxurious banquets, for example,&mdash;on
the supposition that if he returned the like to them he
would be fulfilling this precept. In the Greek Gospel, however,
from which the Latin is translated, "good" does not
occur, but only, "All things whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them," and, as I
believe, because "good" is already included in the word
"would;" for He does not say "desire."</p>

<p>Yet though we may sometimes avail ourselves of these
precise proprieties of language, we are not to be always
bridled by them; and when we read those writers against
whose authority it is unlawful to reclaim, we must accept
the meanings above mentioned in passages where a right
sense can be educed by no other interpretation, as in those
instances we adduced partly from the prophet, partly from
the Gospel. For who does not know that the wicked exult
with joy? Yet "there is no <i>contentment</i> for the wicked,
saith the Lord." And how so, unless because contentment,
when the word is used in its proper and distinctive significance,
means something different from joy? In like manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
who would deny that it were wrong to enjoin upon men that
whatever they desire others to do to them they should themselves
do to others, lest they should mutually please one
another by shameful and illicit pleasure? And yet the precept,
"Whatsoever ye <i>would</i> that men should do unto you, do
ye even so to them," is very wholesome and just. And how is
this, unless because the will is in this place used strictly, and
signifies that will which cannot have evil for its object? But
ordinary phraseology would not have allowed the saying, "Be
unwilling to make any manner of lie,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> had there not been
also an evil will, whose wickedness separates it from that
which the angels celebrated, "Peace on earth, of good will to
men."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> For "good" is superfluous if there is no other
kind of will but good will. And why should the apostle have
mentioned it among the praises of charity as a great thing,
that "it rejoices not in iniquity," unless because wickedness
does so rejoice? For even with secular writers these words
are used indifferently. For Cicero, that most fertile of
orators, says, "I desire, conscript fathers, to be merciful."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
And who would be so pedantic as to say that he should have
said "I will" rather than "I desire," because the word is used
in a good connection? Again, in Terence, the profligate
youth, burning with wild lust, says, "I will nothing else than
Philumena."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> That this "will" was lust is sufficiently indicated
by the answer of his old servant which is there introduced:
"How much better were it to try and banish that love
from your heart, than to speak so as uselessly to inflame your
passion still more!" And that contentment was used by secular
writers in a bad sense, that verse of Virgil testifies, in which
he most succinctly comprehends these four perturbations,&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The same author had also used the expression, "the evil
contentments of the mind."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> So that good and bad men
alike will, are cautious, and contented; or, to say the same
thing in other words, good and bad men alike desire, fear,
rejoice, but the former in a good, the latter in a bad fashion,
according as the will is right or wrong. Sorrow itself, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which the Stoics would not allow to be represented in the
mind of the wise man, is used in a good sense, and especially
in our writings. For the apostle praises the Corinthians
because they had a godly sorrow. But possibly some one
may say that the apostle congratulated them because they
were penitently sorry, and that such sorrow can exist only in
those who have sinned. For these are his words: "For I
perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though
it were but for a season. Now I rejoice, not that ye were
made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were
made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive
damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance
to salvation not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the
world worketh death. For, behold, this selfsame thing that
ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in
you!"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Consequently the Stoics may defend themselves by
replying,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that sorrow is indeed useful for repentance of sin,
but that this can have no place in the mind of the wise man,
inasmuch as no sin attaches to him of which he could
sorrowfully repent, nor any other evil the endurance or experience
of which could make him sorrowful. For they say
that Alcibiades (if my memory does not deceive me), who
believed himself happy, shed tears when Socrates argued with
him, and demonstrated that he was miserable because he was
foolish. In his case, therefore, folly was the cause of this
useful and desirable sorrow, wherewith a man mourns that he
is what he ought not to be. But the Stoics maintain not
that the fool, but that the wise man, cannot be sorrowful.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of the perturbations of the soul which appear as right affections in the
life of the righteous.</i></p>

<p>But so far as regards this question of mental perturbations,
we have answered these philosophers in the ninth book<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
of this work, showing that it is rather a verbal than a real
dispute, and that they seek contention rather than truth.
Among ourselves, according to the sacred Scriptures and
sound doctrine, the citizens of the holy city of God, who live
according to God in the pilgrimage of this life, both fear and
desire, and grieve and rejoice. And because their love is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
rightly placed, all these affections of theirs are right. They
fear eternal punishment, they desire eternal life; they grieve
because they themselves groan within themselves, waiting for
the adoption, the redemption of their body;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> they rejoice in
hope, because there "shall be brought to pass the saying that
is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In like
manner they fear to sin, they desire to persevere; they grieve
in sin, they rejoice in good works. They fear to sin, because
they hear that "because iniquity shall abound, the love of
many shall wax cold."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> They desire to persevere, because
they hear that it is written, "He that endureth to the end
shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> They grieve for sin, hearing that "If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> They rejoice in good works, because they hear
that "the Lord loveth a cheerful giver."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In like manner,
according as they are strong or weak, they fear or desire to
be tempted, grieve or rejoice in temptation. They fear to be
tempted, because they hear the injunction, "If a man be overtaken
in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one
in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also
be tempted."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> They desire to be tempted, because they hear

O Lord, and tempt me: try my reins and my heart."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> They
grieve in temptations, because they see Peter weeping;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> they

brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>And not only on their own account do they experience
these emotions, but also on account of those whose deliverance
they desire and whose perdition they fear, and whose
loss or salvation affects them with grief or with joy. For
if we who have come into the Church from among the Gentiles
may suitably instance that noble and mighty hero who
glories in his infirmities, the teacher (<i>doctor</i>) of the nations
in faith and truth, who also laboured more than all his fellow-apostles,
and instructed the tribes of God's people by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
epistles, which edified not only those of his own time, but
all those who were to be gathered in,&mdash;that hero, I say, and
athlete of Christ, instructed by Him, anointed of His Spirit,
crucified with Him, glorious in Him, lawfully maintaining
a great conflict on the theatre of this world, and being
made a spectacle to angels and men,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and pressing onwards
for the prize of his high calling,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>&mdash;very joyfully do we with
the eyes of faith behold him rejoicing with them that rejoice,
and weeping with them that weep;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> though hampered
by fightings without and fears within;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> desiring to depart
and to be with Christ;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> longing to see the Romans, that he
might have some fruit among them as among other Gentiles;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
being jealous over the Corinthians, and fearing in that
jealousy lest their minds should be corrupted from the chastity
that is in Christ;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> having great heaviness and continual
sorrow of heart for the Israelites,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> because they, being ignorant
of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
righteousness of God;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and expressing not only his sorrow,
but bitter lamentation over some who had formally sinned
and had not repented of their uncleanness and fornications.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>If these emotions and affections, arising as they do from
the love of what is good and from a holy charity, are to
be called vices, then let us allow these emotions which are
truly vices to pass under the name of virtues. But since
these affections, when they are exercised in a becoming way,
follow the guidance of right reason, who will dare to say
that they are diseases or vicious passions? Wherefore even
the Lord Himself, when He condescended to lead a human
life in the form of a slave, had no sin whatever, and yet
exercised these emotions where He judged they should be
exercised. For as there was in Him a true human body and
a true human soul, so was there also a true human emotion.
When, therefore, we read in the Gospel that the hard-heartedness
of the Jews moved Him to sorrowful indignation,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
He said, "I am glad for your sakes, to the intent ye may
believe,"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> that when about to raise Lazarus He even shed
tears,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that He earnestly desired to eat the passover with
His disciples,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that as His passion drew near His soul was
sorrowful,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> these emotions are certainly not falsely ascribed
to Him. But as He became man when it pleased Him, so,
in the grace of His definite purpose, when it pleased Him He
experienced those emotions in His human soul.</p>

<p>But we must further make the admission, that even when
these affections are well regulated, and according to God's
will, they are peculiar to this life, not to that future life we
look for, and that often we yield to them against our will.
And thus sometimes we weep in spite of ourselves, being
carried beyond ourselves, not indeed by culpable desire, but
by praiseworthy charity. In us, therefore, these affections
arise from human infirmity; but it was not so with the Lord
Jesus, for even His infirmity was the consequence of His
power. But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we
are rather worse men than better if we have none of these
emotions at all. For the apostle vituperated and abominated
some who, as he said, were "without natural affection."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
The sacred Psalmist also found fault with those of whom he
said, "I looked for some to lament with me, and there was
none."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> For to be quite free from pain while we are in this
place of misery is only purchased, as one of this world's
literati perceived and remarked,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> at the price of blunted sensibilities
both of mind and body. And therefore that which
the Greeks call &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;, and what the Latins would call, if
their language would allow them, "impassibilitas," if it be
taken to mean an impassibility of spirit and not of body, or,
in other words, a freedom from those emotions which are contrary
to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a
good and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is
attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle are the
confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently
pious, just, and holy men: "If we say we have no sin, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> When there
shall be no sin in a man, then there shall be this &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;.
At present it is enough if we live without crime; and he
who thinks he lives without sin puts aside not sin, but
pardon. And if that is to be called apathy, where the mind
is the subject of no emotion, then who would not consider
this insensibility to be worse than all vices? It may, indeed,
reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness we
hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or sadness; but
who that is not quite lost to truth would say that neither
love nor joy shall be experienced there? But if by apathy a
condition be meant in which no fear terrifies nor any pain
annoys, we must in this life renounce such a state if we
would live according to God's will, but may hope to enjoy
it in that blessedness which is promised as our eternal condition.</p>

<p>For that fear of which the Apostle John says, "There is
no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear, because
fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in
love,"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>&mdash;that fear is not of the same kind as the Apostle
Paul felt lest the Corinthians should be seduced by the
subtlety of the serpent; for love is susceptible of this fear,
yea, love alone is capable of it. But the fear which is not in
love is of that kind of which Paul himself says, "For ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> But
as for that "clean fear which endureth for ever,"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> if it is to
exist in the world to come (and how else can it be said to
endure for ever?), it is not a fear deterring us from evil
which may happen, but preserving us in the good which
cannot be lost. For where the love of acquired good is
unchangeable, there certainly the fear that avoids evil is, if
I may say so, free from anxiety. For under the name of
"clean fear" David signifies that will by which we shall
necessarily shrink from sin, and guard against it, not with the
anxiety of weakness, which fears that we may strongly sin,
but with the tranquillity of perfect love. Or if no kind of
fear at all shall exist in that most imperturbable security of
perpetual and blissful delights, then the expression, "The fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever," must be taken in the
same sense as that other, "The patience of the poor shall not
perish for ever."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> For patience, which is necessary only
where ills are to be borne, shall not be eternal, but that which
patience leads us to will be eternal. So perhaps this "clean
fear" is said to endure for ever, because that to which fear
leads shall endure.</p>

<p>And since this is so,&mdash;since we must live a good life in
order to attain to a blessed life,&mdash;a good life has all these
affections right, a bad life has them wrong. But in the
blessed life eternal there will be love and joy, not only right,
but also assured; but fear and grief there will be none.
Whence it already appears in some sort what manner of persons
the citizens of the city of God must be in this their
pilgrimage, who live after the spirit, not after the flesh,&mdash;that
is to say, according to God, not according to man,&mdash;and what
manner of persons they shall be also in that immortality
whither they are journeying. And the city or society of the
wicked, who live not according to God, but according to man,
and who accept the doctrines of men or devils in the worship
of a false and contempt of the true divinity, is shaken with
those wicked emotions as by diseases and disturbances. And
if there be some of its citizens who seem to restrain and, as
it were, temper those passions, they are so elated with ungodly
pride, that their disease is as much greater as their
pain is less. And if some, with a vanity monstrous in proportion
to its rarity, have become enamoured of themselves
because they can be stimulated and excited by no emotion,
moved or bent by no affection, such persons rather lose all
humanity than obtain true tranquillity. For a thing is not
necessarily right because it is inflexible, nor healthy because
it is insensible.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Whether it is to be believed that our first parents in Paradise, before they
sinned, were free from all perturbation.</i></p>

<p>But it is a fair question, whether our first parent or first
parents (for there was a marriage of two), before they sinned,
experienced in their animal body such emotions as we shall
not experience in the spiritual body when sin has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
purged and finally abolished. For if they did, then how
were they blessed in that boasted place of bliss, Paradise?
For who that is affected by fear or grief can be called absolutely
blessed? And what could those persons fear or suffer
in such affluence of blessings, where neither death nor ill-health
was feared, and where nothing was wanting which a
good will could desire, and nothing present which could
interrupt man's mental or bodily enjoyment? Their love to
God was unclouded, and their mutual affection was that of
faithful and sincere marriage; and from this love flowed a
wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was
loved. Their avoidance of sin was tranquil; and, so long as
it was maintained, no other ill at all could invade them and
bring sorrow. Or did they perhaps desire to touch and eat
the forbidden fruit, yet feared to die; and thus both fear and
desire already, even in that blissful place, preyed upon those
first of mankind? Away with the thought that such could
be the case where there was no sin! And, indeed, this is
already sin, to desire those things which the law of God
forbids, and to abstain from them through fear of punishment,
not through love of righteousness. Away, I say, with
the thought, that before there was any sin, there should
already have been committed regarding that fruit the very
sin which our Lord warns us against regarding a woman:
"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> As happy,
then, as were these our first parents, who were agitated by no
mental perturbations, and annoyed by no bodily discomforts,
so happy should the whole human race have been, had they
not introduced that evil which they have transmitted to their
posterity, and had none of their descendants committed
iniquity worthy of damnation; but this original blessedness
continuing until, in virtue of that benediction which said,
"Increase and multiply,"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the number of the predestined
saints should have been completed, there would then have
been bestowed that higher felicity which is enjoyed by the
most blessed angels,&mdash;a blessedness in which there should
have been a secure assurance that no one would sin, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
one die; and so should the saints have lived, after no taste of
labour, pain, or death, as now they shall live in the resurrection,
after they have endured all these things.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the fall of the first man, in whom nature was created good, and can be
restored only by its Author.</i></p>

<p>But because God foresaw all things, and was therefore not
ignorant that man also would fall, we ought to consider this
holy city in connection with what God foresaw and ordained,
and not according to our own ideas, which do not embrace
God's ordination. For man, by his sin, could not disturb the
divine counsel, nor compel God to change what He had
decreed; for God's foreknowledge had anticipated both,&mdash;that
is to say, both how evil the man whom He had created good
should become, and what good He Himself should even thus
derive from him. For though God is said to change His
determinations (so that in a tropical sense the Holy Scripture
says even that God repented<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>), this is said with reference to
man's expectation, or the order of natural causes, and not
with reference to that which the Almighty had foreknown
that He would do. Accordingly God, as it is written, made
man upright,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and consequently with a good will. For if
he had not had a good will, he could not have been upright.
The good will, then, is the work of God; for God created
him with it. But the first evil will, which preceded all man's
evil acts, was rather a kind of falling away from the work of
God to its own works than any positive work. And therefore
the acts resulting were evil, not having God, but the will
itself for their end; so that the will or the man himself, so
far as his will is bad, was as it were the evil tree bringing
forth evil fruit. Moreover, the bad will, though it be not in
harmony with, but opposed to nature, inasmuch as it is a vice
or blemish, yet it is true of it as of all vice, that it cannot
exist except in a nature, and only in a nature created out of
nothing, and not in that which the Creator has begotten of
Himself, as He begot the Word, by whom all things were
made. For though God formed man of the dust of the earth,
yet the earth itself, and every earthly material, is absolutely
created out of nothing; and man's soul, too, God created out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of nothing, and joined to the body, when He made man. But
evils are so thoroughly overcome by good, that though they
are permitted to exist, for the sake of demonstrating how the
most righteous foresight of God can make a good use even of
them, yet good can exist without evil, as in the true and
supreme God Himself, and as in every invisible and visible
celestial creature that exists above this murky atmosphere;
but evil cannot exist without good, because the natures in
which evil exists, in so far as they are natures, are good.
And evil is removed, not by removing any nature, or part of
a nature, which had been introduced by the evil, but by
healing and correcting that which had been vitiated and
depraved. The will, therefore, is then truly free, when it is
not the slave of vices and sins. Such was it given us by
God; and this being lost by its own fault, can only be restored
by Him who was able at first to give it. And therefore the
truth says, "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed;"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which is equivalent to saying, If the Son shall save
you, ye shall be saved indeed. For He is our Liberator,
inasmuch as He is our Saviour.</p>

<p>Man then lived with God for his rule in a paradise at once
physical and spiritual. For neither was it a paradise only
physical for the advantage of the body, and not also spiritual
for the advantage of the mind; nor was it only spiritual to
afford enjoyment to man by his internal sensations, and not
also physical to afford him enjoyment through his external
senses. But obviously it was both for both ends. But after
that proud and therefore envious angel (of whose fall I have
said as much as I was able in the eleventh and twelfth books
of this work, as well as that of his fellows, who, from being
God's angels, became his angels), preferring to rule with a
kind of pomp of empire rather than to be another's subject,
fell from the spiritual Paradise, and essaying to insinuate his
persuasive guile into the mind of man, whose unfallen condition
provoked him to envy now that himself was fallen, he
chose the serpent as his mouthpiece in that bodily Paradise
in which it and all the other earthly animals were living with
those two human beings, the man and his wife, subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
them, and harmless; and he chose the serpent because, being
slippery, and moving in tortuous windings, it was suitable for
his purpose. And this animal being subdued to his wicked
ends by the presence and superior force of his angelic nature,
he abused as his instrument, and first tried his deceit upon
the woman, making his assault upon the weaker part of that
human alliance, that he might gradually gain the whole, and
not supposing that the man would readily give ear to him, or
be deceived, but that he might yield to the error of the woman.
For as Aaron was not induced to agree with the people when
they blindly wished him to make an idol, and yet yielded to
constraint; and as it is not credible that Solomon was so blind
as to suppose that idols should be worshipped, but was drawn
over to such sacrilege by the blandishments of women; so we
cannot believe that Adam was deceived, and supposed the
devil's word to be truth, and therefore transgressed God's law,
but that he by the drawings of kindred yielded to the woman,
the husband to the wife, the one human being to the only
other human being. For not without significance did the
apostle say, "And Adam was not deceived, but the woman
being deceived was in the transgression;"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> but he speaks
thus, because the woman accepted as true what the serpent
told her, but the man could not bear to be severed from his
only companion, even though this involved a partnership in
sin. He was not on this account less culpable, but sinned
with his eyes open. And so the apostle does not say, "He did
not sin," but "He was not deceived." For he shows that he
sinned when he says, "By one man sin entered into the
world,"<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and immediately after more distinctly, "In the likeness
of Adam's transgression." But he meant that those are
deceived who do not judge that which they do to be sin; but
he knew. Otherwise how were it true "Adam was not deceived?"
But having as yet no experience of the divine
severity, he was possibly deceived in so far as he thought his
sin venial. And consequently he was not deceived as the
woman was deceived, but he was deceived as to the judgment
which would be passed on his apology: "The woman
whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me, and I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
eat."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> What need of saying more? Although they were
not both deceived by credulity, yet both were entangled in
the snares of the devil, and taken by sin.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the nature of man's first sin.</i></p>

<p>If any one finds a difficulty in understanding why other
sins do not alter human nature as it was altered by the transgression
of those first human beings, so that on account of it
this nature is subject to the great corruption we feel and see,
and to death, and is distracted and tossed with so many furious
and contending emotions, and is certainly far different from
what it was before sin, even though it were then lodged in an
animal body,&mdash;if, I say, any one is moved by this, he ought
not to think that that sin was a small and light one because
it was committed about food, and that not bad nor noxious,
except because it was forbidden; for in that spot of singular
felicity God could not have created and planted any evil thing.
But by the precept He gave, God commended obedience, which
is, in a sort, the mother and guardian of all the virtues in the
reasonable creature, which was so created that submission is
advantageous to it, while the fulfilment of its own will in
preference to the Creator's is destruction. And as this commandment
enjoining abstinence from one kind of food in the
midst of great abundance of other kinds was so easy to keep,&mdash;so
light a burden to the memory,&mdash;and, above all, found no resistance
to its observance in lust, which only afterwards sprung
up as the penal consequence of sin, the iniquity of violating
it was all the greater in proportion to the ease with which it
might have been kept.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>That in Adam's sin an evil will preceded the evil act.</i></p>

<p>Our first parents fell into open disobedience because already
they were secretly corrupted; for the evil act had never
been done had not an evil will preceded it. And what is the
origin of our evil will but pride? For "pride is the beginning
of sin."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And what is pride but the craving for undue
exaltation? And this is undue exaltation, when the soul
abandons Him to whom it ought to cleave as its end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
becomes a kind of end to itself. This happens when it becomes
its own satisfaction. And it does so when it falls
away from that unchangeable good which ought to satisfy it
more than itself. This falling away is spontaneous; for if
the will had remained stedfast in the love of that higher and
changeless good by which it was illumined to intelligence
and kindled into love, it would not have turned away to find
satisfaction in itself, and so become frigid and benighted;
the woman would not have believed the serpent spoke the
truth, nor would the man have preferred the request of his
wife to the command of God, nor have supposed that it was
a venial transgression to cleave to the partner of his life even
in a partnership of sin. The wicked deed, then,&mdash;that is to
say, the transgression of eating the forbidden fruit,&mdash;was committed
by persons who were already wicked. That "evil
fruit"<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> could be brought forth only by "a corrupt tree." But
that the tree was evil was not the result of nature; for certainly
it could become so only by the vice of the will, and
vice is contrary to nature. Now, nature could not have been
depraved by vice had it not been made out of nothing. Consequently,
that it is a nature, this is because it is made by
God; but that it falls away from Him, this is because it is
made out of nothing. But man did not so fall away<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> as to
become absolutely nothing; but being turned towards himself,
his being became more contracted than it was when he clave
to Him who supremely is. Accordingly, to exist in himself,
that is, to be his own satisfaction after abandoning God, is
not quite to become a nonentity, but to approximate to that.
And therefore the holy Scriptures designate the proud by another
name, "self-pleasers." For it is good to have the heart
lifted up, yet not to one's self, for this is proud, but to the
Lord, for this is obedient, and can be the act only of the
humble. There is, therefore, something in humility which,
strangely enough, exalts the heart, and something in pride
which debases it. This seems, indeed, to be contradictory,
that loftiness should debase and lowliness exalt. But pious
humility enables us to submit to what is above us; and
nothing is more exalted above us than God; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
humility, by making us subject to God, exalts us. But pride,
being a defect of nature, by the very act of refusing subjection
and revolting from Him who is supreme, falls to a low condition;
and then comes to pass what is written: "Thou castedst
them down when they lifted up themselves."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> For he does
not say, "when they had been lifted up," as if first they were
exalted, and then afterwards cast down; but "when they lifted
up themselves" even then they were cast down,&mdash;that is to say,
the very lifting up was already a fall. And therefore it is
that humility is specially recommended to the city of God as
it sojourns in this world, and is specially exhibited in the city
of God, and in the person of Christ its King; while the contrary
vice of pride, according to the testimony of the sacred
writings, specially rules his adversary the devil. And certainly
this is the great difference which distinguishes the two cities
of which we speak, the one being the society of the godly
men, the other of the ungodly, each associated with the angels
that adhere to their party, and the one guided and fashioned
by love of self, the other by love of God.</p>

<p>The devil, then, would not have ensnared man in the open
and manifest sin of doing what God had forbidden, had man
not already begun to live for himself. It was this that made
him listen with pleasure to the words, "Ye shall be as gods,"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
which they would much more readily have accomplished by
obediently adhering to their supreme and true end than by
proudly living to themselves. For created gods are gods not
by virtue of what is in themselves, but by a participation of
the true God. By craving to be more, man becomes less; and
by aspiring to be self-sufficing, he fell away from Him who
truly suffices him. Accordingly, this wicked desire which
prompts man to please himself as if he were himself light, and
which thus turns him away from that light by which, had he
followed it, he would himself have become light,&mdash;this wicked
desire, I say, already secretly existed in him, and the open
sin was but its consequence. For that is true which is
written, "Pride goeth before destruction, and before honour
is humility;"<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that is to say, secret ruin precedes open ruin,
while the former is not counted ruin. For who counts exaltation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ruin, though no sooner is the Highest forsaken than a
fall is begun? But who does not recognise it as ruin, when
there occurs an evident and indubitable transgression of the
commandment? And consequently, God's prohibition had
reference to such an act as, when committed, could not be
defended on any pretence of doing what was righteous.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> And
I make bold to say that it is useful for the proud to fall into
an open and indisputable transgression, and so displease themselves,
as already, by pleasing themselves, they had fallen.
For Peter was in a healthier condition when he wept and was
dissatisfied with himself, than when he boldly presumed and
satisfied himself. And this is averred by the sacred Psalmist
when he says, "Fill their faces with shame, that they may
seek Thy name, O Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that is, that they who have pleased
themselves in seeking their own glory may be pleased and
satisfied with Thee in seeking Thy glory.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the pride in the sin, which was worse than the sin itself.</i></p>

<p>But it is a worse and more damnable pride which casts
about for the shelter of an excuse even in manifest sins, as
these our first parents did, of whom the woman said, "The
serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;" and the man said, "The
woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the
tree, and I did eat."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Here there is no word of begging
pardon, no word of entreaty for healing. For though they
do not, like Cain, deny that they have perpetrated the deed,
yet their pride seeks to refer its wickedness to another,&mdash;the
woman's pride to the serpent, the man's to the woman. But
where there is a plain transgression of a divine commandment,
this is rather to accuse than to excuse oneself. For
the fact that the woman sinned on the serpent's persuasion,
and the man at the woman's offer, did not make the transgression
less, as if there were any one whom we ought rather
to believe or yield to than God.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the justice of the punishment with which our first parents were visited for
their disobedience.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, because the sin was a despising of the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of God,&mdash;who had created man; who had made him in His own
image; who had set him above the other animals; who had
placed him in Paradise; who had enriched him with abundance
of every kind and of safety; who had laid upon him neither
many, nor great, nor difficult commandments, but, in order to
make a wholesome obedience easy to him, had given him a
single very brief and very light precept by which He reminded
that creature whose service was to be free that He was Lord,&mdash;it
was just that condemnation followed, and condemnation
such that man, who by keeping the commandments should
have been spiritual even in his flesh, became fleshly even in
his spirit; and as in his pride he had sought to be his own
satisfaction, God in His justice abandoned him to himself,
not to live in the absolute independence he affected, but
instead of the liberty he desired, to live dissatisfied with himself
in a hard and miserable bondage to him to whom by
sinning he had yielded himself, doomed in spite of himself
to die in body as he had willingly become dead in spirit,
condemned even to eternal death (had not the grace of God
delivered him) because he had forsaken eternal life. Whoever
thinks such punishment either excessive or unjust shows
his inability to measure the great iniquity of sinning where
sin might so easily have been avoided. For as Abraham's
obedience is with justice pronounced to be great, because the
thing commanded, to kill his son, was very difficult, so in
Paradise the disobedience was the greater, because the difficulty
of that which was commanded was imperceptible.
And as the obedience of the second Man was the more
laudable because He became obedient even "unto death,"<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> so
the disobedience of the first man was the more detestable
because he became disobedient even unto death. For where
the penalty annexed to disobedience is great, and the thing
commanded by the Creator is easy, who can sufficiently estimate
how great a wickedness it is, in a matter so easy, not to
obey the authority of so great a power, even when that power
deters with so terrible a penalty?</p>

<p>In short, to say all in a word, what but disobedience was
the punishment of disobedience in that sin? For what else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
is man's misery but his own disobedience to himself, so that
in consequence of his not being willing to do what he could
do, he now wills to do what he cannot? For though he
could not do all things in Paradise before he sinned, yet he
wished to do only what he could do, and therefore he could
do all things he wished. But now, as we recognise in his
offspring, and as divine Scripture testifies, "Man is like to
vanity."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> For who can count how many things he wishes
which he cannot do, so long as he is disobedient to himself,
that is, so long as his mind and his flesh do not obey his
will? For in spite of himself his mind is both frequently
disturbed, and his flesh suffers, and grows old, and dies; and
in spite of ourselves we suffer whatever else we suffer, and
which we would not suffer if our nature absolutely and in all
its parts obeyed our will. But is it not the infirmities of the
flesh which hamper it in its service? Yet what does it
matter <i>how</i> its service is hampered, so long as the fact remains,
that by the just retribution of the sovereign God whom we
refused to be subject to and serve, our flesh, which was subjected
to us, now torments us by insubordination, although
our disobedience brought trouble on ourselves, not upon God?
For He is not in need of our service as we of our body's;
and therefore what we did was no punishment to Him, but
what we receive is so to us. And the pains which are called
bodily are pains of the soul in and from the body. For what
pain or desire can the flesh feel by itself and without the
soul? But when the flesh is said to desire or to suffer, it is
meant, as we have explained, that the man does so, or some
part of the soul which is affected by the sensation of the
flesh, whether a harsh sensation causing pain, or gentle, causing
pleasure. But pain in the flesh is only a discomfort of the
soul arising from the flesh, and a kind of shrinking from its
suffering, as the pain of the soul which is called sadness is a
shrinking from those things which have happened to us in
spite of ourselves. But sadness is frequently preceded by
fear, which is itself in the soul, not in the flesh; while bodily
pain is not preceded by any kind of fear of the flesh, which
can be felt in the flesh before the pain. But pleasure is preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
by a certain appetite which is felt in the flesh like a
craving, as hunger and thirst and that generative appetite
which is most commonly identified with the name "lust,"
though this is the generic word for all desires. For anger
itself was defined by the ancients as nothing else than the
lust of revenge;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> although sometimes a man is angry even at
inanimate objects which cannot feel his vengeance, as when
one breaks a pen, or crushes a quill that writes badly. Yet
even this, though less reasonable, is in its way a lust of
revenge, and is, so to speak, a mysterious kind of shadow of
[the great law of] retribution, that they who do evil should
suffer evil. There is therefore a lust for revenge, which is
called anger; there is a lust of money, which goes by the
name of avarice; there is a lust of conquering, no matter by
what means, which is called opinionativeness; there is a lust
of applause, which is named boasting. There are many and
various lusts, of which some have names of their own, while
others have not. For who could readily give a name to the
lust of ruling, which yet has a powerful influence in the
soul of tyrants, as civil wars bear witness?</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the evil of lust,&mdash;a word which, though applicable to many vices, is
specially appropriated to sexual uncleanness.</i></p>

<p>Although, therefore, lust may have many objects, yet when
no object is specified, the word lust usually suggests to the
mind the lustful excitement of the organs of generation.
And this lust not only takes possession of the whole body
and outward members, but also makes itself felt within, and
moves the whole man with a passion in which mental emotion
is mingled with bodily appetite, so that the pleasure which
results is the greatest of all bodily pleasures. So possessing
indeed is this pleasure, that at the moment of time in which
it is consummated, all mental activity is suspended. What
friend of wisdom and holy joys, who, being married, but
knowing, as the apostle says, "how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour, not in the disease of desire, as the
Gentiles who know not God,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> would not prefer, if this were
possible, to beget children without this lust, so that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
function of begetting offspring the members created for this
purpose should not be stimulated by the heat of lust, but
should be actuated by his volition, in the same way as his
other members serve him for their respective ends? But
even those who delight in this pleasure are not moved to it
at their own will, whether they confine themselves to lawful
or transgress to unlawful pleasures; but sometimes this lust
importunes them in spite of themselves, and sometimes fails
them when they desire to feel it, so that though lust rages in
the mind, it stirs not in the body. Thus, strangely enough,
this emotion not only fails to obey the legitimate desire to
beget offspring, but also refuses to serve lascivious lust; and
though it often opposes its whole combined energy to the
soul that resists it, sometimes also it is divided against itself,
and while it moves the soul, leaves the body unmoved.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the nakedness of our first parents, which they saw after their base and
shameful sin.</i></p>

<p>Justly is shame very specially connected with this lust;
justly, too, these members themselves, being moved and
restrained not at our will, but by a certain independent
autocracy, so to speak, are called "shameful." Their condition
was different before sin. For as it is written, "They
were naked and were not ashamed,"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>&mdash;not that their nakedness
was unknown to them, but because nakedness was not
yet shameful, because not yet did lust move those members
without the will's consent; not yet did the flesh by its disobedience
testify against the disobedience of man. For they
were not created blind, as the unenlightened vulgar fancy;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
for Adam saw the animals to whom he gave names, and of Eve
we read, "The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was pleasant to the eyes."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Their eyes, therefore, were
open, but were not open to this, that is to say, were not
observant so as to recognise what was conferred upon them
by the garment of grace, for they had no consciousness of
their members warring against their will. But when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were stripped of this grace,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> that their disobedience might be
punished by fit retribution, there began in the movement of
their bodily members a shameless novelty which made nakedness
indecent: it at once made them observant and made
them ashamed. And therefore, after they violated God's
command by open transgression, it is written: "And the eyes
of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> "The eyes of them both were opened," not
to see, for already they saw, but to discern between the good
they had lost and the evil into which they had fallen. And
therefore also the tree itself which they were forbidden to
touch was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
from this circumstance, that if they ate of it it would impart
to them this knowledge. For the discomfort of sickness
reveals the pleasure of health. "They knew," therefore,
"that they were naked,"&mdash;naked of that grace which prevented
them from being ashamed of bodily nakedness while
the law of sin offered no resistance to their mind. And thus
they obtained a knowledge which they would have lived in
blissful ignorance of, had they, in trustful obedience to God,
declined to commit that offence which involved them in the
experience of the hurtful effects of unfaithfulness and disobedience.
And therefore, being ashamed of the disobedience
of their own flesh, which witnessed to their disobedience
while it punished it, "they sewed fig leaves together, and
made themselves aprons," that is, cinctures for their privy
parts; for some interpreters have rendered the word by
<i>succinctoria</i>. <i>Campestria</i> is, indeed, a Latin word, but it
is used of the drawers or aprons used for a similar purpose
by the young men who stripped for exercise in the <i>campus</i>;
hence those who were so girt were commonly called <i>campestrati</i>.
Shame modestly covered that which lust disobediently
moved in opposition to the will which was thus punished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for its own disobedience. Consequently all nations, being
propagated from that one stock, have so strong an instinct to
cover the shameful parts, that some barbarians do not uncover
them even in the bath, but wash with their drawers
on. In the dark solitudes of India also, though some philosophers
go naked, and are therefore called gymnosophists,
yet they make an exception in the case of these members,
and cover them.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the shame which attends all sexual intercourse.</i></p>

<p>Lust requires for its consummation darkness and secrecy;
and this not only when unlawful intercourse is desired, but
even such fornication as the earthly city has legalized.
Where there is no fear of punishment, these permitted
pleasures still shrink from the public eye. Even where provision
is made for this lust, secrecy also is provided; and while
lust found it easy to remove the prohibitions of law, shamelessness
found it impossible to lay aside the veil of retirement. For
even shameless men call this shameful; and though they love
the pleasure, dare not display it. What! does not even conjugal
intercourse, sanctioned as it is by law for the propagation
of children, legitimate and honourable though it be, does
it not seek retirement from every eye? Before the bridegroom
fondles his bride, does he not exclude the attendants, and even
the paranymphs, and such friends as the closest ties have
admitted to the bridal chamber? The greatest master of
Roman eloquence says, that all right actions wish to be set in
the light, <i>i.e.</i> desire to be known. This right action, however,
has such a desire to be known, that yet it blushes to be seen.
Who does not know what passes between husband and wife
that children may be born? Is it not for this purpose that
wives are married with such ceremony? And yet, when this
well-understood act is gone about for the procreation of children,
not even the children themselves, who may already have
been born to them, are suffered to be witnesses. This right
action seeks the light, in so far as it seeks to be known, but
yet dreads being seen. And why so, if not because that
which is by nature fitting and decent is so done as to be
accompanied with a shame-begetting penalty of sin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">19. <i>That it is now necessary, as it was not before man sinned, to bridle anger
and lust by the restraining influence of wisdom.</i></p>

<p>Hence it is that even the philosophers who have approximated
to the truth have avowed that anger and lust are vicious
mental emotions, because, even when exercised towards objects
which wisdom does not prohibit, they are moved in an ungoverned
and inordinate manner, and consequently need the
regulation of mind and reason. And they assert that this third
part of the mind is posted as it were in a kind of citadel, to give
rule to these other parts, so that, while it rules and they serve,
man's righteousness is preserved without a breach.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> These
parts, then, which they acknowledge to be vicious even in a
wise and temperate man, so that the mind, by its composing
and restraining influence, must bridle and recall them from
those objects towards which they are unlawfully moved, and
give them access to those which the law of wisdom sanctions,&mdash;that
anger, <i>e.g.</i>, may be allowed for the enforcement of a just
authority, and lust for the duty of propagating offspring,&mdash;these
parts, I say, were not vicious in Paradise before sin,
for they were never moved in opposition to a holy will towards
any object from which it was necessary that they should be
withheld by the restraining bridle of reason. For though
now they are moved in this way, and are regulated by a
bridling and restraining power, which those who live temperately,
justly, and godly exercise, sometimes with ease, and
sometimes with greater difficulty, this is not the sound health
of nature, but the weakness which results from sin. And how
is it that shame does not hide the acts and words dictated by
anger or other emotions, as it covers the motions of lust,
unless because the members of the body which we employ for
accomplishing them are moved, not by the emotions themselves,
but by the authority of the consenting will? For he
who in his anger rails at or even strikes some one, could not
do so were not his tongue and hand moved by the authority
of the will, as also they are moved when there is no anger.
But the organs of generation are so subjected to the rule of
lust, that they have no motion but what it communicates.
It is this we are ashamed of; it is this which blushingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
hides from the eyes of onlookers. And rather will a man
endure a crowd of witnesses when he is unjustly venting his
anger on some one, than the eye of one man when he innocently
copulates with his wife.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the foolish beastliness of the Cynics.</i></p>

<p>It is this which those canine or cynic<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> philosophers have
overlooked, when they have, in violation of the modest instincts
of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless
opinion, worthy indeed of dogs, viz., that as the matrimonial
act is legitimate, no one should be ashamed to perform it
openly, in the street or in any public place. Instinctive
shame has overborne this wild fancy. For though it is related<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
that Diogenes once dared to put his opinion in practice, under
the impression that his sect would be all the more famous if
his egregious shamelessness were deeply graven in the memory
of mankind, yet this example was not afterwards followed.
Shame had more influence with them, to make them blush
before men, than error to make them affect a resemblance to
dogs. And possibly, even in the case of Diogenes, and those
who did imitate him, there was but an appearance and pretence
of copulation, and not the reality. Even at this day
there are still Cynic philosophers to be seen; for these are
Cynics who are not content with being clad in the <i>pallium</i>,
but also carry a club; yet no one of them dares to do this
that we speak of. If they did, they would be spat upon, not
to say stoned, by the mob. Human nature, then, is without
doubt ashamed of this lust; and justly so, for the insubordination
of these members, and their defiance of the will, are the
clear testimony of the punishment of man's first sin. And it
was fitting that this should appear specially in those parts
by which is generated that nature which has been altered for
the worse by that first and great sin,&mdash;that sin from whose evil
connection no one can escape, unless God's grace expiate in
him individually that which was perpetrated to the destruction
of all in common, when all were in one man, and which
was avenged by God's justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">21. <i>That man's transgression did not annul the blessing of fecundity pronounced
upon man before he sinned, but infected it with the disease of lust.</i></p>

<p>Far be it, then, from us to suppose that our first parents in
Paradise felt that lust which caused them afterwards to blush
and hide their nakedness, or that by its means they should
have fulfilled the benediction of God, "Increase and multiply
and replenish the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> for it was after sin that lust
began. It was after sin that our nature, having lost the power
it had over the whole body, but not having lost all shame,
perceived, noticed, blushed at, and covered it. But that
blessing upon marriage, which encouraged them to increase
and multiply and replenish the earth, though, it continued
even after they had sinned, was yet given before they sinned,
in order that the procreation of children might be recognised
as part of the glory of marriage, and not of the punishment of
sin. But now, men being ignorant of the blessedness of Paradise,
suppose that children could not have been begotten there
in any other way than they know them to be begotten now,
<i>i.e.</i> by lust, at which even honourable marriage blushes; some
not simply rejecting, but sceptically deriding the divine Scriptures,
in which we read that our first parents, after they sinned,
were ashamed of their nakedness, and covered it; while others,
though they accept and honour Scripture, yet conceive that
this expression, "Increase and multiply," refers not to carnal
fecundity, because a similar expression is used of the soul in
the words, "Thou wilt multiply me with strength in my
soul;"<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and so, too, in the words which follow in Genesis,
"And replenish the earth, and subdue it," they understand by
the earth the body which the soul fills with its presence, and
which it rules over when it is multiplied in strength. And
they hold that children could no more then than now be
begotten without lust, which, after sin, was kindled, observed,
blushed for, and covered; and even that children would not
have been born in Paradise, but only outside of it, as in fact
it turned out. For it was after they were expelled from it
that they came together to beget children, and begot them.</p>

<p class="center">22. <i>Of the conjugal union as it was originally instituted and blessed by God.</i></p>

<p>But we, for our part, have no manner of doubt that to increase
and multiply and replenish the earth in virtue of the
blessing of God, is a gift of marriage as God instituted it
from the beginning before man sinned, when He created them
male and female,&mdash;in other words, two sexes manifestly distinct.
And it was this work of God on which His blessing
was pronounced. For no sooner had Scripture said, "Male
and female created He them,"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> than it immediately continues,
"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Increase,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it," etc.
And though all these things may not unsuitably be interpreted
in a spiritual sense, yet "male and female" cannot be
understood of two things in one man, as if there were in him
one thing which rules, another which is ruled; but it is quite
clear that they were created male and female, with bodies of
different sexes, for the very purpose of begetting offspring, and
so increasing, multiplying, and replenishing the earth; and it
is great folly to oppose so plain a fact. It was not of the
spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the
rational soul which rules and the irrational desire which is
ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme and
the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the
mind and the sense of the body, but plainly of the matrimonial
union by which the sexes are mutually bound together,
that our Lord, when asked whether it were lawful for any
cause to put away one's wife (for on account of the hardness
of the hearts of the Israelites Moses permitted a bill of
divorcement to be given), answered and said, "Have ye not
read that He which made them at the beginning made them
male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they
twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain,
but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let
not man put asunder."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It is certain, then, that from the
first men were created, as we see and know them to be now,
of two sexes, male and female, and that they are called one,
either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the origin of the woman, who was created from the side of the
man. And it is by this original example, which God Himself
instituted, that the apostle admonishes all husbands to love
their own wives in particular.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Whether generation should have taken place even in Paradise had man not
sinned, or whether there should have been any contention there between
chastity and lust.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But he who says that there should have been neither copulation
nor generation but for sin, virtually says that man's
sin was necessary to complete the number of the saints. For
if these two by not sinning should have continued to live
alone, because, as is supposed, they could not have begotten
children had they not sinned, then certainly sin was necessary
in order that there might be not only two but many righteous
men. And if this cannot be maintained without absurdity,
we must rather believe that the number of the saints fit to
complete this most blessed city would have been as great
though no one had sinned, as it is now that the grace of God
gathers its citizens out of the multitude of sinners, so long as
the children of this world generate and are generated.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>And therefore that marriage, worthy of the happiness of
Paradise, should have had desirable fruit without the shame
of lust, had there been no sin. But how that could be, there
is now no example to teach us. Nevertheless, it ought not to
seem incredible that one member might serve the will without
lust then, since so many serve it now. Do we now move our
feet and hands when we will to do the things we would by
means of these members? do we meet with no resistance in
them, but perceive that they are ready servants of the will,
both in our own case and in that of others, and especially of
artisans employed in mechanical operations, by which the
weakness and clumsiness of nature become, through industrious
exercise, wonderfully dexterous? and shall we not believe
that, like as all those members obediently serve the will, so
also should the members have discharged the function of
generation, though lust, the award of disobedience, had been
awanting? Did not Cicero, in discussing the difference of
governments in his <i>De Republica</i>, adopt a simile from human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nature, and say that we command our bodily members as
children, they are so obedient; but that the vicious parts of
the soul must be treated as slaves, and be coerced with a more
stringent authority? And no doubt, in the order of nature,
the soul is more excellent than the body; and yet the soul
commands the body more easily than itself. Nevertheless
this lust, of which we at present speak, is the more shameful
on this account, because the soul is therein neither master of
itself, so as not to lust at all, nor of the body, so as to keep
the members under the control of the will; for if they were
thus ruled, there should be no shame. But now the soul is
ashamed that the body, which by nature is inferior and subject
to it, should resist its authority. For in the resistance
experienced by the soul in the other emotions there is less
shame, because the resistance is from itself, and thus, when it
is conquered by itself, itself is the conqueror, although the
conquest is inordinate and vicious, because accomplished by
those parts of the soul which ought to be subject to reason,
yet, being accomplished by its own parts and energies, the
conquest is, as I say, its own. For when the soul conquers
itself to a due subordination, so that its unreasonable motions
are controlled by reason, while it again is subject to God, this
is a conquest virtuous and praiseworthy. Yet there is less
shame when the soul is resisted by its own vicious parts than
when its will and order are resisted by the body, which is
distinct from and inferior to it, and dependent on it for life
itself.</p>

<p>But so long as the will retains under its authority the other
members, without which the members excited by lust to resist
the will cannot accomplish what they seek, chastity is preserved,
and the delight of sin foregone. And certainly, had
not culpable disobedience been visited with penal disobedience,
the marriage of Paradise should have been ignorant of this
struggle and rebellion, this quarrel between will and lust, that
the will may be satisfied and lust restrained, but those members,
like all the rest, should have obeyed the will. The field
of generation<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> should have been sown by the organ created
for this purpose, as the earth is sown by the hand. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
whereas now, as we essay to investigate this subject more
exactly, modesty hinders us, and compels us to ask pardon of
chaste ears, there would have been no cause to do so, but we
could have discoursed freely, and without fear of seeming
obscene, upon all those points which occur to one who meditates
on the subject. There would not have been even words
which could be called obscene, but all that might be said of
these members would have been as pure as what is said of
the other parts of the body. Whoever, then, comes to the
perusal of these pages with unchaste mind, let him blame his
disposition, not his nature; let him brand the actings of his
own impurity, not the words which necessity forces us to use,
and for which every pure and pious reader or hearer will very
readily pardon me, while I expose the folly of that scepticism
which argues solely on the ground of its own experience, and
has no faith in anything beyond. He who is not scandalized
at the apostle's censure of the horrible wickedness of the women
who "changed the natural use into that which is against
nature,"<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> will read all this without being shocked, especially
as we are not, like Paul, citing and censuring a damnable uncleanness,
but are explaining, so far as we can, human generation,
while with Paul we avoid all obscenity of language.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>24. <i>That if men had remained innocent and obedient in Paradise, the generative
organs should have been in subjection to the will as the other members are.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The man, then, would have sown the seed, and the woman
received it, as need required, the generative organs being
moved by the will, not excited by lust. For we move at
will not only those members which are furnished with joints
of solid bone, as the hands, feet, and fingers, but we move also
at will those which are composed of slack and soft nerves: we
can put them in motion, or stretch them out, or bend and
twist them, or contract and stiffen them, as we do with the
muscles of the mouth and face. The lungs, which are the
very tenderest of the viscera except the brain, and are therefore
carefully sheltered in the cavity of the chest, yet for all
purposes of inhaling and exhaling the breath, and of uttering
and modulating the voice, are obedient to the will when we
breathe, exhale, speak, shout, or sing, just as the bellows obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the smith or the organist. I will not press the fact that some
animals have a natural power to move a single spot of the
skin with which their whole body is covered, if they have felt
on it anything they wish to drive off,&mdash;a power so great, that
by this shivering tremor of the skin they can not only shake
off flies that have settled on them, but even spears that have
fixed in their flesh. Man, it is true, has not this power; but
is this any reason for supposing that God could not give it to
such creatures as He wished to possess it? And therefore
man himself also might very well have enjoyed absolute
power over his members had he not forfeited it by his disobedience;
for it was not difficult for God to form him so
that what is now moved in his body only by lust should have
been moved only at will.</p>

<p>We know, too, that some men are differently constituted
from others, and have some rare and remarkable faculty of
doing with their body what other men can by no effort do,
and, indeed, scarcely believe when they hear of others doing.
There are persons who can move their ears, either one at a
time, or both together. There are some who, without moving
the head, can bring the hair down upon the forehead, and
move the whole scalp backwards and forwards at pleasure.
Some, by lightly pressing their stomach, bring up an incredible
quantity and variety of things they have swallowed, and produce
whatever they please, quite whole, as if out of a bag.
Some so accurately mimic the voices of birds and beasts and
other men, that, unless they are seen, the difference cannot be
told. Some have such command of their bowels, that they
can break wind continuously at pleasure, so as to produce
the effect of singing. I myself have known a man who was
accustomed to sweat whenever he wished. It is well known
that some weep when they please, and shed a flood of tears.
But far more incredible is that which some of our brethren
saw quite recently. There was a presbyter called Restitutus,
in the parish of the Calamensian<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Church, who, as often as he
pleased (and he was asked to do this by those who desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
witness so remarkable a phenomenon), on some one imitating
the wailings of mourners, became so insensible, and lay in a
state so like death, that not only had he no feeling when they
pinched and pricked him, but even when fire was applied to
him, and he was burned by it, he had no sense of pain except
afterwards from the wound. And that his body remained
motionless, not by reason of his self-command, but because
he was insensible, was proved by the fact that he breathed
no more than a dead man; and yet he said that, when any one
spoke with more than ordinary distinctness, he heard the voice,
but as if it were a long way off. Seeing, then, that even in
this mortal and miserable life the body serves some men by
many remarkable movements and moods beyond the ordinary
course of nature, what reason is there for doubting that, before
man was involved by his sin in this weak and corruptible
condition, his members might have served his will for the
propagation of offspring without lust? Man has been given
over to himself because he abandoned God, while he sought
to be self-satisfying; and disobeying God, he could not obey
even himself. Hence it is that he is involved in the obvious
misery of being unable to live as he wishes. For if he lived
as he wished, he would think himself blessed; but he could
not be so if he lived wickedly.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of true blessedness, which this present life cannot enjoy.</i></p>

<p>However, if we look at this a little more closely, we see
that no one lives as he wishes but the blessed, and that no
one is blessed but the righteous. But even the righteous
himself does not live as he wishes, until he has arrived where
he cannot die, be deceived, or injured, and until he is assured
that this shall be his eternal condition. For this nature demands;
and nature is not fully and perfectly blessed till it
attains what it seeks. But what man is at present able to
live as he wishes, when it is not in his power so much as to
live? He wishes to live, he is compelled to die. How, then,
does he live as he wishes who does not live as long as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
wishes? or if he wishes to die, how can he live as he wishes,
since he does not wish even to live? Or if he wishes to die,
not because he dislikes life, but that after death he may live
better, still he is not yet living as he wishes, but only has the
prospect of so living when, through death, he reaches that
which he wishes. But admit that he lives as he wishes,
because he has done violence to himself, and forced himself
not to wish what he cannot obtain, and to wish only what he
can (as Terence has it, "Since you cannot do what you will,
will what you can"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>), is he therefore blessed because he is
patiently wretched? For a blessed life is possessed only by
the man who loves it. If it is loved and possessed, it must
necessarily be more ardently loved than all besides; for whatever
else is loved must be loved for the sake of the blessed
life. And if it is loved as it deserves to be,&mdash;and the man
is not blessed who does not love the blessed life as it deserves,&mdash;then
he who so loves it cannot but wish it to be eternal.
Therefore it shall then only be blessed when it is eternal.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That we are to believe that in Paradise our first parents begat offspring
without blushing.</i></p>

<p>In Paradise, then, man lived as he desired so long as he
desired what God had commanded. He lived in the enjoyment
of God, and was good by God's goodness; he lived without any
want, and had it in his power so to live eternally. He had
food that he might not hunger, drink that he might not thirst,
the tree of life that old age might not waste him. There was
in his body no corruption, nor seed of corruption, which could
produce in him any unpleasant sensation. He feared no inward
disease, no outward accident. Soundest health blessed
his body, absolute tranquillity his soul. As in Paradise there
was no excessive heat or cold, so its inhabitants were exempt
from the vicissitudes of fear and desire. No sadness of any
kind was there, nor any foolish joy; true gladness ceaselessly
flowed from the presence of God, who was loved "out of a
pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>

We speak of things which are now shameful, and
although we try, as well as we are able, to conceive them as
they were before they became shameful, yet necessity compels
us rather to limit our discussion to the bounds set by
modesty than to extend it as our moderate faculty of discourse
might suggest. For since that which I have been
speaking of was not experienced even by those who might
have experienced it,&mdash;I mean our first parents (for sin and its
merited banishment from Paradise anticipated this passionless
generation on their part),&mdash;when sexual intercourse is spoken
of now, it suggests to men's thoughts not such a placid obedience
to the will as is conceivable in our first parents, but
such violent acting of lust as they themselves have experienced.
And therefore modesty shuts my mouth, although my mind
conceives the matter clearly. But Almighty God, the supreme
and supremely good Creator of all natures, who aids and rewards
good wills, while He abandons and condemns the bad,
and rules both, was not destitute of a plan by which He
might people His city with the fixed number of citizens which
His wisdom had foreordained even out of the condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
human race, discriminating them not now by merits, since
the whole mass was condemned as if in a vitiated root, but
by grace, and showing, not only in the case of the redeemed,
but also in those who were not delivered, how much grace
He has bestowed upon them. For every one acknowledges
that he has been rescued from evil, not by deserved, but by
gratuitous goodness, when he is singled out from the company
of those with whom he might justly have borne a common
punishment, and is allowed to go scathless. Why, then,
should God not have created those whom He foresaw would
sin, since He was able to show in and by them both what their
guilt merited, and what His grace bestowed, and since, under
His creating and disposing hand, even the perverse disorder
of the wicked could not pervert the right order of things?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the angels and men who sinned, and that their wickedness did not
disturb the order of God's providence.</i></p>

<p>The sins of men and angels do nothing to impede the
"great works of the Lord which accomplish His will."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> For
He who by His providence and omnipotence distributes to
every one his own portion, is able to make good use not only
of the good, but also of the wicked. And thus making a
good use of the wicked angel, who, in punishment of his first
wicked volition, was doomed to an obduracy that prevents
him now from willing any good, why should not God have
permitted him to tempt the first man, who had been created
upright, that is to say, with a good will? For he had been
so constituted, that if he looked to God for help, man's goodness
should defeat the angel's wickedness; but if by proud
self-pleasing he abandoned God, his Creator and Sustainer,
he should be conquered. If his will remained upright,
through leaning on God's help, he should be rewarded; if it
became wicked, by forsaking God, he should be punished.
But even this trusting in God's help could not itself be
accomplished without God's help, although man had it in his
own power to relinquish the benefits of divine grace by pleasing
himself. For as it is not in our power to live in this
world without sustaining ourselves by food, while it is in our
power to refuse this nourishment and cease to live, as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
do who kill themselves, so it was not in man's power, even in
Paradise, to live as he ought without God's help; but it was
in his power to live wickedly, though thus he should cut
short his happiness, and incur very just punishment. Since,
then, God was not ignorant that man would fall, why should
He not have suffered him to be tempted by an angel who
hated and envied him? It was not, indeed, that He was
unaware that he should be conquered, but because He foresaw
that by the man's seed, aided by divine grace, this same devil
himself should be conquered, to the greater glory of the
saints. All was brought about in such a manner, that neither
did any future event escape God's foreknowledge, nor did His
foreknowledge compel any one to sin, and so as to demonstrate
in the experience of the intelligent creation, human
and angelic, how great a difference there is between the
private presumption of the creature and the Creator's protection.
For who will dare to believe or say that it was not in
God's power to prevent both angels and men from sinning?
But God preferred to leave this in their power, and thus to
show both what evil could be wrought by their pride, and
what good by His grace.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>Of the nature of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly.</i></p>

<p>Accordingly, two cities have been formed by two loves:
the earthly by the love of self, even to the contempt of God;
the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of
self. The former, in a word, glories in itself, the latter in
the Lord. For the one seeks glory from men; but the
greatest glory of the other is God, the witness of conscience.
The one lifts up its head in its own glory; the other
says to its God, "Thou art my glory, and the lifter up of
mine head."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In the one, the princes and the nations it
subdues are ruled by the love of ruling; in the other, the
princes and the subjects serve one another in love, the latter
obeying, while the former take thought for all. The one
delights in its own strength, represented in the persons of its
rulers; the other says to its God, "I will love Thee, O Lord,
my strength."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> And therefore the wise men of the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
city, living according to man, have sought for profit to their
own bodies or souls, or both, and those who have known
God "glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful, but
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
darkened; professing themselves to be wise,"&mdash;that is, glorying
in their own wisdom, and being possessed by pride,&mdash;"they
became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God
into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
four-footed beasts, and creeping things." For they were
either leaders or followers of the people in adoring images,
"and worshipped and served the creature more than the
Creator, who is blessed for ever."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> But in the other city
there is no human wisdom, but only godliness, which offers
due worship to the true God, and looks for its reward in the
society of the saints, of holy angels as well as holy men,
"that God may be all in all."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Of the two lines of the human race which from first to last divide it.</i></p>

<p>OF the bliss of Paradise, of Paradise itself, and of the life
of our first parents there, and of their sin and punishment,
many have thought much, spoken much, written much.
We ourselves, too, have spoken of these things in the foregoing
books, and have written either what we read in the
Holy Scriptures, or what we could reasonably deduce from
them. And were we to enter into a more detailed investigation
of these matters, an endless number of endless questions
would arise, which would involve us in a larger work than the
present occasion admits. We cannot be expected to find
room for replying to every question that may be started by
unoccupied and captious men, who are ever more ready to ask
questions than capable of understanding the answer. Yet I
trust we have already done justice to these great and difficult
questions regarding the beginning of the world, or of the soul,
or of the human race itself. This race we have distributed
into two parts, the one consisting of those who live according
to man, the other of those who live according to God. And
these we also mystically call the two cities, or the two communities
of men, of which the one is predestined to reign
eternally with God, and the other to suffer eternal punishment
with the devil. This, however, is their end, and of it
we are to speak afterwards. At present, as we have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
enough about their origin, whether among the angels, whose
numbers we know not, or in the two first human beings, it
seems suitable to attempt an account of their career, from the
time when our two first parents began to propagate the race
until all human generation shall cease. For this whole time
or world-age, in which the dying give place and those who
are born succeed, is the career of these two cities concerning
which we treat.</p>

<p>Of these two first parents of the human race, then, Cain
was the first-born, and he belonged to the city of men; after
him was born Abel, who belonged to the city of God. For
as in the individual the truth of the apostle's statement is
discerned, "that is not first which is spiritual, but that which
is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,"<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> whence
it comes to pass that each man, being derived from a condemned
stock, is first of all born of Adam evil and carnal,
and becomes good and spiritual only afterwards, when he is
grafted into Christ by regeneration: so was it in the human
race as a whole. When these two cities began to run their
course by a series of deaths and births, the citizen of this
world was the first-born, and after him the stranger in this
world, the citizen of the city of God, predestinated by grace,
elected by grace, by grace a stranger below, and by grace a
citizen above. By grace,&mdash;for so far as regards himself he is
sprung from the same mass, all of which is condemned in its
origin; but God, like a potter (for this comparison is introduced
by the apostle judiciously, and not without thought),
of the same lump made one vessel to honour, another to dishonour.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
But first the vessel to dishonour was made, and
after it another to honour. For in each individual, as I have
already said, there is first of all that which is reprobate, that
from which we must begin, but in which we need not necessarily
remain; afterwards is that which is well-approved, to
which we may by advancing attain, and in which, when we
have reached it, we may abide. Not, indeed, that every
wicked man shall be good, but that no one will be good who
was not first of all wicked; but the sooner any one becomes
a good man, the more speedily does he receive this title, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
abolish the old name in the new. Accordingly, it is recorded
of Cain that he built a city,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> but Abel, being a sojourner,
built none. For the city of the saints is above, although
here below it begets citizens, in whom it sojourns till the
time of its reign arrives, when it shall gather together all in
the day of the resurrection; and then shall the promised
kingdom be given to them, in which they shall reign with
their Prince, the King of the ages, time without end.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the children of the flesh and the children of the promise.</i></p>

<p>There was indeed on earth, so long as it was needed, a
symbol and foreshadowing image of this city, which served
the purpose of reminding men that such a city was to be,
rather than of making it present; and this image was itself
called the holy city, as a symbol of the future city, though
not itself the reality. Of this city which served as an image,
and of that free city it typified, Paul writes to the Galatians
in these terms: "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law,
do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham
had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free
woman. But he who was of the bond woman was born after
the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise. Which
things are an allegory:<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and
answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with
her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is
the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren
that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:
for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath
an husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children
of promise. But as then he that was born after the
flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it
is now. Nevertheless, what saith the Scripture? Cast out
the bond woman and her son: for the son of the bond woman
shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. And
we, brethren, are not children of the bond woman, but of
the free, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
This interpretation of the passage, handed down to us with
apostolic authority, shows how we ought to understand the
Scriptures of the two covenants&mdash;the old and the new. One
portion of the earthly city became an image of the heavenly
city, not having a significance of its own, but signifying
another city, and therefore serving, or "being in bondage."
For it was founded not for its own sake, but to prefigure
another city; and this shadow of a city was also itself foreshadowed
by another preceding figure. For Sarah's handmaid
Agar, and her son, were an image of this image. And as the
shadows were to pass away when the full light came, Sarah,
the free woman, who prefigured the free city (which again was
also prefigured in another way by that shadow of a city Jerusalem),
therefore said, "Cast out the bond woman and her son;
for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with my
son Isaac," or, as the apostle says, "with the son of the free
woman." In the earthly city, then, we find two things&mdash;its
own obvious presence, and its symbolic presentation of the
heavenly city. Now citizens are begotten to the earthly city
by nature vitiated by sin, but to the heavenly city by grace freeing
nature from sin; whence the former are called "vessels of
wrath," the latter "vessels of mercy."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> And this was typified
in the two sons of Abraham,&mdash;Ishmael, the son of Agar the
handmaid, being born according to the flesh, while Isaac was
born of the free woman Sarah, according to the promise. Both,
indeed, were of Abraham's seed; but the one was begotten by
natural law, the other was given by gracious promise. In the
one birth, human action is revealed; in the other, a divine
kindness comes to light.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>That Sarah's barrenness was made productive by God's grace.</i></p>

<p>Sarah, in fact, was barren; and, despairing of offspring, and
being resolved that she would have at least through her handmaid
that blessing she saw she could not in her own person
procure, she gave her handmaid to her husband, to whom she
herself had been unable to bear children. From him she required
this conjugal duty, exercising her own right in another's
womb. And thus Ishmael was born according to the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
law of human generation, by sexual intercourse. Therefore it
is said that he was born "according to the flesh,"&mdash;not because
such births are not the gifts of God, nor His handiwork, whose
creative wisdom "reaches," as it is written, "from one end to
another mightily, and sweetly doth she order all things,"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
but because, in a case in which the gift of God, which was
not due to men and was the gratuitous largess of grace, was
to be conspicuous, it was requisite that a son be given in
a way which no effort of nature could compass. Nature
denies children to persons of the age which Abraham and
Sarah had now reached; besides that, in Sarah's case, she was
barren even in her prime. This nature, so constituted that
offspring could not be looked for, symbolized the nature of
the human race vitiated by sin and by just consequence condemned,
which deserves no future felicity. Fitly, therefore,
does Isaac, the child of promise, typify the children of grace,
the citizens of the free city, who dwell together in everlasting
peace, in which self-love and self-will have no place, but a
ministering love that rejoices in the common joy of all, of
many hearts makes one, that is to say, secures a perfect
concord.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the conflict and peace of the earthly city.</i></p>

<p>But the earthly city, which shall not be everlasting (for it
will no longer be a city when it has been committed to the
extreme penalty), has its good in this world, and rejoices in
it with such joy as such things can afford. But as this is
not a good which can discharge its devotees of all distresses,
this city is often divided against itself by litigations, wars,
quarrels, and such victories as are either life-destroying or
short-lived. For each part of it that arms against another
part of it seeks to triumph over the nations through itself in
bondage to vice. If, when it has conquered, it is inflated with
pride, its victory is life-destroying; but if it turns its thoughts
upon the common casualties of our mortal condition, and is
rather anxious concerning the disasters that may befall it
than elated with the successes already achieved, this victory,
though of a higher kind, is still only short-lived; for it cannot
abidingly rule over those whom it has victoriously subjugated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
But the things which this city desires cannot justly
be said to be evil, for it is itself, in its own kind, better than
all other human good. For it desires earthly peace for the
sake of enjoying earthly goods, and it makes war in order to
attain to this peace; since, if it has conquered, and there
remains no one to resist it, it enjoys a peace which it had not
while there were opposing parties who contested for the enjoyment
of those things which were too small to satisfy both.
This peace is purchased by toilsome wars; it is obtained by
what they style a glorious victory. Now, when victory remains
with the party which had the juster cause, who hesitates
to congratulate the victor, and style it a desirable peace?
These things, then, are good things, and without doubt the
gifts of God. But if they neglect the better things of the
heavenly city, which are secured by eternal victory and peace
never-ending, and so inordinately covet these present good
things that they believe them to be the only desirable things,
or love them better than those things which are believed to
be better,&mdash;if this be so, then it is necessary that misery
follow and ever increase.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the fratricidal act of the founder of the earthly city, and the corresponding
crime of the founder of Rome.</i></p>

<p>Thus the founder of the earthly city was a fratricide.
Overcome with envy, he slew his own brother, a citizen of
the eternal city, and a sojourner on earth. So that we cannot
be surprised that this first specimen, or, as the Greeks say,
archetype of crime, should, long afterwards, find a corresponding
crime at the foundation of that city which was destined
to reign over so many nations, and be the head of this earthly
city of which we speak. For of that city also, as one of their
poets has mentioned, "the first walls were stained with a
brother's blood,"<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> or, as Roman history records, Remus was
slain by his brother Romulus. And thus there is no difference
between the foundation of this city and of the earthly
city, unless it be that Romulus and Remus were both citizens
of the earthly city. Both desired to have the glory of founding
the Roman republic, but both could not have as much
glory as if one only claimed it; for he who wished to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the glory of ruling would certainly rule less if his power were
shared by a living consort. In order, therefore, that the
whole glory might be enjoyed by one, his consort was removed;
and by this crime the empire was made larger indeed,
but inferior, while otherwise it would have been less, but
better. Now these brothers, Cain and Abel, were not both
animated by the same earthly desires, nor did the murderer
envy the other because he feared that, by both ruling, his own
dominion would be curtailed,&mdash;for Abel was not solicitous to
rule in that city which his brother built,&mdash;he was moved by
that diabolical, envious hatred with which the evil regard the
good, for no other reason than because they are good while
themselves are evil. For the possession of goodness is by no
means diminished by being shared with a partner either permanent
or temporarily assumed; on the contrary, the possession
of goodness is increased in proportion to the concord and
charity of each of those who share it. In short, he who is
unwilling to share this possession cannot have it; and he who
is most willing to admit others to a share of it will have the
greatest abundance to himself. The quarrel, then, between
Romulus and Remus shows how the earthly city is divided
against itself; that which fell out between Cain and Abel
illustrated the hatred that subsists between the two cities, that
of God and that of men. The wicked war with the wicked;
the good also war with the wicked. But with the good, good
men, or at least perfectly good men, cannot war; though,
while only going on towards perfection, they war to this extent,
that every good man resists others in those points in
which he resists himself. And in each individual "the flesh
lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
This spiritual lusting, therefore, can be at war with the carnal
lust of another man; or carnal lust may be at war with the
spiritual desires of another, in some such way as good and
wicked men are at war; or, still more certainly, the carnal
lusts of two men, good but not yet perfect, contend together,
just as the wicked contend with the wicked, until the health
of those who are under the treatment of grace attains final
victory.</p>

no man can see the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> many precepts are given which
carefully inculcate mutual forgiveness; among which we may
number that terrible word in which the servant is ordered to
pay his formerly remitted debt of ten thousand talents, because
he did not remit to his fellow-servant his debt of two hundred
pence. To which parable the Lord Jesus added the words, "So
likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from
your hearts forgive not every one his brother."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It is thus
the citizens of the city of God are healed while still they sojourn
in this earth and sigh for the peace of their heavenly
country. The Holy Spirit, too, works within, that the medicine
externally applied may have some good result. Otherwise,
even though God Himself make use of the creatures
that are subject to Him, and in some human form address our
human senses, whether we receive those impressions in sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
or in some external appearance, still, if He does not by His
own inward grace sway and act upon the mind, no preaching
of the truth is of any avail. But this God does, distinguishing
between the vessels of wrath and the vessels of mercy, by
His own very secret but very just providence. When He
Himself aids the soul in His own hidden and wonderful ways,
and the sin which dwells in our members, and is, as the
apostle teaches, rather the punishment of sin, does not reign
in our mortal body to obey the lusts of it, and when we no
longer yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
then the soul is converted from its own evil and selfish desires,
and, God possessing it, it possesses itself in peace even
in this life, and afterwards, with perfected health and endowed
with immortality, will reign without sin in peace everlasting.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the cause of Cain's crime and his obstinacy, which not even the word of
God could subdue.</i></p>

<p>But though God made use of this very mode of address
which we have been endeavouring to explain, and spoke to
Cain in that form by which He was wont to accommodate
Himself to our first parents and converse with them as a
companion, what good influence had it on Cain? Did he not
fulfil his wicked intention of killing his brother even after
he was warned by God's voice? For when God had made a
distinction between their sacrifices, neglecting Cain's, regarding
Abel's, which was doubtless intimated by some visible
sign to that effect; and when God had done so because the
works of the one were evil but those of his brother good, Cain
was very wroth, and his countenance fell. For thus it is
written: "And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth,
and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly,
but dost not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned? Fret
not thyself, for unto thee shall be his turning, and thou shalt
rule over him."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In this admonition administered by God to
Cain, that clause indeed, "If thou offerest rightly, but dost
not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned?" is obscure, inasmuch
as it is not apparent for what reason or purpose it was
spoken, and many meanings have been put upon it, as each
one who discusses it attempts to interpret it according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
rule of faith. The truth is, that a sacrifice is "rightly offered"
when it is offered to the true God, to whom alone we must
sacrifice. And it is "not rightly distinguished" when we do
not rightly distinguish the places or seasons or materials of
the offering, or the person offering, or the person to whom it
is presented, or those to whom it is distributed for food after
the oblation. Distinguishing<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> is here used for discriminating,&mdash;whether
when an offering is made in a place where it ought
not or of a material which ought to be offered not there but
elsewhere; or when an offering is made at a wrong time, or
of a material suitable not then but at some other time; or when
that is offered which in no place nor any time ought to be
offered; or when a man keeps to himself choicer specimens
of the same kind than he offers to God; or when he or any
other who may not lawfully partake profanely eats of the oblation.
In which of these particulars Cain displeased God, it is
difficult to determine. But the Apostle John, speaking of
these brothers, says, "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked
one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because
his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
He thus gives us to understand that God did not respect his
offering because it was not rightly "distinguished" in this, that
he gave to God something of his own but kept himself to himself.
For this all do who follow not God's will but their
own, who live not with an upright but a crooked heart, and
yet offer to God such gifts as they suppose will procure from
Him that He aid them not by healing but by gratifying their
evil passions. And this is the characteristic of the earthly
city, that it worships God or gods who may aid it in reigning
victoriously and peacefully on earth not through love of doing
good, but through lust of rule. The good use the world that
they may enjoy God: the wicked, on the contrary, that they
may enjoy the world would fain use God,&mdash;those of them, at
least, who have attained to the belief that He is and takes an
interest in human affairs. For they who have not yet attained
even to this belief are still at a much lower level. Cain, then,
when he saw that God had respect to his brother's sacrifice,
but not to his own, should have humbly chosen his good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
brother as his example, and not proudly counted him his
rival. But he was wroth, and his countenance fell. This angry
regret for another person's goodness, even his brother's, was
charged upon him by God as a great sin. And He accused him
of it in the interrogation, "Why art thou wroth, and why is thy
countenance fallen?" For God saw that he envied his brother,
and of this He accused him. For to men, from whom the
heart of their fellow is hid, it might be doubtful and quite
uncertain whether that sadness bewailed his own wickedness
by which, as he had learned, he had displeased God, or his
brother's goodness, which had pleased God, and won His
favourable regard to his sacrifice. But God, in giving the
reason why He refused to accept Cain's offering and why
Cain should rather have been displeased at himself than at
his brother, shows him that though he was unjust in "not
rightly distinguishing," that is, not rightly living and being
unworthy to have his offering received, he was more unjust by
far in hating his just brother without a cause.</p>

<p>Yet He does not dismiss him without counsel, holy, just,
and good. "Fret not thyself," He says, "for unto thee shall
be his turning, and thou shalt rule over him." Over his
brother, does He mean? Most certainly not. Over what, then,
but sin? For He had said, "Thou hast sinned," and then
He added, "Fret not thyself, for to thee shall be its turning,
and thou shalt rule over it."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> And the "turning" of sin to
the man can be understood of his conviction that the guilt of
sin can be laid at no other man's door but his own. For this
is the health-giving medicine of penitence, and the fit plea
for pardon; so that, when it is said, "To thee its turning," we
must not supply "shall be," but we must read, "To thee let its
turning be," understanding it as a command, not as a prediction.
For then shall a man rule over his sin when he does
not prefer it to himself and defend it, but subjects it by repentance;
otherwise he that becomes protector of it shall surely
become its prisoner. But if we understand this sin to be that
carnal concupiscence of which the apostle says, "The flesh
lusteth against the spirit,"<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> among the fruits of which lust he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
names envy, by which assuredly Cain was stung and excited
to destroy his brother, then we may properly supply the
words "shall be," and read, "To thee shall be its turning, and
thou shalt rule over it." For when the carnal part which the
apostle calls sin, in that place where he says, "It is not I who
do it, but sin that dwelleth in me,"<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> that part which the
philosophers also call vicious, and which ought not to lead the
mind, but which the mind ought to rule and restrain by reason
from illicit motions,&mdash;when, then, this part has been moved to
perpetrate any wickedness, if it be curbed and if it obey the
word of the apostle, "Yield not your members instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin,"<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> it is turned towards the mind and
subdued and conquered by it, so that reason rules over it as
a subject. It was this which God enjoined on him who was
kindled with the fire of envy against his brother, so that he
sought to put out of the way him whom he should have set
as an example. "Fret not thyself," or compose thyself, He
says: withhold thy hand from crime; let not sin reign in
your mortal body to fulfil it in the lusts thereof, nor yield
your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. "For
to thee shall be its turning," so long as you do not encourage
it by giving it the rein, but bridle it by quenching its fire.
"And thou shalt rule over it;" for when it is not allowed any
external actings, it yields itself to the rule of the governing
mind and righteous will, and ceases from even internal motions.
There is something similar said in the same divine
book of the woman, when God questioned and judged them
after their sin, and pronounced sentence on them all,&mdash;the devil
in the form of the serpent, the woman and her husband in
their own persons. For when He had said to her, "I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children," then He added, "and thy
turning shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
What is said to Cain about his sin, or about the vicious concupiscence
of his flesh, is here said of the woman who had
sinned; and we are to understand that the husband is to rule
his wife as the soul rules the flesh. And therefore, says the
apostle, "He that loveth his wife, loveth himself; for no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ever yet hated his own flesh."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> This flesh, then, is to be
healed, because it belongs to ourselves: is not to be abandoned
to destruction as if it were alien to our nature. But Cain received
that counsel of God in the spirit of one who did not
wish to amend. In fact, the vice of envy grew stronger in him;
and, having entrapped his brother, he slew him. Such was
the founder of the earthly city. He was also a figure of the
Jews who slew Christ the Shepherd of the flock of men, prefigured
by Abel the shepherd of sheep: but as this is an allegorical
and prophetical matter, I forbear to explain it now;
besides, I remember that I have made some remarks upon it
in writing against Faustus the Manichæan.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>


<p class="center">8. <i>What Cain's reason was for building a city so early in the history
of the human race.</i></p>

<p>At present it is the history which I aim at defending, that
Scripture may not be reckoned incredible when it relates that
one man built a city at a time in which there seem to have
been but four men upon earth, or rather indeed but three,
after one brother slew the other,&mdash;to wit, the first man the
father of all, and Cain himself, and his son Enoch, by whose
name the city was itself called. But they who are moved by
this consideration forget to take into account that the writer
of the sacred history does not necessarily mention all the
men who might be alive at that time, but those only whom
the scope of his work required him to name. The design of
that writer (who in this matter was the instrument of the
Holy Ghost) was to descend to Abraham through the successions
of ascertained generations propagated from one man,
and then to pass from Abraham's seed to the people of God,
in whom, separated as they were from other nations, was
prefigured and predicted all that relates to the city whose
reign is eternal, and to its king and founder Christ, which
things were foreseen in the Spirit as destined to come; yet
neither is this object so effected as that nothing is said of the
other society of men which we call the earthly city, but
mention is made of it so far as seemed needful to enhance
the glory of the heavenly city by contrast to its opposite.
Accordingly, when the divine Scripture, in mentioning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
number of years which those men lived, concludes its account
of each man of whom it speaks, with the words, "And he
begat sons and daughters, and all his days were so and so,
and he died," are we to understand that, because it does not
name those sons and daughters, therefore, during that long
term of years over which one lifetime extended in those early
days, there might not have been born very many men, by
whose united numbers not one but several cities might have
been built? But it suited the purpose of God, by whose
inspiration these histories were composed, to arrange and distinguish
from the first these two societies in their several
generations,&mdash;that on the one side the generations of men,
that is to say, of those who live according to man, and on the
other side the generations of the sons of God, that is to
say, of men living according to God, might be traced down
together and yet apart from one another as far as the deluge,
at which point their dissociation and association are exhibited:
their dissociation, inasmuch as the generations of both lines
are recorded in separate tables, the one line descending from
the fratricide Cain, the other from Seth, who had been born to
Adam instead of him whom his brother slew; their association,
inasmuch as the good so deteriorated that the whole race
became of such a character that it was swept away by the
deluge, with the exception of one just man, whose name was
Noah, and his wife and three sons and three daughters-in-law,
which eight persons were alone deemed worthy to escape
from that desolating visitation which destroyed all men.</p>

<p>Therefore, although it is written, "And Cain knew his wife,
and she conceived and bare Enoch, and he builded a city and
called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch,"<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
it does not follow that we are to believe this to have been
his first-born; for we cannot suppose that this is proved by
the expression "he knew his wife," as if then for the first
time he had had intercourse with her. For in the case of
Adam, the father of all, this expression is used not only when
Cain, who seems to have been his first-born, was conceived,
but also afterwards the same Scripture says, "Adam knew
Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare a son, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
called his name Seth."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Whence it is obvious that Scripture
employs this expression neither always when a birth is recorded
nor then only when the birth of a first-born is mentioned.
Neither is it necessary to suppose that Enoch was
Cain's first-born because he named his city after him. For
it is quite possible that though he had other sons, yet for
some reason the father loved him more than the rest. Judah
was not the first-born, though he gives his name to Judæa
and the Jews. But even though Enoch was the first-born of
the city's founder, that is no reason for supposing that the
father named the city after him as soon as he was born; for
at that time he, being but a solitary man, could not have
founded a civic community, which is nothing else than a
multitude of men bound together by some associating tie.
But when his family increased to such numbers that he had
quite a population, then it became possible to him both to
build a city, and give it, when founded, the name of his son.
For so long was the life of those antediluvians, that he who
lived the shortest time of those whose years are mentioned in
Scripture attained to the age of 753 years.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> And though no
one attained the age of a thousand years, several exceeded the
age of nine hundred. Who then can doubt that during the
lifetime of one man the human race might be so multiplied that
there would be a population to build and occupy not one but
several cities? And this might very readily be conjectured
from the fact that from one man, Abraham, in not much more
than four hundred years, the numbers of the Hebrew race so
increased, that in the exodus of that people from Egypt there
are recorded to have been six hundred thousand men capable
of bearing arms,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and this over and above the Idumæans, who,
though not numbered with Israel's descendants, were yet sprung
from his brother, also a grandson of Abraham; and over and
above the other nations which were of the same stock of
Abraham, though not through Sarah,&mdash;that is, his descendants
by Hagar and Keturah, the Ishmaelites, Midianites, etc.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of the long life and greater stature of the antediluvians.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore no one who considerately weighs facts will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
doubt that Cain might have built a city, and that a large
one, when it is observed how prolonged were the lives of
men, unless perhaps some sceptic take exception to this very
length of years which our authors ascribe to the antediluvians
and deny that this is credible. And so, too, they do
not believe that the size of men's bodies was larger then than
now, though the most esteemed of their own poets, Virgil,
asserts the same, when he speaks of that huge stone which
had been fixed as a landmark, and which a strong man of
those ancient times snatched up as he fought, and ran, and
hurled, and cast it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scarce twelve strong men of later mould<br /></span>

<p>thus declaring his opinion that the earth then produced
mightier men. And if in the more recent times, how much
more in the ages before the world-renowned deluge? But
the large size of the primitive human body is often proved to
the incredulous by the exposure of sepulchres, either through
the wear of time or the violence of torrents or some accident,
and in which bones of incredible size have been found or have
rolled out. I myself, along with some others, saw on the
shore at Utica a man's molar tooth of such a size, that if it
were cut down into teeth such as we have, a hundred, I
fancy, could have been made out of it. But that, I believe,
belonged to some giant. For though the bodies of ordinary
men were then larger than ours, the giants surpassed all in
stature. And neither in our own age nor any other have
there been altogether wanting instances of gigantic stature,
though they may be few. The younger Pliny, a most learned
man, maintains that the older the world becomes, the smaller
will be the bodies of men.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And he mentions that Homer
in his poems often lamented the same decline; and this he
does not laugh at as a poetical figment, but in his character
of a recorder of natural wonders accepts it as historically true.
But, as I said, the bones which are from time to time discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
prove the size of the bodies of the ancients,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and will
do so to future ages, for they are slow to decay. But the
length of an antediluvian's life cannot now be proved by any
such monumental evidence. But we are not on this account
to withhold our faith from the sacred history, whose statements
of past fact we are the more inexcusable in discrediting,
as we see the accuracy of its prediction of what was future.
And even that same Pliny<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> tells us that there is still a nation
in which men live 200 years. If, then, in places unknown
to us, men are believed to have a length of days which is
quite beyond our own experience, why should we not believe
the same of times distant from our own? Or are we to
believe that in other places there is what is not here, while
we do not believe that in other times there has been anything
but what is now?</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the different computation of the ages of the antediluvians, given by the
Hebrew manuscripts and by our own.</i><a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Wherefore, although there is a discrepancy for which I
cannot account between our manuscripts and the Hebrew, in
the very number of years assigned to the antediluvians, yet
the discrepancy is not so great that they do not agree about
their longevity. For the very first man, Adam, before he
begot his son Seth, is in our manuscripts found to have lived
230 years, but in the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span> 130. But after he begot
Seth, our copies read that he lived 700 years, while the
Hebrew give 800. And thus, when the two periods are taken
together, the sum agrees. And so throughout the succeeding
generations, the period before the father begets a son is always
made shorter by 100 years in the Hebrew, but the period
after his son is begotten is longer by 100 years in the
Hebrew than in our copies. And thus, taking the two periods
together, the result is the same in both. And in the sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
generation there is no discrepancy at all. In the seventh,
however, of which Enoch is the representative, who is recorded
to have been translated without death because he
pleased God, there is the same discrepancy as in the first
five generations, 100 years more being ascribed to him by
our <span class="smcap">mss.</span> before he begat a son. But still the result agrees;
for according to both documents he lived before he was
translated 365 years. In the eighth generation the discrepancy
is less than in the others, and of a different kind. For
Methuselah, whom Enoch begat, lived, before he begat his
successor, not 100 years less, but 100 years more, according
to the Hebrew reading; and in our <span class="smcap">mss.</span> again these years
are added to the period after he begat his son; so that in this
case also the sum-total is the same. And it is only in the
ninth generation, that is, in the age of Lamech, Methuselah's
son and Noah's father, that there is a discrepancy in the sum-total;
and even in this case it is slight. For the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
represent him as living twenty-four years more than ours
assign to him. For before he begat his son, who was called
Noah, six years fewer are given to him by the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
than by ours; but after he begat this son, they give him thirty
years more than ours; so that, deducting the former six, there
remains, as we said, a surplus of twenty-four.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of Methuselah's age, which seems to extend fourteen years beyond the
deluge.</i></p>

<p>From this discrepancy between the Hebrew books and our
own arises the well-known question as to the age of Methuselah;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
for it is computed that he lived for fourteen years
after the deluge, though Scripture relates that of all who
were then upon the earth only the eight souls in the ark
escaped destruction by the flood, and of these Methuselah was
not one. For, according to our books, Methuselah, before he
begat the son whom he called Lamech, lived 167 years; then
Lamech himself, before his son Noah was born, lived 188
years, which together make 355 years. Add to these the
age of Noah at the date of the deluge, 600 years, and this
gives a total of 955 from the birth of Methuselah to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
year of the flood. Now all the years of the life of Methuselah
are computed to be 969; for when he had lived 167
years, and had begotten his son Lamech, he then lived after
this 802 years, which makes a total, as we said, of 969
years. From this, if we deduct 955 years from the birth of
Methuselah to the flood, there remain fourteen years, which
he is supposed to have lived after the flood. And therefore
some suppose that, though he was not on earth (in which it
is agreed that every living thing which could not naturally
live in water perished), he was for a time with his father,
who had been translated, and that he lived there till the flood
had passed away. This hypothesis they adopt, that they may
not cast a slight on the trustworthiness of versions which the
Church has received into a position of high authority,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and
because they believe that the Jewish <span class="smcap">mss.</span> rather than our
own are in error. For they do not admit that this is a mistake
of the translators, but maintain that there is a falsified
statement in the original, from which, through the Greek, the
Scripture has been translated into our own tongue. They say
that it is not credible that the seventy translators, who simultaneously
and unanimously produced one rendering, could
have erred, or, in a case in which no interest of theirs was
involved, could have falsified their translation; but that the
Jews, envying us our translation of their Law and Prophets,
have made alterations in their texts so as to undermine the
authority of ours. This opinion or suspicion let each man
adopt according to his own judgment. Certain it is that
Methuselah did not survive the flood, but died in the very
year it occurred, if the numbers given in the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
are true. My own opinion regarding the seventy translators
I will, with God's help, state more carefully in its
own place, when I have come down (following the order
which this work requires) to that period in which their
translation was executed.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> For the present question, it is
enough that, according to our versions, the men of that age
had lives so long as to make it quite possible that, during
the lifetime of the first-born of the two sole parents then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
on earth, the human race multiplied sufficiently to form a
community.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the opinion of those who do not believe that in these primitive times men
lived so long as is stated.</i></p>

<p>For they are by no means to be listened to who suppose
that in those times years were differently reckoned, and were
so short that one of our years may be supposed to be equal
to ten of theirs. So that they say, when we read or hear that
some man lived 900 years, we should understand ninety,&mdash;ten
of those years making but one of ours, and ten of ours
equalling 100 of theirs. Consequently, as they suppose,
Adam was twenty-three years of age when he begat Seth, and
Seth himself was twenty years and six months old when his
son Enos was born, though the Scripture calls these months
205 years. For, on the hypothesis of those whose opinion we
are explaining, it was customary to divide one such year as
we have into ten parts, and to call each part a year. And
each of these parts was composed of six days squared; because
God finished His works in six days, that He might rest the
seventh. Of this I disputed according to my ability in the
eleventh book.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Now six squared, or six times six, gives
thirty-six days; and this multiplied by ten amounts to 360
days, or twelve lunar months. As for the five remaining days
which are needed to complete the solar year, and for the
fourth part of a day, which requires that into every fourth or
leap-year a day be added, the ancients added such days as the
Romans used to call "intercalary," in order to complete the
number of the years. So that Enos, Seth's son, was nineteen
years old when his son Cainan was born, though Scripture
calls these years 190. And so through all the generations in
which the ages of the antediluvians are given, we find in our
versions that almost no one begat a son at the age of 100 or
under, or even at the age of 120 or thereabouts; but the
youngest fathers are recorded to have been 160 years old and
upwards. And the reason of this, they say, is that no one
can beget children when he is ten years old, the age spoken
of by those men as 100, but that sixteen is the age of puberty,
and competent now to propagate offspring; and this is the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
called by them 160. And that it may not be thought incredible
that in these days the year was differently computed
from our own, they adduce what is recorded by several writers
of history, that the Egyptians had a year of four months, the
Acarnanians of six, and the Lavinians of thirteen months.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
The younger Pliny, after mentioning that some writers reported
that one man had lived 152 years, another ten more,
others 200, others 300, that some had even reached 500 and
600, and a few 800 years of age, gave it as his opinion that
all this must be ascribed to mistaken computation. For some,
he says, make summer and winter each a year; others make
each season a year, like the Arcadians, whose years, he says,
were of three months. He added, too, that the Egyptians, of
whose little years of four months we have spoken already,
sometimes terminated their year at the wane of each moon;
so that with them there are produced lifetimes of 1000
years.</p>

<p>By these plausible arguments certain persons, with no desire
to weaken the credit of this sacred history, but rather to
facilitate belief in it by removing the difficulty of such incredible
longevity, have been themselves persuaded, and think
they act wisely in persuading others, that in these days the
year was so brief that ten of their years equal but one of ours,
while ten of ours equal 100 of theirs. But there is the
plainest evidence to show that this is quite false. Before
producing this evidence, however, it seems right to mention
a conjecture which is yet more plausible. From the Hebrew
manuscripts we could at once refute this confident statement;
for in them Adam is found to have lived not 230 but 130
years before he begat his third son. If, then, this mean
thirteen years by our ordinary computation, then he must
have begotten his first son when he was only twelve or thereabouts.
Who can at this age beget children according to the
ordinary and familiar course of nature? But not to mention
him, since it is possible he may have been able to beget his
like as soon as he was created,&mdash;for it is not credible that he was
created so little as our infants are,&mdash;not to mention him, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
son was not 205 years old when he begat Enos, as our versions
have it, but 105, and consequently, according to this
idea, was not eleven years old. But what shall I say of his
son Cainan, who, though by our version 170 years old, was by
the Hebrew text seventy when he beget Mahalaleel? If
seventy years in those times meant only seven of our years,
what man of seven years old begets children?</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether, in computing years, we ought to follow the Hebrew or the
Septuagint.</i></p>

<p>But if I say this, I shall presently be answered, It is one
of the Jews' lies. This, however, we have disposed of above,
showing that it cannot be that men of so just a reputation as
the seventy translators should have falsified their version.
However, if I ask them which of the two is more credible,
that the Jewish nation, scattered far and wide, could have
unanimously conspired to forge this lie, and so, through envying
others the authority of their Scriptures, have deprived
themselves of their verity; or that seventy men, who were
also themselves Jews, shut up in one place (for Ptolemy king
of Egypt had got them together for this work), should have
envied foreign nations that same truth, and by common consent
inserted these errors: who does not see which can be
more naturally and readily believed? But far be it from any
prudent man to believe either that the Jews, however malicious
and wrong-headed, could have tampered with so many
and so widely-dispersed manuscripts; or that those renowned
seventy individuals had any common purpose to grudge the
truth to the nations. One must therefore more plausibly
maintain, that when first their labours began to be transcribed
from the copy in Ptolemy's library, some such misstatement
might find its way into the first copy made, and from it might
be disseminated far and wide; and that this might arise from
no fraud, but from a mere copyist's error. This is a sufficiently
plausible account of the difficulty regarding Methuselah's life,
and of that other case in which there is a difference in the
total of twenty-four years. But in those cases in which there
is a methodical resemblance in the falsification, so that uniformly
the one version allots to the period before a son and
successor is born 100 years more than the other, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
period subsequent 100 years less, and <i>vice versâ</i>, so that the
totals may agree,&mdash;and this holds true of the first, second,
third, fourth, fifth, and seventh generations,&mdash;in these cases
error seems to have, if we may say so, a certain kind of constancy,
and savours not of accident, but of design.</p>

<p>Accordingly, that diversity of numbers which distinguishes
the Hebrew from the Greek and Latin copies of Scripture,
and which consists of a uniform addition and deduction of
100 years in each lifetime for several consecutive generations,
is to be attributed neither to the malice of the Jews
nor to men so diligent and prudent as the seventy translators,
but to the error of the copyist who was first allowed
to transcribe the manuscript from the library of the above-mentioned
king. For even now, in cases where numbers
contribute nothing to the easier comprehension or more satisfactory
knowledge of anything, they are both carelessly
transcribed, and still more carelessly emended. For who will
trouble himself to learn how many thousand men the several
tribes of Israel contained? He sees no resulting benefit of
such knowledge. Or how many men are there who are aware
of the vast advantage that lies hid in this knowledge? But in
this case, in which during so many consecutive generations
100 years are added in one manuscript where they are not
reckoned in the other, and then, after the birth of the son
and successor, the years which were wanting are added, it is
obvious that the copyist who contrived this arrangement designed
to insinuate that the antediluvians lived an excessive
number of years only because each year was excessively brief,
and that he tried to draw the attention to this fact by his
statement of their age of puberty at which they became able
to beget children. For, lest the incredulous might stumble
at the difficulty of so long a lifetime, he insinuated that
100 of their years equalled but ten of ours; and this insinuation
he conveyed by adding 100 years whenever
he found the age below 160 years or thereabouts, deducting
these years again from the period after the son's
birth, that the total might harmonize. By this means he
intended to ascribe the generation of offspring to a fit age,
without diminishing the total sum of years ascribed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
lifetime of the individuals. And the very fact that in the
sixth generation he departed from this uniform practice, inclines
us all the rather to believe that when the circumstance
we have referred to required his alterations, he made them;
seeing that when this circumstance did not exist, he made no
alteration. For in the same generation he found in the Hebrew
MS. that Jared lived before he begat Enoch 162 years, which,
according to the short year computation, is sixteen years and
somewhat less than two months, an age capable of procreation;
and therefore it was not necessary to add 100 short years,
and so make the age twenty-six years of the usual length;
and of course it was not necessary to deduct, after the son's
birth, years which he had not added before it. And thus it
comes to pass that in this instance there is no variation
between the two manuscripts.</p>

<p>This is corroborated still further by the fact that in the
eighth generation, while the Hebrew books assign 182<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
years to Methuselah before Lamech's birth, ours assign to
him twenty less, though usually 100 years are added to this
period; then, after Lamech's birth, the twenty years are restored,
so as to equalize the total in the two books. For if
his design was that these 170 years be understood as seventeen,
so as to suit the age of puberty, as there was no need
for him adding anything, so there was none for his subtracting
anything; for in this case he found an age fit for the generation
of children, for the sake of which he was in the habit of
adding those 100 years in cases where he did not find the
age already sufficient. This difference of twenty years we
might, indeed, have supposed had happened accidentally, had
he not taken care to restore them afterwards as he had
deducted them from the period before, so that there might
be no deficiency in the total. Or are we perhaps to suppose
that there was the still more astute design of concealing the
deliberate and uniform addition of 100 years to the first
period and their deduction from the subsequent period,&mdash;did
he design to conceal this by doing something similar, that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
say, adding and deducting, not indeed a century, but some
years, even in a case in which there was no need for his
doing so? But whatever may be thought of this, whether
it be believed that he did so or not, whether, in fine, it be
so or not, I would have no manner of doubt that when any
diversity is found in the books, since both cannot be true to
fact, we do well to believe in preference that language out
of which the translation was made into another by translators.
For there are three Greek <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, one Latin, and one Syriac,
which agree with one another, and in all of these Methuselah
is said to have died six years before the deluge.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>That the years in those ancient times were of the same length as our own.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see how it can be plainly made out that in the
enormously protracted lives of those men the years were not
so short that ten of their years were equal to only one of ours,
but were of as great length as our own, which are measured
by the course of the sun. It is proved by this, that Scripture
states that the flood occurred in the six hundredth year of
Noah's life. But why in the same place is it also written,
"The waters of the flood were upon the earth in the six
hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
twenty-seventh day of the month,"<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> if that very brief year (of
which it took ten to make one of ours) consisted of thirty-six
days? For so scant a year, if the ancient usage dignified
it with the name of year, either has not months, or its month
must be three days, so that it may have twelve of them. How
then was it here said, "In the six hundredth year, the second
month, the twenty-seventh day of the month," unless the
months then were of the same length as the months now?
For how else could it be said that the flood began on the
twenty-seventh day of the second month? Then afterwards,
at the end of the flood, it is thus written: "And the ark rested
in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
on the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually
until the eleventh month: on the first day of the
month were the tops of the mountains seen."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
months were such as we have, then so were the years. And
certainly months of three days each could not have a twenty-seventh
day. Or if every measure of time was diminished in
proportion, and a thirtieth part of three days was then called
a day, then that great deluge, which is recorded to have lasted
forty days and forty nights, was really over in less than four
of our days. Who can away with such foolishness and absurdity?
Far be this error from us,&mdash;an error which seeks to
build up our faith in the divine Scriptures on false conjecture,
only to demolish our faith at another point. It is plain that
the day then was what it now is, a space of four-and-twenty
hours, determined by the lapse of day and night; the month
then equal to the month now, which is defined by the rise
and completion of one moon; the year then equal to the year
now, which is completed by twelve lunar months, with the
addition of five days and a-fourth to adjust it with the course
of the sun. It was a year of this length which was reckoned
the six hundredth of Noah's life; and in the second month,
the twenty-seventh day of the month, the flood began,&mdash;a
flood which, as is recorded, was caused by heavy rains continuing
for forty days, which days had not only two hours
and a little more, but four-and-twenty hours, completing a
night and a day. And consequently those antediluvians lived
more than 900 years, which were years as long as those
which afterwards Abraham lived 175 of, and after him his
son Isaac 180, and his son Jacob nearly 150, and some time
after, Moses 120, and men now seventy or eighty, or not
much longer, of which years it is said, "their strength is
labour and sorrow."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>But that discrepancy of numbers which is found to exist
between our own and the Hebrew text does not touch the
longevity of the ancients; and if there is any diversity so
great that both versions cannot be true, we must take our
ideas of the real facts from that text out of which our own
version has been translated. However, though any one who
pleases has it in his power to correct this version, yet it is
not unimportant to observe that no one has presumed to
emend the Septuagint from the Hebrew text in the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
places where they seem to disagree. For this difference has
not been reckoned a falsification; and for my own part I am
persuaded it ought not to be reckoned so. But where the
difference is not a mere copyist's error, and where the sense is
agreeable to truth and illustrative of truth, we must believe
that the divine Spirit prompted them to give a varying version,
not in their function of translators, but in the liberty of prophesying.
And therefore we find that the apostles justly
sanction the Septuagint, by quoting it as well as the Hebrew
when they adduce proofs from the Scriptures. But as I have
promised to treat this subject more carefully, if God help me,
in a more fitting place, I will now go on with the matter in
hand. For there can be no doubt that, the lives of men being
so long, the first-born of the first man could have built a city,&mdash;a
city, however, which was earthly, and not that which is
called the city of God, to describe which we have taken in
hand this great work.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>Whether it is credible that the men of the primitive age abstained from
sexual intercourse until that date at which it is recorded that they begat
children.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some one, then, will say, Is it to be believed that a man
who intended to beget children, and had no intention of continence,
abstained from sexual intercourse a hundred years and
more, or even, according to the Hebrew version, only a little
less, say eighty, seventy, or sixty years; or, if he did not
abstain, was unable to beget offspring? This question admits
of two solutions. For either puberty was so much later as the
whole life was longer, or, which seems to me more likely, it
is not the first-born sons that are here mentioned, but those
whose names were required to fill up the series until Noah
was reached, from whom again we see that the succession is
continued to Abraham, and after him down to that point of
time until which it was needful to mark by pedigree the
course of the most glorious city, which sojourns as a stranger
in this world, and seeks the heavenly country. That which
is undeniable is that Cain was the first who was born of man
and woman. For had he not been the first who was added
by birth to the two unborn persons, Adam could not have said
what he is recorded to have said, "I have gotten a man by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He was followed by Abel, whom the elder
brother slew, and who was the first to show, by a kind of
foreshadowing of the sojourning city of God, what iniquitous
persecutions that city would suffer at the hands of wicked
and, as it were, earth-born men, who love their earthly origin,
and delight in the earthly happiness of the earthly city. But
how old Adam was when he begat these sons does not appear.
After this the generations diverge, the one branch deriving
from Cain, the other from him whom Adam begot in the room
of Abel slain by his brother, and whom he called Seth, saying,
as it is written, "For God hath raised me up another seed for
Abel whom Cain slew."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> These two series of generations
accordingly, the one of Cain, the other of Seth, represent the
two cities in their distinctive ranks, the one the heavenly city,
which sojourns on earth, the other the earthly, which gapes
after earthly joys, and grovels in them as if they were the
only joys. But though eight generations, including Adam, are
registered before the flood, no man of Cain's line has his age
recorded at which the son who succeeded him was begotten.
For the Spirit of God refused to mark the times before the
flood in the generations of the earthly city, but preferred to do
so in the heavenly line, as if it were more worthy of being
remembered. Further, when Seth was born, the age of his
father is mentioned; but already he had begotten other sons,
and who will presume to say that Cain and Abel were the
only ones previously begotten? For it does not follow that
they alone had been begotten of Adam, because they alone
were named in order to continue the series of generations
which it was desirable to mention. For though the names of
all the rest are buried in silence, yet it is said that Adam
begot sons and daughters; and who that cares to be free from
the charge of temerity will dare to say how many his offspring
numbered? It was possible enough that Adam was divinely
prompted to say, after Seth was born, "For God hath raised
up to me another seed for Abel," because that son was to be
capable of representing Abel's holiness, not because he was born
first after him in point of time. Then because it is written,
"And Seth lived 205 years," or, according to the Hebrew reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"105 years, and begat Enos,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> who but a rash man could
affirm that this was his first-born? Will any man do so to
excite our wonder, and cause us to inquire how for so many
years he remained free from sexual intercourse, though without
any purpose of continuing so, or how, if he did not abstain, he
yet had no children? Will any man do so when it is written
of him, "And he begat sons and daughters, and all the days
of Seth were 912 years, and he died?"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> And similarly regarding
those whose years are afterwards mentioned, it is not
disguised that they begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>Consequently it does not at all appear whether he who is
named as the son was himself the first begotten. Nay, since
it is incredible that those fathers were either so long in attaining
puberty, or could not get wives, or could not impregnate
them, it is also incredible that those sons were their first-born.
But as the writer of the sacred history designed to descend by
well-marked intervals through a series of generations to the
birth and life of Noah, in whose time the flood occurred, he
mentioned not those sons who were first begotten, but those
by whom the succession was handed down.</p>

<p>Let me make this clearer by here inserting an example, in
regard to which no one can have any doubt that what I am
asserting is true. The evangelist Matthew, where he designs
to commit to our memories the generation of the Lord's flesh
by a series of parents, beginning from Abraham and intending
to reach David, says, "Abraham begat Isaac;"<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> why did he
not say Ishmael, whom he first begat? Then "Isaac begat
Jacob;" why did he not say Esau, who was the first-born?
Simply because these sons would not have helped him to
reach David. Then follows, "And Jacob begat Judah and
his brethren:" was Judah the first begotten? "Judah," he
says, "begat Pharez and Zara;" yet neither were these twins
the first-born of Judah, but before them he had begotten
three other sons. And so in the order of the generations he
retained those by whom he might reach David, so as to proceed
onwards to the end he had in view. And from this we
may understand that the antediluvians who are mentioned
were not the first-born, but those through whom the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the succeeding generations might be carried on to the patriarch
Noah. We need not, therefore, weary ourselves with discussing
the needless and obscure question as to their lateness of reaching
puberty.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of marriage between blood-relations, in regard to which the present law
could not bind the men of the earliest ages.</i></p>

<p>As, therefore, the human race, subsequently to the first
marriage of the man who was made of dust, and his wife who
was made out of his side, required the union of males and
females in order that it might multiply, and as there were no
human beings except those who had been born of these two,
men took their sisters for wives,&mdash;an act which was as certainly
dictated by necessity in these ancient days as afterwards it
was condemned by the prohibitions of religion. For it is
very reasonable and just that men, among whom concord is
honourable and useful, should be bound together by various
relationships; and that one man should not himself sustain
many relationships, but that the various relationships should
be distributed among several, and should thus serve to bind
together the greatest number in the same social interests.
"Father" and "father-in-law" are the names of two relationships.
When, therefore, a man has one person for his
father, another for his father-in-law, friendship extends itself
to a larger number. But Adam in his single person was
obliged to hold both relations to his sons and daughters, for
brothers and sisters were united in marriage. So too Eve
his wife was both mother and mother-in-law to her children
of both sexes; while, had there been two women, one the
mother, the other the mother-in-law, the family affection
would have had a wider field. Then the sister herself by
becoming a wife sustained in her single person two relationships,
which, had they been distributed among individuals, one
being sister, and another being wife, the family tie would have
embraced a greater number of persons. But there was then
no material for effecting this, since there were no human
beings but the brothers and sisters born of those two first
parents. Therefore, when an abundant population made it
possible, men ought to choose for wives women who were not
already their sisters; for not only would there then be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
necessity for marrying sisters, but, were it done, it would be
most abominable. For if the grandchildren of the first pair,
being now able to choose their cousins for wives, married
their sisters, then it would no longer be only two but three
relationships that were held by one man, while each of these
relationships ought to have been held by a separate individual,
so as to bind together by family affection a larger number.
For one man would in that case be both father, and father-in-law,
and uncle<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> to his own children (brother and sister now
man and wife); and his wife would be mother, aunt, and
mother-in-law to them; and they themselves would be not
only brother and sister, and man and wife, but cousins also,
being the children of brother and sister. Now, all these
relationships, which combined three men into one, would have
embraced nine persons had each relationship been held by
one individual, so that a man had one person for his sister,
another his wife, another his cousin, another his father, another
his uncle, another his father-in-law, another his mother, another
his aunt, another his mother-in-law; and thus the social bond
would not have been tightened to bind a few, but loosened to
embrace a larger number of relations.</p>

<p>And we see that, since the human race has increased and
multiplied, this is so strictly observed even among the profane
worshippers of many and false gods, that though their
laws perversely allow a brother to marry his sister,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> yet custom,
with a finer morality, prefers to forego this licence; and
though it was quite allowable in the earliest ages of the
human race to marry one's sister, it is now abhorred as a
thing which no circumstances could justify. For custom has
very great power either to attract or to shock human feeling.
And in this matter, while it restrains concupiscence within
due bounds, the man who neglects and disobeys it is justly
branded as abominable. For if it is iniquitous to plough
beyond our own boundaries through the greed of gain, is it
not much more iniquitous to transgress the recognised boundaries
of morals through sexual lust? And with regard to
marriage in the next degree of consanguinity, marriage between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
cousins, we have observed that in our own time the
customary morality has prevented this from being frequent,
though the law allows it. It was not prohibited by divine
law, nor as yet had human law prohibited it; nevertheless,
though legitimate, people shrank from it, because it lay so
close to what was illegitimate, and in marrying a cousin
seemed almost to marry a sister,&mdash;for cousins are so closely
related that they are called brothers and sisters,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and are
almost really so. But the ancient fathers, fearing that near
relationship might gradually in the course of generations
diverge, and become distant relationship, or cease to be relationship
at all, religiously endeavoured to limit it by the
bond of marriage before it became distant, and thus, as it
were, to call it back when it was escaping them. And on
this account, even when the world was full of people, though
they did not choose wives from among their sisters or half-sisters,
yet they preferred them to be of the same stock as
themselves. But who doubts that the modern prohibition of
the marriage even of cousins is the more seemly regulation,&mdash;not
merely on account of the reason we have been urging,
the multiplying of relationships, so that one person might not
absorb two, which might be distributed to two persons, and
so increase the number of people bound together as a family,
but also because there is in human nature I know not what
natural and praiseworthy shamefacedness which restrains us
from desiring that connection which, though for propagation,
is yet lustful, and which even conjugal modesty blushes over,
with any one to whom consanguinity bids us render respect?</p>

<p>The sexual intercourse of man and woman, then, is in the
case of mortals a kind of seed-bed of the city; but while
the earthly city needs for its population only generation, the
heavenly needs also regeneration to rid it of the taint of
generation. Whether before the deluge there was any bodily
or visible sign of regeneration, such as was afterwards enjoined
upon Abraham when he was circumcised, or what kind of
sign it was, the sacred history does not inform us. But it
does inform us that even these earliest of mankind sacrificed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to God, as appeared also in the case of the two first brothers;
Noah, too, is said to have offered sacrifices to God when he
had come forth from the ark after the deluge. And concerning
this subject we have already said in the foregoing books
that the devils arrogate to themselves divinity, and require
sacrifice that they may be esteemed gods, and delight in these
honours on no other account than this, because they know
that true sacrifice is due to the true God.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the two fathers and leaders who sprang from one progenitor.</i></p>

<p>Since, then, Adam was the father of both lines,&mdash;the father,
that is to say, both of the line which belonged to the earthly,
and of that which belonged to the heavenly city,&mdash;when Abel
was slain, and by his death exhibited a marvellous mystery,
there were henceforth two lines proceeding from two fathers,
Cain and Seth, and in those sons of theirs, whom it behoved
to register, the tokens of these two cities began to appear
more distinctly. For Cain begat Enoch, in whose name he
built a city, an earthly one, which was not from home in this
world, but rested satisfied with its temporal peace and happiness.
Cain, too, means "possession;" wherefore at his birth
either his father or mother said, "I have gotten a man through
God." Then Enoch means "dedication;" for the earthly city
is dedicated in this world in which it is built, for in this
world it finds the end towards which it aims and aspires.
Further, Seth signifies "resurrection," and Enos his son signifies
"man," not as Adam, which also signifies man but is
used in Hebrew indifferently for man and woman, as it is
written, "Male and female created He them, and blessed them,
and called their name Adam,"<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> leaving no room to doubt that
though the woman was distinctively called Eve, yet the name
Adam, meaning man, was common to both. But Enos means
man in so restricted a sense, that Hebrew linguists tell us it
cannot be applied to woman: it is the equivalent of the
"child of the resurrection," when they neither marry nor are
given in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> For there shall be no generation in that
place to which regeneration shall have brought us. Wherefore
I think it not immaterial to observe that in those generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
which are propagated from him who is called Seth,
although daughters as well as sons are said to have been
begotten, no woman is expressly registered by name; but in
those which sprang from Cain at the very termination to
which the line runs, the last person named as begotten is a
woman. For we read, "Methusael begat Lamech. And
Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. And Adah bare
Jabal: he was the father of the shepherds that dwell in tents.
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
such as handle the harp and organ. And Zillah, she also
bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and
iron: and the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Here terminate
all the generations of Cain, being eight in number,
including Adam,&mdash;to wit, seven from Adam to Lamech, who
married two wives, and whose children, among whom a woman
also is named, form the eighth generation. Whereby it is
elegantly signified that the earthly city shall to its termination
have carnal generations proceeding from the intercourse
of males and females. And therefore the wives themselves
of the man who is the last named father of Cain's line are
registered in their own names,&mdash;a practice nowhere followed
before the deluge save in Eve's case. Now as Cain, signifying
possession, the founder of the earthly city, and his son
Enoch, meaning dedication, in whose name it was founded,
indicate that this city is earthly both in its beginning and in
its end,&mdash;a city in which nothing more is hoped for than can
be seen in this world,&mdash;so Seth, meaning resurrection, and
being the father of generations registered apart from the
others, we must consider what this sacred history says of
his son.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>The significance of Abel, Seth, and Enos to Christ and His body
the Church.</i></p>

<p>"And to Seth," it is said, "there was born a son, and he
called his name Enos: he hoped to call on the name of the
Lord God."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Here we have a loud testimony to the truth.
Man, then, the son of the resurrection, lives in hope: he
lives in hope as long as the city of God, which is begotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
by faith in the resurrection, sojourns in this world. For in
these two men, Abel, signifying "grief," and his brother Seth,
signifying "resurrection," the death of Christ and His life from
the dead are prefigured. And by faith in these is begotten
in this world the city of God, that is to say, the man who has
hoped to call on the name of the Lord. "For by hope," says
the apostle, "we are saved: but hope that is seen is not
hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Who can avoid referring this to a
profound mystery? For did not Abel hope to call upon the
name of the Lord God when his sacrifice is mentioned in
Scripture as having been accepted by God? Did not Seth
himself hope to call on the name of the Lord God, of whom
it was said, "For God hath appointed me another seed instead
of Abel?" Why then is this which is found to be
common to all the godly specially attributed to Enos, unless
because it was fit that in him, who is mentioned as the
first-born of the father of those generations which were separated
to the better part of the heavenly city, there should be
a type of the man, or society of men, who live not according
to man in contentment with earthly felicity, but according to
God in hope of everlasting felicity? And it was not said, "He
hoped in the Lord God," nor "He called on the name of the
Lord God," but "He hoped to call on the name of the Lord
God." And what does this "hoped to call" mean, unless it
is a prophecy that a people should arise who, according to the
election of grace, would call on the name of the Lord God?
It is this which has been said by another prophet, and which
the apostle interprets of the people who belong to the grace
of God: "And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> For these two expressions,
"And he called his name Enos, which means man," and
"He hoped to call on the name of the Lord God," are sufficient
proof that man ought not to rest his hopes in himself;
as it is elsewhere written, "Cursed is the man that trusteth
in man."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Consequently no one ought to trust in himself
that he shall become a citizen of that other city which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
dedicated in the name of Cain's son in this present time, that
is to say, in the fleeting course of this mortal world, but in
the immortality of perpetual blessedness.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>The significance of Enoch's translation.</i></p>

<p>For that line also of which Seth is the father has the
name "Dedication" in the seventh generation from Adam,
counting Adam. For the seventh from him is Enoch, that
is, Dedication. But this is that man who was translated
because he pleased God, and who held in the order of the
generations a remarkable place, being the seventh from Adam,
a number signalized by the consecration of the Sabbath. But,
counting from the diverging point of the two lines, or from
Seth, he was the sixth. Now it was on the sixth day God
made man, and consummated His works. But the translation
of Enoch prefigured our deferred dedication; for though
it is indeed already accomplished in Christ our Head, who
so rose again that He shall die no more, and who was Himself
also translated, yet there remains another dedication of
the whole house, of which Christ Himself is the foundation,
and this dedication is deferred till the end, when all shall
rise again to die no more. And whether it is the house of
God, or the temple of God, or the city of God, that is said to
be dedicated, it is all the same, and equally in accordance with
the usage of the Latin language. For Virgil himself calls the
city of widest empire "the house of Assaracus,"<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> meaning the
Romans, who were descended through the Trojans from Assaracus.
He also calls them the house of Æneas, because
Rome was built by those Trojans who had come to Italy
under Æneas.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> For that poet imitated the sacred writings,
in which the Hebrew nation, though so numerous, is called
the house of Jacob.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>20. <i>How it is that Cain's line terminates in the eighth generation, while Noah,
though descended from the same father, Adam, is found to be the tenth
from him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some one will say, If the writer of this history intended,
in enumerating the generations from Adam through his son
Seth, to descend through them to Noah, in whose time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
deluge occurred, and from him again to trace the connected
generations down to Abraham, with whom Matthew begins
the pedigree of Christ the eternal King of the city of God,
what did he intend by enumerating the generations from Cain,
and to what terminus did he mean to trace them? We
reply, To the deluge, by which the whole stock of the earthly
city was destroyed, but repaired by the sons of Noah. For
the earthly city and community of men who live after the
flesh will never fail until the end of this world, of which our
Lord says, "The children of this world generate, and are generated."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
But the city of God, which sojourns in this world,
is conducted by regeneration to the world to come, of which
the children neither generate nor are generated. In this
world generation is common to both cities; though even now
the city of God has many thousand citizens who abstain from
the act of generation; yet the other city also has some citizens
who imitate these, though erroneously. For to that city belong
also those who have erred from the faith, and introduced
divers heresies; for they live according to man, not according
to God. And the Indian gymnosophists, who are said to
philosophize in the solitudes of India in a state of nudity, are
its citizens; and they abstain from marriage. For continence
is not a good thing, except when it is practised in the faith of
the highest good, that is, God. Yet no one is found to have
practised it before the deluge; for indeed even Enoch himself,
the seventh from Adam, who is said to have been translated
without dying, begat sons and daughters before he was translated,
and among these was Methuselah, by whom the succession
of the recorded generations is maintained.</p>

<p>Why, then, is so small a number of Cain's generations
registered, if it was proper to trace them to the deluge, and
if there was no such delay of the date of puberty as to preclude
the hope of offspring for a hundred or more years? For
if the author of this book had not in view some one to whom
he might rigidly trace the series of generations, as he designed
in those which sprang from Seth's seed to descend to Noah,
and thence to start again by a rigid order, what need was
there of omitting the first-born sons for the sake of descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to Lamech, in whose sons that line terminates,&mdash;that is
to say, in the eighth generation from Adam, or the seventh
from Cain,&mdash;as if from this point he had wished to pass on to
another series, by which he might reach either the Israelitish
people, among whom the earthly Jerusalem presented a prophetic
figure of the heavenly city, or to Jesus Christ, "according
to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever,"<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> the
Maker and Ruler of the heavenly city? What, I say, was the
need of this, seeing that the whole of Cain's posterity were
destroyed in the deluge? From this it is manifest that they
are the first-born sons who are registered in this genealogy.
Why, then, are there so few of them? Their numbers in the
period before the deluge must have been greater, if the date
of puberty bore no proportion to their longevity, and they had
children before they were a hundred years old. For supposing
they were on an average thirty years old when they began to
beget children, then, as there are eight generations, including
Adam and Lamech's children, 8 times 30 gives 240 years;
did they then produce no more children in all the rest of the
time before the deluge? With what intention, then, did he
who wrote this record make no mention of subsequent generations?
For from Adam to the deluge there are reckoned,
according to our copies of Scripture, 2262 years,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and according
to the Hebrew text, 1656 years. Supposing, then, the
smaller number to be the true one, and subtracting from
1656 years 240, is it credible that during the remaining
1400 and odd years until the deluge the posterity of Cain
begat no children?</p>

<p>But let any one who is moved by this call to mind that
when I discussed the question, how it is credible that those
primitive men could abstain for so many years from begetting
children, two modes of solution were found,&mdash;either a puberty
late in proportion to their longevity, or that the sons registered
in the genealogies were not the first-born, but those through
whom the author of the book intended to reach the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
aimed at, as he intended to reach Noah by the generations of
Seth. So that, if in the generations of Cain there occurs no
one whom the writer could make it his object to reach by
omitting the first-borns and inserting those who would serve
such a purpose, then we must have recourse to the supposition
of late puberty, and say that only at some age beyond a
hundred years they became capable of begetting children, so
that the order of the generations ran through the first-borns,
and filled up even the whole period before the deluge, long
though it was. It is, however, possible that, for some more
secret reason which escapes me, this city, which we say is
earthly, is exhibited in all its generations down to Lamech
and his sons, and that then the writer withholds from recording
the rest which may have existed before the deluge. And
without supposing so late a puberty in these men, there might
be another reason for tracing the generations by sons who were
not first-borns, viz. that the same city which Cain built, and
named after his son Enoch, may have had a widely extended
dominion and many kings, not reigning simultaneously, but
successively, the reigning king begetting always his successor.
Cain himself would be the first of these kings; his son
Enoch, in whose name the city in which he reigned was built,
would be the second; the third Irad, whom Enoch begat;
the fourth Mehujael, whom Irad begat; the fifth Methusael,
whom Mehujael begat; the sixth Lamech, whom Methusael
begat, and who is the seventh from Adam through Cain.
But it was not necessary that the first-born should succeed
their fathers in the kingdom, but those would succeed who
were recommended by the possession of some virtue useful to
the earthly city, or who were chosen by lot, or the son who
was best liked by his father would succeed by a kind of
hereditary right to the throne. And the deluge may have
happened during the lifetime and reign of Lamech, and may
have destroyed him along with all other men, save those who
were in the ark. For we cannot be surprised that, during so
long a period from Adam to the deluge, and with the ages of
individuals varying as they did, there should not be an equal
number of generations in both lines, but seven in Cain's, and
ten in Seth's; for as I have already said, Lamech is the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
from Adam, Noah the tenth; and in Lamech's case not one
son only is registered, as in the former instances, but more,
because it was uncertain which of them would have succeeded
when he died, if there had intervened any time to reign
between his death and the deluge.</p>

<p>But in whatever manner the generations of Cain's line are
traced downwards, whether it be by first-born sons or by the
heirs to the throne, it seems to me that I must by no means
omit to notice that, when Lamech had been set down as the
seventh from Adam, there were named, in addition, as many
of his children as made up this number to eleven, which is
the number signifying sin; for three sons and one daughter
are added. The wives of Lamech have another signification,
different from that which I am now pressing. For at present
I am speaking of the children, and not of those by whom the
children were begotten. Since, then, the law is symbolized
by the number ten,&mdash;whence that memorable Decalogue,&mdash;there
is no doubt that the number eleven, which goes beyond<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
ten, symbolizes the transgression of the law, and consequently
sin. For this reason, eleven veils of goat's skin were ordered
to be hung in the tabernacle of the testimony, which served
in the wanderings of God's people as an ambulatory temple.
And in that haircloth there was a reminder of sins, because
the goats were to be set on the left hand of the Judge; and
therefore, when we confess our sins, we prostrate ourselves in
haircloth, as if we were saying what is written in the psalm,
"My sin is ever before me."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The progeny of Adam, then,
by Cain the murderer, is completed in the number eleven,
which symbolizes sin; and this number itself is made up by
a woman, as it was by the same sex that beginning was made
of sin by which we all die. And it was committed that the
pleasure of the flesh, which resists the spirit, might follow;
and so Naamah, the daughter of Lamech, means "pleasure."
But from Adam to Noah, in the line of Seth, there are ten
generations. And to Noah three sons are added, of whom,
while one fell into sin, two were blessed by their father; so
that, if you deduct the reprobate and add the gracious sons to
the number, you get twelve,&mdash;a number signalized in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of the patriarchs and of the apostles, and made up of the parts
of the number seven multiplied into one another,&mdash;for three
times four, or four times three, give twelve. These things
being so, I see that I must consider and mention how these
two lines, which by their separate genealogies depict the two
cities, one of earth-born, the other of regenerated persons,
became afterwards so mixed and confused, that the whole
human race, with the exception of eight persons, deserved to
perish in the deluge.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>21. <i>Why it is that, as soon as Cain's son Enoch has been named, the genealogy
is forthwith continued as far as the deluge, while after the mention of
Enos, Seth's son, the narrative returns again to the creation of man.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We must first see why, in the enumeration of Cain's posterity,
after Enoch, in whose name the city was built, has
been first of all mentioned, the rest are at once enumerated
down to that terminus of which I have spoken, and at which
that race and the whole line was destroyed in the deluge;
while, after Enos the son of Seth has been mentioned, the
rest are not at once named down to the deluge, but a clause
is inserted to the following effect: "This is the book of the
generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in
the likeness of God made He him; male and female created
He them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in
the day when they were created."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> This seems to me to be
inserted for this purpose, that here again the reckoning of the
times may start from Adam himself,&mdash;a purpose which the
writer had not in view in speaking of the earthly city, as if
God mentioned it, but did not take account of its duration.
But why does he return to this recapitulation after mentioning
the son of Seth, the man who hoped to call on the name
of the Lord God, unless because it was fit thus to present
these two cities, the one beginning with a murderer and
ending in a murderer (for Lamech, too, acknowledges to his
two wives that he had committed murder), the other built
up by him who hoped to call upon the name of the Lord
God? For the highest and complete terrestrial duty of the
city of God, which is a stranger in this world, is that which
was exemplified in the individual who was begotten by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
who typified the resurrection of the murdered Abel. That
one man is the unity of the whole heavenly city, not yet
indeed complete, but to be completed, as this prophetic figure
foreshows. The son of Cain, therefore, that is, the son of
possession (and of what but an earthly possession?), may have
a name in the earthly city which was built in his name. It
is of such the Psalmist says, "They call their lands after their
own names."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Wherefore they incur what is written in another
psalm: "Thou, O Lord, in Thy city wilt despise their image."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
But as for the son of Seth, the son of the resurrection, let him
hope to call on the name of the Lord God. For he prefigures
that society of men which says, "But I am like a green olive-tree
in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of
God."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> But let him not seek the empty honours of a famous
name upon earth, for "Blessed is the man that maketh the
name of the Lord his trust, and respecteth not vanities nor
lying follies."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> After having presented the two cities, the one
founded in the material good of this world, the other in hope
in God, but both starting from a common gate opened in Adam
into this mortal state, and both running on and running out
to their proper and merited ends, Scripture begins to reckon
the times, and in this reckoning includes other generations,
making a recapitulation from Adam, out of whose condemned
seed, as out of one mass handed over to merited damnation,
God made some vessels of wrath to dishonour and others
vessels of mercy to honour; in punishment rendering to the
former what is due, in grace giving to the latter what is not
due: in order that by the very comparison of itself with the
vessels of wrath, the heavenly city, which sojourns on earth,
may learn not to put confidence in the liberty of its own will,
but may hope to call on the name of the Lord God. For will,
being a nature which was made good by the good God, but
mutable by the immutable, because it was made out of nothing,
can both decline from good to do evil, which takes place when
it freely chooses, and can also escape the evil and do good,
which takes place only by divine assistance.</p>

<p>22. <i>Of the fall of the sons of God who were captivated by the daughters of men,
whereby all, with the exception of eight persons, deservedly perished in
the deluge.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When the human race, in the exercise of this freedom of
will, increased and advanced, there arose a mixture and confusion
of the two cities by their participation in a common
iniquity. And this calamity, as well as the first, was occasioned
by woman, though not in the same way; for these
women were not themselves betrayed, neither did they persuade
the men to sin, but having belonged to the earthly city
and society of the earthly, they had been of corrupt manners
from the first, and were loved for their bodily beauty by the
sons of God, or the citizens of the other city which sojourns
in this world. Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but
that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it
even to the wicked. And thus, when the good that is great
and proper to the good was abandoned by the sons of God,
they fell to a paltry good which is not peculiar to the good,
but common to the good and the evil; and when they were
captivated by the daughters of men, they adopted the manners
of the earthly to win them as their brides, and forsook the
godly ways they had followed in their own holy society. And
thus beauty, which is indeed God's handiwork, but only a
temporal, carnal, and lower kind of good, is not fitly loved in
preference to God, the eternal, spiritual, and unchangeable
good. When the miser prefers his gold to justice, it is through
no fault of the gold, but of the man; and so with every
created thing. For though it be good, it may be loved with
an evil as well as with a good love: it is loved rightly when
it is loved ordinately; evilly, when inordinately. It is this
which some one has briefly said in these verses in praise of
the Creator:<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> "These are Thine, they are good, because Thou
art good who didst create them. There is in them nothing
of ours, unless the sin we commit when we forget the order
of things, and instead of Thee love that which Thou hast
made."</p>

<p>But if the Creator is truly loved, that is, if He Himself is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
loved and not another thing in His stead, He cannot be
evilly loved; for love itself is to be ordinately loved, because
we do well to love that which, when we love it, makes us live
well and virtuously. So that it seems to me that it is a brief
but true definition of virtue to say, it is the order of love;
and on this account, in the Canticles, the bride of Christ, the
city of God, sings, "Order love within me."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> It was the
order of this love, then, this charity or attachment, which the
sons of God disturbed when they forsook God, and were enamoured
of the daughters of men.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> And by these two names
(sons of God and daughters of men) the two cities are sufficiently
distinguished. For though the former were by nature
children of men, they had come into possession of another
name by grace. For in the same Scripture in which the sons
of God are said to have loved the daughters of men, they are
also called angels of God; whence many suppose that they
were not men but angels.</p>

<p>23. <i>Whether we are to believe that angels, who are of a spiritual substance, fell in
love with the beauty of women, and sought them in marriage, and that
from this connection giants were born.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In the third book of this work (c. 5) we made a passing
reference to this question, but did not decide whether angels,
inasmuch as they are spirits, could have bodily intercourse with
women. For it is written, "Who maketh His angels spirits,"<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
that is, He makes those who are by nature spirits His angels
by appointing them to the duty of bearing His messages.
For the Greek word &#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;, which in Latin appears as
"angelus," means a messenger. But whether the Psalmist
speaks of their bodies when he adds, "and His ministers a
flaming fire," or means that God's ministers ought to blaze
with love as with a spiritual fire, is doubtful. However, the
same trustworthy Scripture testifies that angels have appeared
to men in such bodies as could not only be seen, but also
touched. There is, too, a very general rumour, which many
have verified by their own experience, or which trustworthy
persons who have heard the experience of others corroborate,
that sylvans and fauns, who are commonly called "incubi,"
had often made wicked assaults upon women, and satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
their lust upon them; and that certain devils, called Duses
by the Gauls, are constantly attempting and effecting this impurity
is so generally affirmed, that it were impudent to deny
it.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> From these assertions, indeed, I dare not determine
whether there be some spirits embodied in an aerial substance
(for this element, even when agitated by a fan, is sensibly felt
by the body), and who are capable of lust and of mingling
sensibly with women; but certainly I could by no means
believe that God's holy angels could at that time have so
fallen, nor can I think that it is of them the Apostle Peter
said, "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness,
to be reserved unto judgment."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> I think he rather speaks of
those who first apostatized from God, along with their chief
the devil, who enviously deceived the first man under the form
of a serpent. But the same holy Scripture affords the most
ample testimony that even godly men have been called angels;
for of John it is written: "Behold, I send my messenger (angel)
before Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> And the
prophet Malachi, by a peculiar grace specially communicated
to him, was called an angel.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>But some are moved by the fact that we have read that the
fruit of the connection between those who are called angels of
God and the women they loved were not men like our own
breed, but giants; just as if there were not born even in our
own time (as I have mentioned above) men of much greater
size than the ordinary stature. Was there not at Rome a few
years ago, when the destruction of the city now accomplished
by the Goths was drawing near, a woman, with her father and
mother, who by her gigantic size overtopped all others? Surprising
crowds from all quarters came to see her, and that
which struck them most was the circumstance that neither
of her parents were quite up to the tallest ordinary stature.
Giants therefore might well be born, even before the sons of
God, who are also called angels of God, formed a connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
with the daughters of men, or of those living according to men,
that is to say, before the sons of Seth formed a connection
with the daughters of Cain. For thus speaks even the
canonical Scripture itself in the book in which we read of
this; its words are: "And it came to pass, when men began
to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born
unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men
that they were fair [good]; and they took them wives of all
which they chose. And the Lord God said, My Spirit shall
not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his
days shall be an hundred and twenty years. There were
giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when
the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they
bare children to them, the same became the giants, men of
renown."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> These words of the divine book sufficiently indicate
that already there were giants in the earth in those days, in
which the sons of God took wives of the children of men,
when they loved them because they were good, that is, fair.
For it is the custom of this Scripture to call those who are
beautiful in appearance "good." But after this connection
had been formed, then too were giants born. For the words
are: "There were giants in the earth in those days, <i>and also
after that</i>, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters
of men." Therefore there were giants both before, "in those
days," and "also after that." And the words, "they bare
children to them," show plainly enough that before the sons
of God fell in this fashion they begat children to God, not to
themselves,&mdash;that is to say, not moved by the lust of sexual
intercourse, but discharging the duty of propagation, intending
to produce not a family to gratify their own pride, but citizens
to people the city of God; and to these they as God's angels
would bear the message, that they should place their hope in
God, like him who was born of Seth the son of resurrection,
and who hoped to call on the name of the Lord God, in which
hope they and their offspring would be co-heirs of eternal blessings,
and brethren in the family of which God is the Father.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>But that those angels were not angels in the sense of not
being men, as some suppose, Scripture itself decides, which
unambiguously declares that they were men. For when it had
first been stated that "the angels of God saw the daughters of
men that they were fair, and they took them wives of all
which they chose," it was immediately added, "And the Lord
God said, My Spirit shall not always strive with these men, for
that they also are flesh." For by the Spirit of God they had
been made angels of God, and sons of God; but declining
towards lower things, they are called men, a name of nature,
not of grace; and they are called flesh, as deserters of the
Spirit, and by their desertion deserted [by Him]. The Septuagint
indeed calls them both angels of God and sons of
God, though all the copies do not show this, some having
only the name "sons of God." And Aquila, whom the Jews
prefer to the other interpreters,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> has translated neither angels
of God nor sons of God, but sons of gods. But both are
correct. For they were both sons of God, and thus brothers
of their own fathers, who were children of the same God; and
they were sons of gods, because begotten by gods, together
with whom they themselves also were gods, according to that
expression of the psalm: "I have said, Ye are gods, and all of
you are children of the Most High."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> For the Septuagint
translators are justly believed to have received the Spirit of
prophecy; so that, if they made any alterations under His
authority, and did not adhere to a strict translation, we could
not doubt that this was divinely dictated. However, the
Hebrew word may be said to be ambiguous, and to be susceptible
of either translation, "sons of God," or "sons of
gods."</p>

<p>Let us omit, then, the fables of those scriptures which are
called apocryphal, because their obscure origin was unknown
to the fathers from whom the authority of the true Scriptures
has been transmitted to us by a most certain and well-ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
succession. For though there is some truth in these
apocryphal writings, yet they contain so many false statements,
that they have no canonical authority. We cannot
deny that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, left some divine
writings, for this is asserted by the Apostle Jude in his canonical
epistle. But it is not without reason that these writings
have no place in that canon of Scripture which was preserved
in the temple of the Hebrew people by the diligence of successive
priests; for their antiquity brought them under suspicion,
and it was impossible to ascertain whether these were
his genuine writings, and they were not brought forward as
genuine by the persons who were found to have carefully preserved
the canonical books by a successive transmission. So
that the writings which are produced under his name, and
which contain these fables about the giants, saying that their
fathers were not men, are properly judged by prudent men to
be not genuine; just as many writings are produced by
heretics under the names both of other prophets, and, more
recently, under the names of the apostles, all of which, after
careful examination, have been set apart from canonical authority
under the title of Apocrypha. There is therefore no
doubt that, according to the Hebrew and Christian canonical
Scriptures, there were many giants before the deluge, and that
these were citizens of the earthly society of men, and that the
sons of God, who were according to the flesh the sons of Seth,
sunk into this community when they forsook righteousness.
Nor need we wonder that giants should be born even from
these. For all of their children were not giants; but there
were more then than in the remaining periods since the
deluge. And it pleased the Creator to produce them, that it
might thus be demonstrated that neither beauty, nor yet size
and strength, are of much moment to the wise man, whose
blessedness lies in spiritual and immortal blessings, in far better
and more enduring gifts, in the good things that are the peculiar
property of the good, and are not shared by good and bad
alike. It is this which another prophet confirms when he
says, "These were the giants, famous from the beginning,
that were of so great stature, and so expert in war. Those
did not the Lord choose, neither gave He the way of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
unto them; but they were destroyed because they had
no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>


<p class="center">24. <i>How we are to understand this which the Lord said to those who were
to perish in the flood: "Their days shall be</i> 120 <i>years."</i></p>

<p>But that which God said, "Their days shall be an hundred
and twenty years," is not to be understood as a prediction that
henceforth men should not live longer than 120 years,&mdash;for
even after the deluge we find that they lived more than 500
years,&mdash;but we are to understand that God said this when Noah
had nearly completed his fifth century, that is, had lived 480
years, which Scripture, as it frequently uses the name of the
whole for the largest part, calls 500 years. Now the deluge
came in the 600th year of Noah's life, the second month; and
thus 120 years were predicted as being the remaining span of
those who were doomed, which years being spent, they should
be destroyed by the deluge. And it is not unreasonably
believed that the deluge came as it did, because already there
were not found upon earth any who were not worthy of
sharing a death so manifestly judicial,&mdash;not that a good man,
who must die some time, would be a jot the worse of such a
death after it was past. Nevertheless there died in the deluge
none of those mentioned in the sacred Scripture as descended
from Seth. But here is the divine account of the cause of the
deluge: "The Lord God saw that the wickedness of man was
great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the
Lord that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him
at His heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man, whom I
have created, from the face of the earth; both man and beast,
and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air: for I am
angry that I have made them."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of the anger of God, which does not inflame His mind, nor disturb His
unchangeable tranquillity.</i></p>

<p>The anger of God is not a disturbing emotion of His mind,
but a judgment by which punishment is inflicted upon sin.
His thought and reconsideration also are the unchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
reason which changes things; for He does not, like man,
repent of anything He has done, because in all matters His
decision is as inflexible as His prescience is certain. But if
Scripture were not to use such expressions as the above, it
would not familiarly insinuate itself into the minds of all
classes of men, whom it seeks access to for their good, that it
may alarm the proud, arouse the careless, exercise the inquisitive,
and satisfy the intelligent; and this it could not do, did
it not first stoop, and in a manner descend, to them where they
lie. But its denouncing death on all the animals of earth and
air is a declaration of the vastness of the disaster that was
approaching: not that it threatens destruction to the irrational
animals as if they too had incurred it by sin.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That the ark which Noah was ordered to make figures in every respect
Christ and the church.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, inasmuch as God commanded Noah, a just man,
and, as the truthful Scripture says, a man perfect in his generation,&mdash;not
indeed with the perfection of the citizens of the
city of God in that immortal condition in which they equal
the angels, but in so far as they can be perfect in their sojourn
in this world,&mdash;inasmuch as God commanded him, I say, to make
an ark, in which he might be rescued from the destruction of
the flood, along with his family, <i>i.e.</i> his wife, sons, and daughters-in-law,
and along with the animals who, in obedience to God's
command, came to him into the ark: is certainly a figure
of the city of God sojourning in this world; that is to say,
of the church, which is rescued by the wood on which hung
the Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> For
even its very dimensions, in length, breadth, and height, represent
the human body in which He came, as it had been foretold.
For the length of the human body, from the crown of
the head to the sole of the foot, is six times its breadth from
side to side, and ten times its depth or thickness, measuring
from back to front: that is to say, if you measure a man as
he lies on his back or on his face, he is six times as long from
head to foot as he is broad from side to side, and ten times as
long as he is high from the ground. And therefore the ark
was made 300 cubits in length, 50 in breadth, and 30 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
height. And its having a door made in the side of it certainly
signified the wound which was made when the side of
the Crucified was pierced with the spear: for by this those
who come to Him enter; for thence flowed the sacraments by
which those who believe are initiated. And the fact that it
was ordered to be made of squared timbers, signifies the immoveable
steadiness of the life of the saints; for however you
turn a cube, it still stands. And the other peculiarities of
the ark's construction are signs of features of the church.</p>

<p>But we have not now time to pursue this subject; and,
indeed, we have already dwelt upon it in the work we wrote
against Faustus the Manichean, who denies that there is anything
prophesied of Christ in the Hebrew books. It may be
that one man's exposition excels another's, and that ours is
not the best; but all that is said must be referred to this
city of God we speak of, which sojourns in this wicked world
as in a deluge, at least if the expositor would not widely miss
the meaning of the author. For example, the interpretation
I have given in the work against Faustus, of the words, "with
lower, second, and third storeys shalt thou make it," is, that
because the church is gathered out of all nations, it is said to
have two storeys, to represent the two kinds of men,&mdash;the circumcision,
to wit, and the uncircumcision, or, as the apostle
otherwise calls them, Jews and Gentiles; and to have three
storeys, because all the nations were replenished from the
three sons of Noah. Now any one may object to this interpretation,
and may give another which harmonizes with the
rule of faith. For as the ark was to have rooms not only on
the lower, but also on the upper storeys, which were called
"third storeys," that there might be a habitable space on the
third floor from the basement, some one may interpret these
to mean the three graces commended by the apostle,&mdash;faith,
hope, and charity. Or even more suitably they may be supposed
to represent those three harvests in the gospel, thirty-fold,
sixtyfold, an hundredfold,&mdash;chaste marriage dwelling in
the ground floor, chaste widowhood in the upper, and chaste
virginity in the top storey. Or any better interpretation may
be given, so long as the reference to this city is maintained.
And the same statement I would make of all the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
particulars in this passage which require exposition, viz. that
although different explanations are given, yet they must all
agree with the one harmonious catholic faith.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>Of the ark and the deluge, and that we cannot agree with those who receive
the bare history, but reject the allegorical interpretation, nor with those
who maintain the figurative and not the historical meaning.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Yet no one ought to suppose either that these things were
written for no purpose, or that we should study only the
historical truth, apart from any allegorical meanings; or, on
the contrary, that they are only allegories, and that there were
no such facts at all, or that, whether it be so or no, there
is here no prophecy of the church. For what right-minded
man will contend that books so religiously preserved during
thousands of years, and transmitted by so orderly a succession,
were written without an object, or that only the bare
historical facts are to be considered when we read them?
For, not to mention other instances, if the number of the
animals entailed the construction of an ark of great size,
where was the necessity of sending into it two unclean and
seven clean animals of each species, when both could have
been preserved in equal numbers? Or could not God, who
ordered them to be preserved in order to replenish the race,
restore them in the same way He had created them?</p>

<p>But they who contend that these things never happened,
but are only figures setting forth other things, in the first
place suppose that there could not be a flood so great that the
water should rise fifteen cubits above the highest mountains,
because it is said that clouds cannot rise above the top of
Mount Olympus, because it reaches the sky where there is
none of that thicker atmosphere in which winds, clouds, and
rains have their origin. They do not reflect that the densest
element of all, earth, can exist there; or perhaps they deny
that the top of the mountain is earth. Why, then, do these
measurers and weighers of the elements contend that earth
can be raised to those aerial altitudes, and that water cannot,
while they admit that water is lighter, and liker to ascend
than earth? What reason do they adduce why earth, the
heavier and lower element, has for so many ages scaled to the
tranquil æther, while water, the lighter, and more likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
ascend, is not suffered to do the same even for a brief space
of time?</p>

<p>They say, too, that the area of that ark could not contain
so many kinds of animals of both sexes, two of the unclean
and seven of the clean. But they seem to me to reckon only
one area of 300 cubits long and 50 broad, and not to remember
that there was another similar in the storey above, and yet
another as large in the storey above that again; and that there
was consequently an area of 900 cubits by 150. And if we
accept what Origen<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> has with some appropriateness suggested,
that Moses the man of God, being, as it is written, "learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> who delighted in geometry,
may have meant geometrical cubits, of which they say
that one is equal to six of our cubits, then who does not see
what a capacity these dimensions give to the ark? For as to
their objection that an ark of such size could not be built, it
is a very silly calumny; for they are aware that huge cities
have been built, and they should remember that the ark was
an hundred years in building. Or, perhaps, though stone can
adhere to stone when cemented with nothing but lime, so that<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">a wall of several miles may be constructed, yet plank cannot be</span><br />
riveted to plank by mortices, bolts, nails, and pitch-glue, so as
to construct an ark which was not made with curved ribs but
straight timbers, which was not to be launched by its builders
but to be lifted by the natural pressure of the water when it
reached it, and which was to be preserved from shipwreck as
it floated about rather by divine oversight than by human
skill.</p>

<p>As to another customary inquiry of the scrupulous about
the very minute creatures, not only such as mice and lizards,
but also locusts, beetles, flies, fleas, and so forth, whether there
were not in the ark a larger number of them than was determined
by God in His command, those persons who are moved
by this difficulty are to be reminded that the words "every
creeping thing of the earth" only indicate that it was not
needful to preserve in the ark the animals that can live in
the water, whether the fishes that live submerged in it, or the
sea-birds that swim on its surface. Then, when it is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"male and female," no doubt reference is made to the repairing
of the races, and consequently there was no need for
those creatures being in the ark which are born without the
union of the sexes from inanimate things, or from their corruption;
or if they were in the ark, they might be there as they
commonly are in houses, not in any determinate numbers;
or if it was necessary that there should be a definite number
of all those animals that cannot naturally live in the water,
that so the most sacred mystery which was being enacted
might be bodied forth and perfectly figured in actual realities,
still this was not the care of Noah or his sons, but of God.
For Noah did not catch the animals and put them into the
ark, but gave them entrance as they came seeking it. For
this is the force of the words, "They shall come unto thee,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;not,
that is to say, by man's effort, but by God's will. But
certainly we are not required to believe that those which
have no sex also came; for it is expressly and definitely said,
"They shall be male and female."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> For there are some
animals which are born out of corruption, but yet afterwards
they themselves copulate and produce offspring, as flies; but
others, which have no sex, like bees. Then, as to those animals
which have sex, but without ability to propagate their kind,
like mules and she-mules, it is probable that they were not in
the ark, but that it was counted sufficient to preserve their
parents, to wit, the horse and the ass; and this applies to all
hybrids. Yet, if it was necessary for the completeness of the
mystery, they were there; for even this species has "male
and female."</p>

<p>Another question is commonly raised regarding the food of
the carnivorous animals,&mdash;whether, without transgressing the
command which fixed the number to be preserved, there were
necessarily others included in the ark for their sustenance;
or, as is more probable, there might be some food which was
not flesh, and which yet suited all. For we know how many
animals whose food is flesh eat also vegetable products and
fruits, especially figs and chestnuts. What wonder is it,
therefore, if that wise and just man was instructed by God
what would suit each, so that without flesh he prepared and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
stored provision fit for every species? And what is there
which hunger would not make animals eat? Or what could
not be made sweet and wholesome by God, who, with a
divine facility, might have enabled them to do without food
at all, had it not been requisite to the completeness of so
great a mystery that they should be fed? But none but a
contentious man can suppose that there was no prefiguring of
the church in so manifold and circumstantial a detail. For
the nations have already so filled the church, and are comprehended
in the framework of its unity, the clean and unclean
together, until the appointed end, that this one very
manifest fulfilment leaves no doubt how we should interpret
even those others which are somewhat more obscure, and
which cannot so readily be discerned. And since this is so,
if not even the most audacious will presume to assert that
these things were written without a purpose, or that though the
events really happened they mean nothing, or that they did not
really happen, but are only allegory, or that at all events they
are far from having any figurative reference to the church;
if it has been made out that, on the other hand, we must
rather believe that there was a wise purpose in their being
committed to memory and to writing, and that they did
happen, and have a significance, and that this significance has
a prophetic reference to the church, then this book, having
served this purpose, may now be closed, that we may go on
to trace in the history subsequent to the deluge the courses
of the two cities,&mdash;the earthly, that lives according to men,
and the heavenly, that lives according to God.</p>

TO THE KINGS OF ISRAEL, IS THE SUBJECT.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Whether, after the deluge, from Noah to Abraham, any families can be
found who lived according to God.</i></p>

<p>It is difficult to discover from Scripture, whether, after the
deluge, traces of the holy city are continuous, or are so
interrupted by intervening seasons of godlessness, that not a
single worshipper of the one true God was found among
men; because from Noah, who, with his wife, three sons, and
as many daughters-in-law, achieved deliverance in the ark
from the destruction of the deluge, down to Abraham, we do
not find in the canonical books that the piety of any one is
celebrated by express divine testimony, unless it be in the
case of Noah, who commends with a prophetic benediction
his two sons Shem and Japheth, while he beheld and foresaw
what was long afterwards to happen. It was also by this
prophetic spirit that, when his middle son&mdash;that is, the son
who was younger than the first and older than the last born&mdash;had
sinned against him, he cursed him not in his own person,
but in his son's (his own grandson's), in the words, "Cursed
be the lad Canaan; a servant shall he be unto his brethren."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Now Canaan was born of Ham, who, so far from covering his
sleeping father's nakedness, had divulged it. For the same
reason also he subjoins the blessing on his two other sons, the
oldest and youngest, saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall gladden
Japheth, and he shall dwell in the houses of Shem."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
so, too, the planting of the vine by Noah, and his intoxication
by its fruit, and his nakedness while he slept, and the other
things done at that time, and recorded, are all of them pregnant
with prophetic meanings, and veiled in mysteries.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>


<p class="center">2. <i>What was prophetically prefigured in the sons of Noah.</i></p>

<p>The things which then were hidden are now sufficiently
revealed by the actual events which have followed. For who
can carefully and intelligently consider these things without
recognising them accomplished in Christ? Shem, of whom
Christ was born in the flesh, means "named." And what is
of greater name than Christ, the fragrance of whose name is
now everywhere perceived, so that even prophecy sings of it
beforehand, comparing it in the Song of Songs<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> to ointment
poured forth? Is it not also in the houses of Christ, that is,
in the churches, that the "enlargement" of the nations dwells?
For Japheth means "enlargement." And Ham (<i>i.e.</i> hot), who
was the middle son of Noah, and, as it were, separated himself
from both, and remained between them, neither belonging
to the first-fruits of Israel nor to the fulness of the Gentiles,
what does he signify but the tribe of heretics, hot with the
spirit, not of patience, but of impatience, with which the
breasts of heretics are wont to blaze, and with which they
disturb the peace of the saints? But even the heretics yield
an advantage to those that make proficiency, according to the
apostle's saying, "There must also be heresies, that they which
are approved may be made manifest among you."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Whence,
too, it is elsewhere said, "The son that receives instruction
will be wise, and he uses the foolish as his servant."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> For
while the hot restlessness of heretics stirs questions about
many articles of the catholic faith, the necessity of defending
them forces us both to investigate them more accurately, to
understand them more clearly, and to proclaim them more
earnestly; and the question mooted by an adversary becomes
the occasion of instruction. However, not only those who
are openly separated from the church, but also all who glory
in the Christian name, and at the same time lead abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
lives, may without absurdity seem to be figured by Noah's
middle son: for the passion of Christ, which was signified
by that man's nakedness, is at once proclaimed by their profession,
and dishonoured by their wicked conduct. Of such,
therefore, it has been said, "By their fruits ye shall know
them."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> And therefore was Ham cursed in his son, he being,
as it were, his fruit. So, too, this son of his, Canaan, is fitly
interpreted "their movement," which is nothing else than their
work. But Shem and Japheth, that is to say, the circumcision
and uncircumcision, or, as the apostle otherwise calls
them, the Jews and Greeks, but called and justified, having
somehow discovered the nakedness of their father (which
signifies the Saviour's passion), took a garment and laid it
upon their backs, and entered backwards and covered their
father's nakedness, without their seeing what their reverence
hid. For we both honour the passion of Christ as accomplished
for us, and we hate the crime of the Jews who crucified
Him. The garment signifies the sacrament, their backs
the memory of things past: for the church celebrates the
passion of Christ as already accomplished, and no longer
to be looked forward to, now that Japheth already dwells in
the habitations of Shem, and their wicked brother between
them.</p>

<p>But the wicked brother is, in the person of his son (<i>i.e.</i>
his work), the boy, or slave, of his good brothers, when good
men make a skilful use of bad men, either for the exercise of
their patience or for their advancement in wisdom. For the
apostle testifies that there are some who preach Christ from
no pure motives; "but," says he, "whether in pretence or in
truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and
will rejoice."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> For it is Christ Himself who planted the
vine of which the prophet says, "The vine of the Lord of
hosts is the house of Israel;"<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and He drinks of its wine,
whether we thus understand that cup of which He says, "Can
ye drink of the cup that I shall drink of?"<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and, "Father,
if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,"<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> by which He
obviously means His passion. Or, as wine is the fruit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the vine, we may prefer to understand that from this vine,
that is to say, from the race of Israel, He has assumed flesh
and blood that He might suffer; "and he was drunken," that
is, He suffered; "and was naked," that is, His weakness
appeared in His suffering, as the apostle says, "though He
was crucified through weakness."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Wherefore the same
apostle says, "The weakness of God is stronger than men;
and the foolishness of God is wiser than men."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> And when
to the expression "he was naked" Scripture adds "in his
house," it elegantly intimates that Jesus was to suffer the
cross and death at the hands of His own household, His own
kith and kin, the Jews. This passion of Christ is only
externally and verbally professed by the reprobate, for what
they profess they do not understand. But the elect hold in
the inner man this so great mystery, and honour inwardly in
the heart this weakness and foolishness of God. And of this
there is a figure in Ham going out to proclaim his father's
nakedness; while Shem and Japheth, to cover or honour it,
went in, that is to say, did it inwardly.</p>

<p>These secrets of divine Scripture we investigate as well as
we can. All will not accept our interpretation with equal
confidence, but all hold it certain that these things were
neither done nor recorded without some foreshadowing of
future events, and that they are to be referred only to Christ
and His church, which is the city of God, proclaimed from
the very beginning of human history by figures which we
now see everywhere accomplished. From the blessing of the
two sons of Noah, and the cursing of the middle son, down
to Abraham, or for more than a thousand years, there is, as
I have said, no mention of any righteous persons who worshipped
God. I do not therefore conclude that there were
none; but it had been tedious to mention every one, and
would have displayed historical accuracy rather than prophetic
foresight. The object of the writer of these sacred books, or
rather of the Spirit of God in him, is not only to record the
past, but to depict the future, so far as it regards the city of
God; for whatever is said of those who are not its citizens,
is given either for her instruction, or as a foil to enhance her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
glory. Yet we are not to suppose that all that is recorded
has some signification; but those things which have no signification
of their own are interwoven for the sake of the things
which are significant. It is only the ploughshare that cleaves
the soil; but to effect this, other parts of the plough are
requisite. It is only the strings in harps and other musical
instruments which produce melodious sounds; but that they
may do so, there are other parts of the instrument which are
not indeed struck by those who sing, but are connected with
the strings which are struck, and produce musical notes. So
in this prophetic history some things are narrated which have
no significance, but are, as it were, the framework to which the
significant things are attached.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Of the generations of the three sons of Noah.</i></p>

<p>We must therefore introduce into this work an explanation
of the generations of the three sons of Noah, in so far as that
may illustrate the progress in time of the two cities. Scripture
first mentions that of the youngest son, who is called Japheth:
he had eight sons,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and by two of these sons seven grandchildren,
three by one son, four by the other; in all, fifteen
descendants. Ham, Noah's middle son, had four sons, and
by one of them five grandsons, and by one of these two great-grandsons;
in all, eleven. After enumerating these, Scripture
returns to the first of the sons, and says, "Cush begat Nimrod;
he began to be a giant on the earth. He was a giant hunter
against the Lord God: wherefore they say, As Nimrod the
giant hunter against the Lord. And the beginning of his
kingdom was Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land
of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Assur, and built
Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between
Nineveh and Calah: this was a great city." Now this
Cush, father of the giant Nimrod, is the first-named among
the sons of Ham, to whom five sons and two grandsons are
ascribed. But he either begat this giant after his grandsons
were born, or, which is more credible, Scripture speaks of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
separately on account of his eminence; for mention is also
made of his kingdom, which began with that magnificent city
Babylon, and the other places, whether cities or districts,
mentioned along with it. But what is recorded of the land
of Shinar which belonged to Nimrod's kingdom, to wit, that
Assur went forth from it and built Nineveh and the other
cities mentioned with it, happened long after; but he takes
occasion to speak of it here on account of the grandeur of
the Assyrian kingdom, which was wonderfully extended by
Ninus son of Belus, and founder of the great city Nineveh,
which was named after him, Nineveh, from Ninus. But
Assur, father of the Assyrian, was not one of the sons of Ham,
Noah's middle son, but is found among the sons of Shem, his
eldest son. Whence it appears that among Shem's offspring
there arose men who afterwards took possession of that giant's
kingdom, and advancing from it, founded other cities, the first
of which was called Nineveh, from Ninus. From him Scripture
returns to Ham's other son, Mizraim; and his sons are
enumerated, not as seven individuals, but as seven nations.
And from the sixth, as if from the sixth son, the race called
the Philistines are said to have sprung; so that there are in
all eight. Then it returns again to Canaan, in whose person
Ham was cursed; and his eleven sons are named. Then the
territories they occupied, and some of the cities, are named.
And thus, if we count sons and grandsons, there are thirty-one
of Ham's descendants registered.</p>

<p>It remains to mention the sons of Shem, Noah's eldest
son; for to him this genealogical narrative gradually ascends
from the youngest. But in the commencement of the record
of Shem's sons there is an obscurity which calls for explanation,
since it is closely connected with the object of our investigation.
For we read, "Unto Shem also, the father of all
the children of Heber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were
children born."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This is the order of the words: And to
Shem was born Heber, even to himself, that is, to Shem himself
was born Heber, and Shem is the father of all his children.
We are intended to understand that Shem is the patriarch of all
his posterity who were to be mentioned, whether sons, grandsons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
great-grandsons, or descendants at any remove. For
Shem did not beget Heber, who was indeed in the fifth generation
from him. For Shem begat, among other sons, Arphaxad;
Arphaxad begat Cainan, Cainan begat Salah, Salah begat
Heber. And it was with good reason that he was named
first among Shem's offspring, taking precedence even of his
sons, though only a grandchild of the fifth generation; for
from him, as tradition says, the Hebrews derived their name,
though the other etymology which derives the name from
Abraham (as if <i>Abrahews</i>) may possibly be correct. But
there can be little doubt that the former is the right etymology,
and that they were called after Heber, <i>Heberews</i>, and
then, dropping a letter, Hebrews; and so was their language
called Hebrew, which was spoken by none but the people of
Israel among whom was the city of God, mysteriously prefigured
in all the people, and truly present in the saints.
Six of Shem's sons then are first named, then four grandsons
born to one of these sons; then it mentions another son of
Shem, who begat a grandson; and his son, again, or Shem's
great-grandson, was Heber. And Heber begat two sons, and
called the one Peleg, which means "dividing;" and Scripture
subjoins the reason of this name, saying, "for in his days was
the earth divided." What this means will afterwards appear.
Heber's other son begat twelve sons; consequently all Shem's
descendants are twenty-seven. The total number of the progeny
of the three sons of Noah is seventy-three, fifteen by
Japheth, thirty-one by Ham, twenty-seven by Shem. Then
Scripture adds, "These are the sons of Shem, after their
families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
And so of the whole number: "These are the families of the
sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations; and
by these were the isles of the nations dispersed through the
earth after the flood." From which we gather that the
seventy-three (or rather, as I shall presently show, seventy-two)
were not individuals, but nations. For in a former passage,
when the sons of Japheth were enumerated, it is said in conclusion,
"By these were the isles of the nations divided in
their lands, every one after his language, in their tribes, and
in their nations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>But nations are expressly mentioned among the sons of
Ham, as I showed above. "Mizraim begat those who are
called Ludim;" and so also of the other seven nations. And
after enumerating all of them, it concludes, "These are the
sons of Ham, in their families, according to their languages, in
their territories, and in their nations." The reason, then, why
the children of several of them are not mentioned, is that they
belonged by birth to other nations, and did not themselves
become nations. Why else is it, that though eight sons are
reckoned to Japheth, the sons of only two of these are mentioned;
and though four are reckoned to Ham, only three are
spoken of as having sons; and though six are reckoned to
Shem, the descendants of only two of these are traced? Did
the rest remain childless? We cannot suppose so; but they
did not produce nations so great as to warrant their being
mentioned, but were absorbed in the nations to which they
belonged by birth.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the diversity of languages, and of the founding of Babylon.</i></p>

<p>But though these nations are said to have been dispersed
according to their languages, yet the narrator recurs to that
time when all had but one language, and explains how it
came to pass that a diversity of languages was introduced.
"The whole earth," he says, "was of one lip, and all had one
speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the
east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt
there. And they said one to another, Come, and let us make
bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had bricks for
stone, and slime for mortar. And they said, Come, and let us
build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top shall reach
the sky; and let us make us a name, before we be scattered
abroad on the face of all the earth. And the Lord came down
to see the city and the tower, which the children, of men
builded. And the Lord God said, Behold, the people is one,
and they have all one language; and this they begin to do:
and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they
have imagined to do. Come, and let us go down, and confound
there their language, that they may not understand one
another's speech. And God scattered them thence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city and
the tower. Therefore the name of it is called Confusion;
because the Lord did there confound the language of all the
earth: and the Lord God scattered them thence on the face of
all the earth."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> This city, which was called Confusion, is the
same as Babylon, whose wonderful construction Gentile history
also notices. For Babylon means Confusion. Whence we
conclude that the giant Nimrod was its founder, as had been
hinted a little before, where Scripture, in speaking of him,
says that the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, that is,
Babylon had a supremacy over the other cities as the metropolis
and royal residence; although it did not rise to the
grand dimensions designed by its proud and impious founder.
The plan was to make it so high that it should reach the sky,
whether this was meant of one tower which they intended to
build higher than the others, or of all the towers, which might
be signified by the singular number, as we speak of "the
soldier," meaning the army, and of the frog or the locust, when
we refer to the whole multitude of frogs and locusts in the
plagues with which Moses smote the Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But what
did these vain and presumptuous men intend? How did
they expect to raise this lofty mass against God, when they
had built it above all the mountains and the clouds of the
earth's atmosphere? What injury could any spiritual or
material elevation do to God? The safe and true way to
heaven is made by humility, which lifts up the heart to the
Lord, not against Him; as this giant is said to have been a
"hunter <i>against</i> the Lord." This has been misunderstood by
some through the ambiguity of the Greek word, and they have
translated it, not "against the Lord," but "before the Lord;"
for &#7956;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; means both "before" and "against." In the
Psalm this word is rendered, "Let us weep <i>before</i> the Lord
our Maker."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The same word occurs in the book of Job,
where it is written, "Thou hast broken into fury <i>against</i> the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> And so this giant is to be recognised as a "hunter
<i>against</i> the Lord." And what is meant by the term "hunter"
but deceiver, oppressor, and destroyer of the animals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
earth? He and his people, therefore, erected this tower
against the Lord, and so gave expression to their impious
pride; and justly was their wicked intention punished by
God, even though it was unsuccessful. But what was the
nature of the punishment? As the tongue is the instrument
of domination, in it pride was punished; so that man, who
would not understand God when He issued His commands,
should be misunderstood when he himself gave orders. Thus
was that conspiracy disbanded, for each man retired from
those he could not understand, and associated with those
whose speech was intelligible; and the nations were divided
according to their languages, and scattered over the earth as
seemed good to God, who accomplished this in ways hidden
from and incomprehensible to us.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of God's coming down to confound the languages of the builders of the city.</i></p>

<p>We read, "The Lord came down to see the city and the
tower which the sons of men built:" it was not the sons of
God, but that society which lived in a merely human way,
and which we call the earthly city. God, who is always
wholly everywhere, does not move locally; but He is said to
descend when He does anything in the earth out of the usual
course, which, as it were, makes His presence felt. And in
the same way, He does not by "seeing" learn some new
thing, for He cannot ever be ignorant of anything; but He is
said to see and recognise, in time, that which He causes
others to see and recognise. And therefore that city was
not previously being seen as God made it be seen when He
showed how offensive it was to Him. We might, indeed,
interpret God's descending to the city of the descent of His
angels in whom He dwells; so that the following words,
"And the Lord God said, Behold, they are all one race and
of one language," and also what follows, "Come, and let us
go down and confound their speech," are a recapitulation, explaining
how the previously intimated "descent of the Lord"
was accomplished. For if He had already gone down, why
does He say, "Come, and let us go down and confound?"&mdash;words
which seem to be addressed to the angels, and to intimate
that He who was in the angels descended in their descent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
And the words most appropriately are, not, "Go ye
down and confound," but, "Let us confound their speech;"
showing that He so works by His servants, that they are
themselves also fellow-labourers with God, as the apostle says,
"For we are fellow-labourers with God."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>


<p class="center">6. <i>What we are to understand by God's speaking to the angels.</i></p>

<p>We might have supposed that the words uttered at the
creation of man, "Let us," and not Let me, "make man," were
addressed to the angels, had He not added "in our image;"
but as we cannot believe that man was made in the image of
angels, or that the image of God is the same as that of angels,
it is proper to refer this expression to the plurality of the
Trinity. And yet this Trinity, being one God, even after
saying "Let <i>us</i> make," goes on to say, "And God made man
in His image,"<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and not "Gods made," or "in their image."
And were there any difficulty in applying to the angels the
words, "Come, and let us go down and confound their speech,"
we might refer the plural to the Trinity, as if the Father were
addressing the Son and the Holy Spirit; but it rather belongs
to the angels to approach God by holy movements, that is,
by pious thoughts, and thereby to avail themselves of the unchangeable
truth which rules in the court of heaven as their
eternal law. For they are not themselves the truth; but partaking
in the creative truth, they are moved towards it as the
fountain of life, that what they have not in themselves they
may obtain in it. And this movement of theirs is steady,
for they never go back from what they have reached. And
to these angels God does not speak, as we speak to one another,
or to God, or to angels, or as the angels speak to us, or
as God speaks to us through them: He speaks to them in an
ineffable manner of His own, and that which He says is conveyed
to us in a manner suited to our capacity. For the
speaking of God antecedent and superior to all His works,
is the immutable reason of His work: it has no noisy and
passing sound, but an energy eternally abiding and producing
results in time. Thus He speaks to the holy angels; but to
us, who are far off, He speaks otherwise. When, however, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
hear with the inner ear some part of the speech of God, we
approximate to the angels. But in this work I need not
labour to give an account of the ways in which God speaks.
For either the unchangeable Truth speaks directly to the mind
of the rational creature in some indescribable way, or speaks
through the changeable creature, either presenting spiritual

Noah we mean, 73, or rather, as the catalogue will show, 72
nations and as many languages were dispersed over the earth,
and as they increased filled even the islands. But the nations
multiplied much more than the languages. For even in
Africa we know several barbarous nations which have but
one language; and who can doubt that, as the human race
increased, men contrived to pass to the islands in ships?</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Whether even the remotest islands received their</i> <span class="smcap">fauna</span> <i>from the animals
which were preserved, through the deluge, in the ark</i>.</p>

<p>There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts
which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs from
the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents,
such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how
they could be found in the islands after the deluge, in which
all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was
restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark.
It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by
swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the
mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy
no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated
these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an
incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot
be denied that by the intervention of angels they might
be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however,
they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation,
when God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature,"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals
were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing
the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which
were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident,
if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which
they could not cross over.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Whether certain monstrous races of men are derived from the stock of Adam
or Noah's sons.</i></p>

<p>It is also asked whether we are to believe that certain
monstrous races of men, spoken of in secular history,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> have
sprung from Noah's sons, or rather, I should say, from that
one man from whom they themselves were descended. For
it is reported that some have one eye in the middle of the
forehead; some, feet turned backwards from the heel; some,
a double sex, the right breast like a man, the left like a woman,
and that they alternately beget and bring forth: others
are said to have no mouth, and to breathe only through the
nostrils; others are but a cubit high, and are therefore called
by the Greeks "Pigmies:"<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> they say that in some places the
women conceive in their fifth year, and do not live beyond
their eighth. So, too, they tell of a race who have two feet
but only one leg, and are of marvellous swiftness, though they
do not bend the knee: they are called Skiopodes, because in
the hot weather they lie down on their backs and shade themselves
with their feet. Others are said to have no head, and
their eyes in their shoulders; and other human or quasi-human
races are depicted in mosaic in the harbour esplanade
of Carthage, on the faith of histories of rarities. What shall
I say of the Cynocephali, whose dog-like head and barking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
proclaim them beasts rather than men? But we are not
bound to believe all we hear of these monstrosities. But
whoever is anywhere born a man, that is, a rational mortal
animal, no matter what unusual appearance he presents in
colour, movement, sound, nor how peculiar he is in some
power, part, or quality of his nature, no Christian can doubt
that he springs from that one protoplast. We can distinguish
the common human nature from that which is peculiar, and
therefore wonderful.</p>

<p>The same account which is given of monstrous births in
individual cases can be given of monstrous races. For God,
the Creator of all, knows where and when each thing ought to
be, or to have been created, because He sees the similarities
and diversities which can contribute to the beauty of the
whole. But he who cannot see the whole is offended by
the deformity of the part, because he is blind to that which
balances it, and to which it belongs. We know that men are
born with more than four fingers on their hands or toes on
their feet: this is a smaller matter; but far from us be the
folly of supposing that the Creator mistook the number of a
man's fingers, though we cannot account for the difference.
And so in cases where the divergence from the rule is greater.
He whose works no man justly finds fault with, knows what
He has done. At Hippo-Diarrhytus there is a man whose
hands are crescent-shaped, and have only two fingers each,
and his feet similarly formed. If there were a race like him,
it would be added to the history of the curious and wonderful.
Shall we therefore deny that this man is descended
from that one man who was first created? As for the Androgyni,
or Hermaphrodites, as they are called, though they are
rare, yet from time to time there appear persons of sex so
doubtful, that it remains uncertain from which sex they take
their name; though it is customary to give them a masculine
name, as the more worthy. For no one ever called them
Hermaphroditesses. Some years ago, quite within my own
memory, a man was born in the East, double in his upper,
but single in his lower half&mdash;having two heads, two chests,
four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man;
and he lived so long that many had an opportunity of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
him. But who could enumerate all the human births that have
differed widely from their ascertained parents? As, therefore,
no one will deny that these are all descended from that one
man, so all the races which are reported to have diverged in
bodily appearance from the usual course which nature generally
or almost universally preserves, if they are embraced in
that definition of man as rational and mortal animals, unquestionably
trace their pedigree to that one first father of all.
We are supposing these stories about various races who differ
from one another and from us to be true; but possibly they are
not: for if we were not aware that apes, and monkeys, and
sphinxes are not men, but beasts, those historians would possibly
describe them as races of men, and flaunt with impunity
their false and vainglorious discoveries. But supposing they
are men of whom these marvels are recorded, what if God has
seen fit to create some races in this way, that we might not
suppose that the monstrous births which appear among ourselves
are the failures of that wisdom whereby He fashions
the human nature, as we speak of the failure of a less perfect
workman? Accordingly, it ought not to seem absurd to us,
that as in individual races there are monstrous births, so in
the whole race there are monstrous races. Wherefore, to conclude
this question cautiously and guardedly, either these
things which have been told of some races have no existence
at all; or if they do exist, they are not human races; or if
they are human, they are descended from Adam.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether we are to believe in the Antipodes.</i></p>

<p>But as to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say,
men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises
when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours,
that is on no ground credible. And, indeed, it is not affirmed
that this has been learned by historical knowledge, but by
scientific conjecture, on the ground that the earth is suspended
within the concavity of the sky, and that it has as much room
on the one side of it as on the other: hence they say that
the part which is beneath must also be inhabited. But they
do not remark that, although it be supposed or scientifically
demonstrated that the world is of a round and spherical form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
yet it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare
of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately
follow that it is peopled. For Scripture, which proves the
truth of its historical statements by the accomplishment of its
prophecies, gives no false information; and it is too absurd to
say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the
whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to
the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant
region are descended from that one first man. Wherefore let
us seek if we can find the city of God that sojourns on earth
among those human races who are catalogued as having been
divided into seventy-two nations and as many languages. For
it continued down to the deluge and the ark, and is proved to
have existed still among the sons of Noah by their blessings,
and chiefly in the eldest son Shem; for Japheth received this
blessing, that he should dwell in the tents of Shem.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the genealogy of Shem, in whose line the city of God is preserved till the
time of Abraham.</i></p>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, to preserve the series of generations
descending from Shem, for the sake of exhibiting the
city of God after the flood; as before the flood it was exhibited
in the series of generations descending from Seth. And therefore
does divine Scripture, after exhibiting the earthly city as
Babylon or "Confusion," revert to the patriarch Shem, and
recapitulate the generations from him to Abraham, specifying
besides, the year in which each father begat the son that belonged
to this line, and how long he lived. And unquestionably
it is this which fulfils the promise I made, that it should
appear why it is said of the sons of Heber, "The name of the
one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> For
what can we understand by the division of the earth, if not
the diversity of languages? And, therefore, omitting the
other sons of Shem, who are not concerned in this matter,
Scripture gives the genealogy of those by whom the line runs
on to Abraham, as before the flood those are given who carried
on the line to Noah from Seth. Accordingly this series of
generations begins thus: "These are the generations of Shem:
Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
years after the flood. And Shem lived after he begat
Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
In like manner it registers the rest, naming the year of his
life in which each begat the son who belonged to that line
which extends to Abraham. It specifies, too, how many years
he lived thereafter, begetting sons and daughters, that we may
not childishly suppose that the men named were the only
men, but may understand how the population increased, and
how regions and kingdoms so vast could be populated by the
descendants of Shem; especially the kingdom of Assyria, from
which Ninus subdued the surrounding nations, reigning with
brilliant prosperity, and bequeathing to his descendants a vast
but thoroughly consolidated empire, which held together for
many centuries.</p>

<p>But to avoid needless prolixity, we shall mention not the
number of years each member of this series lived, but only
the year of his life in which he begat his heir, that we may
thus reckon the number of years from the flood to Abraham,
and may at the same time leave room to touch briefly and
cursorily upon some other matters necessary to our argument.
In the second year, then, after the flood, Shem when he was
a hundred years old begat Arphaxad; Arphaxad when he was
135 years old begat Cainan; Cainan when he was 130 years
begat Salah. Salah himself, too, was the same age when he
begat Eber. Eber lived 134 years, and begat Peleg, in whose
days the earth was divided. Peleg himself lived 130 years,
and begat Reu; and Reu lived 132 years, and begat Serug;
Serug 130, and begat Nahor; and Nahor 79, and begat Terah;
and Terah 70, and begat Abram, whose name God afterwards
changed into <i>Abraham</i>. There are thus from the flood to
Abraham 1072 years, according to the Vulgate or Septuagint
versions. In the Hebrew copies far fewer years are given; and
for this either no reason or a not very credible one is given.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we look for the city of God in these
seventy-two nations, we cannot affirm that while they had
but one lip, that is, one language, the human race had departed
from the worship of the true God, and that genuine
godliness had survived only in those generations which descend
from Shem through Arphaxad and reach to Abraham;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
but from the time when they proudly built a tower to heaven,
a symbol of godless exaltation, the city or society of the
wicked becomes apparent. Whether it was only disguised
before, or non-existent; whether both cities remained after the
flood,&mdash;the godly in the two sons of Noah who were blessed, and
in their posterity, and the ungodly in the cursed son and his
descendants, from whom sprang that mighty hunter against
the Lord,&mdash;is not easily determined. For possibly&mdash;and certainly
this is more credible&mdash;there were despisers of God
among the descendants of the two sons, even before Babylon
was founded, and worshippers of God among the descendants
of Ham. Certainly neither race was ever obliterated from
earth. For in both the Psalms in which it is said, "They
are all gone aside, they are altogether become filthy; there is
none that doeth good, no, not one," we read further, "Have
all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> There
was then a people of God even at that time. And therefore
the words, "There is none that doeth good, no, not one," were
said of the sons of men, not of the sons of God. For it had
been previously said, "God looked down from heaven upon
the sons of men, to see if any understood and sought after
God;" and then follow the words which demonstrate that all
the sons of men, that is, all who belong to the city which
lives according to man, not according to God, are reprobate.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>11. <i>That the original language in use among men was that which was afterwards
called Hebrew, from Heber, in whose family it was preserved when the
confusion of tongues occurred.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore, as the fact of all using one language did not
secure the absence of sin-infected men from the race,&mdash;for even
before the deluge there was one language, and yet all but the
single family of just Noah were found worthy of destruction
by the flood,&mdash;so when the nations, by a prouder godlessness,
earned the punishment of the dispersion and the confusion of
tongues, and the city of the godless was called Confusion or
Babylon, there was still the house of Heber in which the primitive
language of the race survived. And therefore, as I
have already mentioned, when an enumeration is made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
sons of Shem, who each founded a nation, Heber is first mentioned,
although he was of the fifth generation from Shem.
And because, when the other races were divided by their own
peculiar languages, his family preserved that language which
is not unreasonably believed to have been the common
language of the race, it was on this account thenceforth
named Hebrew. For it then became necessary to distinguish
this language from the rest by a proper name; though, while
there was only one, it had no other name than the language
of man, or human speech, it alone being spoken by the whole
human race. Some one will say: If the earth was divided
by languages in the days of Peleg, Heber's son, that language,
which was formerly common to all, should rather have been
called after Peleg. But we are to understand that Heber
himself gave to his son this name Peleg, which means Division;
because he was born when the earth was divided, that is, at
the very time of the division, and that this is the meaning of
the words, "In his days the earth was divided."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> For unless
Heber had been still alive when the languages were multiplied,
the language which was preserved in his house would not
have been called after him. We are induced to believe that
this was the primitive and common language, because the
multiplication and change of languages was introduced as a
punishment, and it is fit to ascribe to the people of God an
immunity from this punishment. Nor is it without significance
that this is the language which Abraham retained, and
that he could not transmit it to all his descendants, but only
to those of Jacob's line, who distinctively and eminently constituted
God's people, and received His covenants, and were
Christ's progenitors according to the flesh. In the same way,
Heber himself did not transmit that language to all his posterity,
but only to the line from which Abraham sprang. And
thus, although it is not expressly stated, that when the wicked
were building Babylon there was a godly seed remaining, this
indistinctness is intended to stimulate research rather than to
elude it. For when we see that originally there was one
common language, and that Heber is mentioned before all
Shem's sons, though he belonged to the fifth generation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
him, and that the language which the patriarchs and prophets
used, not only in their conversation, but in the authoritative
language of Scripture, is called Hebrew, when we are asked
where that primitive and common language was preserved
after the confusion of tongues, certainly, as there can be no
doubt that those among whom it was preserved were exempt
from the punishment it embodied, what other suggestion can
we make, than that it survived in the family of him whose
name it took, and that this is no small proof of the righteousness
of this family, that the punishment with which the other
families were visited did not fall upon it?</p>

<p>But yet another question is mooted: How did Heber and
his son Peleg each found a nation, if they had but one language?
For no doubt the Hebrew nation propagated from Heber through
Abraham, and becoming through him a great people, is one
nation. How, then, are all the sons of the three branches of
Noah's family enumerated as founding a nation each, if Heber
and Peleg did not so? It is very probable that the giant
Nimrod founded also his nation, and that Scripture has named
him separately on account of the extraordinary dimensions of
his empire and of his body, so that the number of seventy-two
nations remains. But Peleg was mentioned, not because he
founded a nation (for his race and language are Hebrew), but
on account of the critical time at which he was born, all the
earth being then divided. Nor ought we to be surprised that
the giant Nimrod lived to the time in which Babylon was
founded and the confusion of tongues occurred, and the consequent
division of the earth. For though Heber was in the
sixth generation from Noah, and Nimrod in the fourth, it does
not follow that they could not be alive at the same time. For
when the generations are few, they live longer and are born
later; but when they are many, they live a shorter time, and
come into the world earlier. We are to understand that, when
the earth was divided, the descendants of Noah who are registered
as founders of nations were not only already born, but
were of an age to have immense families, worthy to be called
tribes or nations. And therefore we must by no means
suppose that they were born in the order in which they were
set down; otherwise, how could the twelve sons of Joktan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
another son of Heber's, and brother of Peleg, have already
founded nations, if Joktan was born, as he is registered, after
his brother Peleg, since the earth was divided at Peleg's birth?
We are therefore to understand that, though Peleg is named
first, he was born long after Joktan, whose twelve sons had
already families so large as to admit of their being divided by
different languages. There is nothing extraordinary in the
last born being first named: of the sons of Noah, the descendants
of Japheth are first named; then the sons of Ham, who
was the second son; and last the sons of Shem, who was the
first and oldest. Of these nations the names have partly survived,
so that at this day we can see from whom they have
sprung, as the Assyrians from Assur, the Hebrews from Heber,
but partly have been altered in the lapse of time, so that the
most learned men, by profound research in ancient records,
have scarcely been able to discover the origin, I do not say of
all, but of some of these nations. There is, for example,
nothing in the name Egyptians to show that they are descended
from Misraim, Ham's son, nor in the name Ethiopians to show
a connection with Cush, though such is said to be the origin
of these nations. And if we take a general survey of the
names, we shall find that more have been changed than have
remained the same.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the era in Abraham's life from which a new period in the holy
succession begins.</i></p>

<p>Let us now survey the progress of the city of God from the
era of the patriarch Abraham, from whose time it begins to
be more conspicuous, and the divine promises which are now
fulfilled in Christ are more fully revealed. We learn, then,
from the intimations of holy Scripture, that Abraham was
born in the country of the Chaldeans, a land belonging to
the Assyrian empire. Now, even at that time impious superstitions
were rife with the Chaldeans, as with other nations.
The family of Terah, to which Abraham belonged, was the
only one in which the worship of the true God survived, and
the only one, we may suppose, in which the Hebrew language
was preserved; although Joshua the son of Nun tells us that
even this family served other gods in Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
other descendants of Heber gradually became absorbed in other
races and other languages. And thus, as the single family of
Noah was preserved through the deluge of water to renew the
human race, so, in the deluge of superstition that flooded the
whole world, there remained but the one family of Terah in
which the seed of God's city was preserved. And as, when
Scripture has enumerated the generations prior to Noah, with
their ages, and explained the cause of the flood before God
began to speak to Noah about the building of the ark, it is
said, "These are the generations of Noah;" so also now, after
enumerating the generations from Shem, Noah's son, down to
Abraham, it then signalizes an era by saying, "These are the
generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran;
and Haran begat Lot. And Haran died before his father
Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. And
Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's
wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the
daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of
Iscah."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> This Iscah is supposed to be the same as Sarah,
Abraham's wife.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>13. <i>Why, in the account of Terah's emigration, on his forsaking the Chaldeans
and passing over into Mesopotamia, no mention is made of his son Nahor.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Next it is related how Terah with his family left the
region of the Chaldeans and came into Mesopotamia, and
dwelt in Haran. But nothing is said about one of his sons
called Nahor, as if he had not taken him along with him.
For the narrative runs thus: "And Terah took Abram his
son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarah his
daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and led them forth
out of the region of the Chaldeans to go into the land of
Canaan; and he came into Haran, and dwelt there."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Nahor
and Milcah his wife are nowhere named here. But afterwards,
when Abraham sent his servant to take a wife for his
son Isaac, we find it thus written: "And the servant took ten
camels of the camels of his lord, and of all the goods of his
lord, with him; and arose, and went into Mesopotamia, into the
city of Nahor."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> This and other testimonies of this sacred
history show that Nahor, Abraham's brother, had also left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
region of the Chaldeans, and fixed his abode in Mesopotamia,
where Abraham dwelt with his father. Why, then, did the
Scripture not mention him, when Terah with his family went
forth out of the Chaldean nation and dwelt in Haran, since it
mentions that he took with him not only Abraham his son,
but also Sarah his daughter-in-law, and Lot his grandson?
The only reason we can think of is, that perhaps he had lapsed
from the piety of his father and brother, and adhered to the
superstition of the Chaldeans, and had afterwards emigrated
thence, either through penitence, or because he was persecuted
as a suspected person. For in the book called Judith, when
Holofernes, the enemy of the Israelites, inquired what kind of
nation that might be, and whether war should be made against
them, Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, answered him thus:
"Let our lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant,
and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning the
people which dwelleth near thee in this hill country, and
there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant. For
this people is descended from the Chaldeans, and they dwelt
heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the
gods of their fathers, which were glorious in the land of the
Chaldeans, but went out of the way of their ancestors, and
adored the God of heaven, whom they knew; and they cast
them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia,
and dwelt there many days. And their God said to
them, that they should depart from their habitation, and go
into the land of Canaan; and they dwelt,"<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> etc., as Achior the
Ammonite narrates. Whence it is manifest that the house of
Terah had suffered persecution from the Chaldeans for the
true piety with which they worshipped the one and true God.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the years of Terah, who completed his lifetime in Haran.</i></p>

<p>On Terah's death in Mesopotamia, where he is said to have
lived 205 years, the promises of God made to Abraham now
begin to be pointed out; for thus it is written: "And the days
of Terah in Haran were two hundred and five years, and he
died in Haran."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> This is not to be taken as if he had spent
all his days there, but that he there completed the days of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
life, which were two hundred and five years: otherwise it
would not be known how many years Terah lived, since it is
not said in what year of his life he came into Haran; and it is
absurd to suppose that, in this series of generations, where it
is carefully recorded how many years each one lived, his age
was the only one not put on record. For although some
whom the same Scripture mentions have not their age recorded,
they are not in this series, in which the reckoning of
time is continuously indicated by the death of the parents and
the succession of the children. For this series, which is given
in order from Adam to Noah, and from him down to Abraham,
contains no one without the number of the years of his life.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the time of the migration of Abraham, when, according to the commandment
of God, he went out from Haran.</i></p>

<p>When, after the record of the death of Terah, the father of
Abraham, we next read, "And the Lord said to Abram, Get
thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father's house,"<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> etc., it is not to be supposed, because this
follows in the order of the narrative, that it also followed in
the chronological order of events. For if it were so, there
would be an insoluble difficulty. For after these words of
God which were spoken to Abraham, the Scripture says: "And
Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot
went with him. Now Abraham was seventy-five years old
when he departed out of Haran."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> How can this be true if he
departed from Haran after his father's death? For when Terah
was seventy years old, as is intimated above, he begat Abraham;
and if to this number we add the seventy-five years which
Abraham reckoned when he went out of Haran, we get 145
years. Therefore that was the number of the years of Terah,
when Abraham departed out of that city of Mesopotamia;
for he had reached the seventy-fifth year of his life, and
thus his father, who begat him in the seventieth year of his
life, had reached, as was said, his 145th. Therefore he did not
depart thence after his father's death, that is, after the 205
years his father lived; but the year of his departure from
that place, seeing it was his seventy-fifth, is inferred beyond
a doubt to have been the 145th of his father, who begat him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
in his seventieth year. And thus it is to be understood that
the Scripture, according to its custom, has gone back to the
time which had already been passed by the narrative; just as
above, when it had mentioned the grandsons of Noah, it said
that they were in their nations and tongues; and yet afterwards,
as if this also had followed in order of time, it says,
"And the whole earth was of one lip, and one speech for all."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
How, then, could they be said to be in their own nations and
according to their own tongues, if there was one for all; except
because the narrative goes back to gather up what it had
passed over? Here, too, in the same way, after saying, "And
the days of Terah in Haran were 205 years, and Terah died
in Haran," the Scripture, going back to what had been passed
over in order to complete what had been begun about Terah,
says, "And the Lord said to Abram, Get thee out of thy
country,"<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> etc. After which words of God it is added, "And
Abram departed, as the Lord spake unto him; and Lot went
with him. But Abram was seventy-five years old when he
departed out of Haran." Therefore it was done when his
father was in the 145th year of his age; for it was then the
seventy-fifth of his own. But this question is also solved in
another way, that the seventy-five years of Abraham when he
departed out of Haran are reckoned from the year in which
he was delivered from the fire of the Chaldeans, not from that
of his birth, as if he was rather to be held as having been
born then.</p>

<p>Now the blessed Stephen, in narrating these things in the
Acts of the Apostles, says: "The God of glory appeared unto
our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he
dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
and come into the land which I will show thee."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> According
to these words of Stephen, God spoke to Abraham, not
after the death of his father, who certainly died in Haran,
where his son also dwelt with him, but before he dwelt in
that city, although he was already in Mesopotamia. Therefore
he had already departed from the Chaldeans. So that
when Stephen adds, "Then Abraham went out of the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran,"<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> this does not point
out what took place after God spoke to him (for it was not
after these words of God that he went out of the land of
the Chaldeans, since he says that God spoke to him in Mesopotamia),
but the word "<i>then</i>" which he uses refers to that
whole period from his going out of the land of the Chaldeans
and dwelling in Haran. Likewise in what follows, "And
thenceforth, when his father was dead, he settled him in this
land, wherein ye now dwell, and your fathers," he does not
say, after his father was dead he went out from Haran; but
thenceforth he settled him here, after his father was dead. It
is to be understood, therefore, that God had spoken to Abraham
when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran;
but that he came to Haran with his father, keeping in mind
the precept of God, and that he went out thence in his own
seventy-fifth year, which was his father's 145th. But he says
that his settlement in the land of Canaan, not his going forth
from Haran, took place after his father's death; because his
father was already dead when he purchased the land, and personally
entered on possession of it. But when, on his having
already settled in Mesopotamia, that is, already gone out of
the land of the Chaldeans, God says, "Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,"<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
this means, not that he should cast out his body from thence,
for he had already done that, but that he should tear away
his soul. For he had not gone out from thence in mind, if
he was held by the hope and desire of returning,&mdash;a hope and
desire which was to be cut off by God's command and help,
and by his own obedience. It would indeed be no incredible
supposition that afterwards, when Nahor followed his father,
Abraham then fulfilled the precept of the Lord, that he should
depart out of Haran with Sarah his wife and Lot his brother's
son.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the order and nature of the promises of God which were made to
Abraham.</i></p>

<p>God's promises made to Abraham are now to be considered;
for in these the oracles of our God,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> that is, of the true God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
began to appear more openly concerning the godly people,
whom prophetic authority foretold. The first of these reads
thus: "And the Lord said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
and go into a land that I will show thee: and I will make of
thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy
name; and thou shalt be blessed: and I will bless them that
bless thee, and curse them that curse thee: and in thee shall
all tribes of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Now it is to be observed
that two things are promised to Abraham, the one, that his
seed should possess the land of Canaan, which is intimated
when it is said, "Go into a land that I will show thee, and I
will make of thee a great nation;" but the other far more
excellent, not about the carnal but the spiritual seed, through
which he is the father, not of the one Israelite nation, but of
all nations who follow the footprints of his faith, which was
first promised in these words, "And in thee shall all tribes of
the earth be blessed." Eusebius thought this promise was
made in Abraham's seventy-fifth year, as if soon after it was
made Abraham had departed out of Haran; because the Scripture
cannot be contradicted, in which we read, "Abram was
seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
But if this promise was made in that year, then of course
Abraham was staying in Haran with his father; for he could
not depart thence unless he had first dwelt there. Does this,
then, contradict what Stephen says, "The God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
before he dwelt in Charran?"<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> But it is to be understood that
the whole took place in the same year,&mdash;both the promise of
God before Abraham dwelt in Haran, and his dwelling in
Haran, and his departure thence,&mdash;not only because Eusebius
in the Chronicles reckons from the year of this promise, and
shows that after 430 years the exodus from Egypt took place,
when the law was given, but because the Apostle Paul also
mentions it.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>17. <i>Of the three most famous kingdoms of the nations, of which one, that is, the
Assyrian, was already very eminent when Abraham was born.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>During the same period there were three famous kingdoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of the nations, in which the city of the earth-born, that is, the
society of men living according to man under the domination
of the fallen angels, chiefly flourished, namely, the three kingdoms
of Sicyon, Egypt, and Assyria. Of these, Assyria was
much the most powerful and sublime; for that king Ninus,
son of Belus, had subdued the people of all Asia except India.
By Asia I now mean not that part which is one province of
this greater Asia, but what is called Universal Asia, which
some set down as the half, but most as the third part of the
whole world,&mdash;the three being Asia, Europe, and Africa, thereby
making an unequal division. For the part called Asia stretches
from the south through the east even to the north; Europe
from the north even to the west; and Africa from the west
even to the south. Thus we see that two, Europe and Africa,
contain one half of the world, and Asia alone the other half.
And these two parts are made by the circumstance, that there
enters between them from the ocean all the Mediterranean water,
which makes this great sea of ours. So that, if you divide the
world into two parts, the east and the west, Asia will be in the
one, and Europe and Africa in the other. So that of the three
kingdoms then famous, one, namely Sicyon, was not under
the Assyrians, because it was in Europe; but as for Egypt,
how could it fail to be subject to the empire which ruled all
Asia with the single exception of India? In Assyria, therefore,
the dominion of the impious city had the pre-eminence.
Its head was Babylon,&mdash;an earth-born city, most fitly named,
for it means confusion. There Ninus reigned after the death of
his father Belus, who first had reigned there sixty-five years.
His son Ninus, who, on his father's death, succeeded to the
kingdom, reigned fifty-two years, and had been king forty-three
years when Abraham was born, which was about the
1200th year before Rome was founded, as it were another
Babylon in the west.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the repeated address of God to Abraham, in which He promised the
land of Canaan to him and to his seed.</i></p>

<p>Abraham, then, having departed out of Haran in the
seventy-fifth year of his own age, and in the hundred and
forty-fifth of his father's, went with Lot, his brother's son,
and Sarah his wife, into the land of Canaan, and came even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Sichem, where again he received the divine oracle, of which
it is thus written: "And the Lord appeared unto Abram,
and said unto him, Unto thy seed will I give this land."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
Nothing is promised here about that seed in which he is
made the father of all nations, but only about that by which
he is the father of the one Israelite nation; for by this seed
that land was possessed.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the divine preservation of Sarah's chastity in Egypt, when Abraham
had called her not his wife but his sister.</i></p>

<p>Having built an altar there, and called upon God, Abraham
proceeded thence and dwelt in the desert, and was compelled by
pressure of famine to go on into Egypt. There he called his
wife his sister, and told no lie. For she was this also, because
she was near of blood; just as Lot, on account of the same
nearness, being his brother's son, is called his brother. Now
he did not deny that she was his wife, but held his peace
about it, committing to God the defence of his wife's chastity,
and providing as a man against human wiles; because if he
had not provided against the danger as much as he could, he
would have been tempting God rather than trusting in Him.
We have said enough about this matter against the calumnies
of Faustus the Manichæan. At last what Abraham had expected
the Lord to do took place. For Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, who had taken her to him as his wife, restored her to
her husband on being severely plagued. And far be it from
us to believe that she was defiled by lying with another;
because it is much more credible that, by these great afflictions,
Pharaoh was not permitted to do this.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the parting of Lot and Abraham, which they agreed to without breach
of charity.</i></p>

<p>On Abraham's return out of Egypt to the place he had left,
Lot, his brother's son, departed from him into the land of Sodom,
without breach of charity. For they had grown rich, and
began to have many herdmen of cattle, and when these strove
together, they avoided in this way the pugnacious discord of
their families. Indeed, as human affairs go, this cause might
even have given rise to some strife between themselves. Consequently
these are the words of Abraham to Lot, when taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
precaution against this evil, "Let there be no strife between
me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for
we be brethren. Behold, is not the whole land before thee?
Separate thyself from me: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I
will go to the right; or if thou wilt go to the right hand, I
will go to the left."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> From this, perhaps, has arisen a pacific
custom among men, that when there is any partition of earthly
things, the greater should make the division, the less the
choice.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the third promise of God, by which He assured the land of Canaan to
Abraham and his seed in perpetuity.</i></p>

<p>Now, when Abraham and Lot had separated, and dwelt
apart, owing to the necessity of supporting their families, and
not to vile discord, and Abraham was in the land of Canaan,
but Lot in Sodom, the Lord said to Abraham in a third oracle,
"Lift up thine eyes, and look from the place where thou now
art, to the north, and to Africa, and to the east, and to the
sea; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the
dust of the earth: if any one can number the dust of the earth,
thy seed shall also be numbered. Arise, and walk through
the land, in the length of it, and in the breadth of it; for unto
thee will I give it."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It does not clearly appear whether in
this promise that also is contained by which he is made the
father of all nations. For the clause, "And I will make thy
seed as the dust of the earth," may seem to refer to this, being
spoken by that figure the Greeks call hyperbole, which indeed
is figurative, not literal. But no person of understanding can
doubt in what manner the Scripture uses this and other
figures. For that figure (that is, way of speaking) is used
when what is said is far larger than what is meant by it;
for who does not see how incomparably larger the number of
the dust must be than that of all men can be from Adam
himself down to the end of the world? How much greater,
then, must it be than the seed of Abraham,&mdash;not only that
pertaining to the nation of Israel, but also that which is and
shall be according to the imitation of faith in all nations of the
whole wide world! For that seed is indeed very small in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
comparison with the multitude of the wicked, although even
those few of themselves make an innumerable multitude,
which by a hyperbole is compared to the dust of the earth.
Truly that multitude which was promised to Abraham is not
innumerable to God, although to man; but to God not even
the dust of the earth is so. Further, the promise here made
may be understood not only of the nation of Israel, but of the
whole seed of Abraham, which may be fitly compared to the dust
for multitude, because regarding it also there is the promise<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> of
many children, not according to the flesh, but according to the
spirit. But we have therefore said that this does not clearly
appear, because the multitude even of that one nation, which
was born according to the flesh of Abraham through his
grandson Jacob, has increased so much as to fill almost all
parts of the world. Consequently, even it might by hyperbole
be compared to the dust for multitude, because even it alone
is innumerable by man. Certainly no one questions that only
that land is meant which is called Canaan. But that saying,
"To thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever," may move
some, if by "for ever" they understand "to eternity." But if
in this passage they take "for ever" thus, as we firmly hold
it means, that the beginning of the world to come is to be
ordered from the end of the present, there is still no difficulty,
because, although the Israelites are expelled from Jerusalem,
they still remain in other cities in the land of Canaan, and
shall remain even to the end; and when that whole land is inhabited
by Christians, they also are the very seed of Abraham.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Of Abraham's overcoming the enemies of Sodom, when he delivered Lot
from captivity and was blessed by Melchizedek the priest.</i></p>

<p>Having received this oracle of promise, Abraham migrated,
and remained in another place of the same land, that is,
beside the oak of Mamre, which was Hebron. Then on
the invasion of Sodom, when five kings carried on war
against four, and Lot was taken captive with the conquered
Sodomites, Abraham delivered him from the enemy, leading
with him to battle three hundred and eighteen of his home-born
servants, and won the victory for the kings of Sodom,
but would take nothing of the spoils when offered by the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
for whom he had won them. He was then openly blessed by
Melchizedek, who was priest of God Most High, about whom
many and great things are written in the epistle which is inscribed
to the Hebrews, which most say is by the Apostle
Paul, though some deny this. For then first appeared the
sacrifice which is now offered to God by Christians in the
whole wide world, and that is fulfilled which long after the
event was said by the prophet to Christ, who was yet to come
in the flesh, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek,"<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>&mdash;that is to say, not after the order of Aaron,
for that order was to be taken away when the things shone
forth which were intimated beforehand by these shadows.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Of the word of the Lord to Abraham, by which it was promised to him that
his posterity should be multiplied according to the multitude of the stars;
on believing which he was declared justified while yet in uncircumcision.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision also.
For when God promised him protection and exceeding great
reward, he, being solicitous about posterity, said that a certain
Eliezer of Damascus, born in his house, would be his heir.
Immediately he was promised an heir, not that house-born
servant, but one who was to come forth of Abraham himself;
and again a seed innumerable, not as the dust of the earth,
but as the stars of heaven,&mdash;which rather seems to me a promise
of a posterity exalted in celestial felicity. For, so far as
multitude is concerned, what are the stars of heaven to the
dust of the earth, unless one should say the comparison is like
inasmuch as the stars also cannot be numbered? For it is not
to be believed that all of them can be seen. For the more
keenly one observes them, the more does he see. So that it is
to be supposed some remain concealed from the keenest observers,
to say nothing of those stars which are said to rise and
set in another part of the world most remote from us. Finally,
the authority of this book condemns those like Aratus or
Eudoxus, or any others who boast that they have found out and
written down the complete number of the stars. Here, indeed,
is set down that sentence which the apostle quotes in order to
commend the grace of God, "Abraham believed God, and it
was counted to him for righteousness;"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> lest the circumcision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
should glory, and be unwilling to receive the uncircumcised
nations to the faith of Christ. For at the time when he believed,
and his faith was counted to him for righteousness,
Abraham had not yet been circumcised.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap24"></a>24. <i>Of the meaning of the sacrifice Abraham was commanded to offer when he
supplicated to be taught about those things he had believed.</i></p>

<p>In the same vision, God in speaking to him also says, "I
am God that brought thee out of the region of the Chaldees,
to give thee this land to inherit it."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> And when Abram
asked whereby he might know that he should inherit it, God
said to him, "Take me an heifer of three years old, and a
she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and
a turtle-dove, and a pigeon. And he took unto him all these,
and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against
another; but the birds divided he not. And the fowls came
down," as it is written, "on the carcases, and Abram sat
down by them. But about the going down of the sun, great
fear fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell
upon him. And He said unto Abram, Know of a surety that
thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall
reduce them to servitude; and shall afflict them four hundred
years: but the nation whom they shall serve will I judge;
and afterward shall they come out hither with great substance.
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; kept in a good old
age. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither
again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. And
when the sun was setting, there was a flame, and a smoking
furnace, and lamps of fire, that passed through between those
pieces. In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram,
saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of
Egypt unto the great river Euphrates: the Kenites, and the
Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites,
and the Rephaims, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Hivites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>All these things were said and done in a vision from God;
but it would take long, and would exceed the scope of this
work, to treat of them exactly in detail. It is enough that
we should know that, after it was said Abram believed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, he did not
fail in faith in saying, "Lord God, whereby shall I know
that I shall inherit it?" for the inheritance of that land
was promised to him. Now he does not say, How shall I
know, as if he did not yet believe; but he says, "Whereby
shall I know," meaning that some sign might be given by
which he might know the manner of those things which he
had believed, just as it is not for lack of faith the Virgin
Mary says, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
for she inquired as to the way in which that should take
place which she was certain would come to pass. And when
she asked this, she was told, "The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Here also, in fine, a symbol was given, consisting of
three animals, a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram, and two birds,
a turtle-dove and pigeon, that he might know that the things
which he had not doubted should come to pass were to
happen in accordance with this symbol. Whether, therefore,
the heifer was a sign that the people should be put under the
law, the she-goat that the same people was to become sinful,
the ram that they should reign (and these animals are said to
be of three years old for this reason, that there are three
remarkable divisions of time, from Adam to Noah, and from
him to Abraham, and from him to David, who, on the rejection
of Saul, was first established by the will of the Lord in
the kingdom of the Israelite nation: in this third division,
which extends from Abraham to David, that people grew up
as if passing through the third age of life), or whether they
had some other more suitable meaning, still I have no doubt
whatever that spiritual things were prefigured by them as
well as by the turtle-dove and pigeon. And it is said, "But
the birds divided he not," because carnal men are divided
among themselves, but the spiritual not at all, whether they
seclude themselves from the busy conversation of men, like
the turtle-dove, or dwell among them, like the pigeon; for
both birds are simple and harmless, signifying that even in
the Israelite people, to which that land was to be given, there
would be individuals who were children of the promise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
heirs of the kingdom that is<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> to remain in eternal felicity.
But the fowls coming down on the divided carcases represent
nothing good, but the spirits of this air, seeking some food for
themselves in the division of carnal men. But that Abraham
sat down with them, signifies that even amid these divisions
of the carnal, true believers shall persevere to the end. And
that about the going down of the sun great fear fell upon
Abraham and a horror of great darkness, signifies that about
the end of this world believers shall be in great perturbation
and tribulation, of which the Lord said in the gospel, "For
then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the
beginning."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>But what is said to Abraham, "Know of a surety that thy
seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall
reduce them to servitude, and shall afflict them 400 years,"
is most clearly a prophecy about the people of Israel which
was to be in servitude in Egypt. Not that this people was
to be in that servitude under the oppressive Egyptians for
400 years, but it is foretold that this should take place in
the course of those 400 years. For as it is written of
Terah the father of Abraham, "And the days of Terah in
Haran were 205 years,"<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> not because they were all spent
there, but because they were completed there, so it is
said here also, "And they shall reduce them to servitude,
and shall afflict them 400 years," for this reason, because
that number was completed, not because it was all spent in
that affliction. The years are said to be 400 in round
numbers, although they were a little more,&mdash;whether you
reckon from this time, when these things were promised to
Abraham, or from the birth of Isaac, as the seed of Abraham,
of which these things are predicted. For, as we have already
said above, from the seventy-fifth year of Abraham, when the
first promise was made to him, down to the exodus of Israel
from Egypt, there are reckoned 430 years, which the apostle
thus mentions: "And this I say, that the covenant confirmed
by God, the law, which was made 430 years after, cannot
disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
So then these 430 years might be called 400, because
they are not much more, especially since part even of that
number had already gone by when these things were shown
and said to Abraham in vision, or when Isaac was born in
his father's 100th year, twenty-five years after the first
promise, when of these 430 years there now remained 405,
which God was pleased to call 400. No one will doubt that
the other things which follow in the prophetic words of God
pertain to the people of Israel.</p>

<p>When it is added, "And when the sun was now setting
there was a flame, and lo, a smoking furnace, and lamps of
fire, which passed through between those pieces," this signifies
that at the end of the world the carnal shall be judged by
fire. For just as the affliction of the city of God, such as
never was before, which is expected to take place under Antichrist,
was signified by Abraham's horror of great darkness
about the going down of the sun, that is, when the end of
the world draws nigh,&mdash;so at the going down of the sun, that
is, at the very end of the world, there is signified by that fire
the day of judgment, which separates the carnal who are to
be saved by fire from those who are to be condemned in the
fire. And then the covenant made with Abraham particularly
sets forth the land of Canaan, and names eleven tribes in it
from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates.
It is not then from the great river of Egypt, that is, the Nile,
but from a small one which separates Egypt from Palestine,
where the city of Rhinocorura is.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of Sarah's handmaid, Hagar, whom she herself wished to be Abraham's
concubine.</i></p>

<p>And here follow the times of Abraham's sons, the one by
Hagar the bond maid, the other by Sarah the free woman,
about whom we have already spoken in the previous book.
As regards this transaction, Abraham is in no way to be
branded as guilty concerning this concubine, for he used
her for the begetting of progeny, not for the gratification of
lust; and not to insult, but rather to obey his wife, who supposed
it would be a solace of her barrenness if she could
make use of the fruitful womb of her handmaid to supply
the defect of her own nature, and by that law of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the apostle says, "Likewise also the husband hath not power
of his own body, but the wife,"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> could, as a wife, make use
of him for childbearing by another, when she could not
do so in her own person. Here there is no wanton lust,
no filthy lewdness. The handmaid is delivered to the husband
by the wife for the sake of progeny, and is received
by the husband for the sake of progeny, each seeking, not
guilty excess, but natural fruit. And when the pregnant
bond woman despised her barren mistress, and Sarah, with
womanly jealousy, rather laid the blame of this on her
husband, even then Abraham showed that he was not a
slavish lover, but a free begetter of children, and that in
using Hagar he had guarded the chastity of Sarah his wife,
and had gratified her will and not his own,&mdash;had received her
without seeking, had gone in to her without being attached,
had impregnated without loving her,&mdash;for he says, "Behold
thy maid is in thy hands: do to her as it pleaseth thee;"<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
a man able to use women as a man should,&mdash;his wife temperately,
his handmaid compliantly, neither intemperately!</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>Of God's attestation to Abraham, by which He assures him, when now old,
of a son by the barren Sarah, and appoints him the father of the nations,
and seals his faith in the promise by the sacrament of circumcision.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After these things Ishmael was born of Hagar; and Abraham
might think that in him was fulfilled what God had promised
him, saying, when he wished to adopt his home-born servant,
"This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth
of thee, he shall be thine heir."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Therefore, lest he should
think that what was promised was fulfilled in the handmaid's
son, "when Abram was ninety years old and nine, God
appeared to him, and said unto him, I am God; be well-pleasing
in my sight, and be without complaint, and I will
make my covenant between me and thee, and will fill thee
exceedingly."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Here there are more distinct promises about the calling of
the nations in Isaac, that is, in the son of the promise, by
which grace is signified, and not nature; for the son is promised
from an old man and a barren old woman. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
although God effects even the natural course of procreation,
yet where the agency of God is manifest, through the decay
or failure of nature, grace is more plainly discerned. And
because this was to be brought about, not by generation, but
by regeneration, circumcision was enjoined now, when a son
was promised of Sarah. And by ordering all, not only sons,
but also home-born and purchased servants to be circumcised,
he testifies that this grace pertains to all. For what else does
circumcision signify than a nature renewed on the putting off
of the old? And what else does the eighth day mean than
Christ, who rose again when the week was completed, that is,
after the Sabbath? The very names of the parents are
changed: all things proclaim newness, and the new covenant
is shadowed forth in the old. For what does the term old
covenant imply but the concealing of the new? And what
does the term new covenant imply but the revealing of the
old? The laughter of Abraham is the exultation of one who
rejoices, not the scornful laughter of one who mistrusts. And
those words of his in his heart, "Shall a son be born to me
that am an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety
years old, bear?" are not the words of doubt, but of wonder.
And when it is said, "And I will give to thee, and to thy
seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the
land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession," if it troubles
any one whether this is to be held as fulfilled, or whether its
fulfilment may still be looked for, since no kind of earthly
possession can be everlasting for any nation whatever, let him
know that the word translated everlasting by our writers
is what the Greeks term &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;, which is derived from &#945;&#7984;&#8060;&#957;,
the Greek for <i>sæculum</i>, an age. But the Latins have not
ventured to translate this by <i>secular</i>, lest they should change
the meaning into something widely different. For many
things are called secular which so happen in this world as to
pass away even in a short time; but what is termed &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;
either has no end, or lasts to the very end of this world.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the male, who was to lose his soul if he was not circumcised on the
eighth day, because he had broken God's covenant.</i></p>

<p>When it is said, "The male who is not circumcised in the
flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
because he hath broken my covenant,"<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> some may be troubled
how that ought to be understood, since it can be no fault of
the infant whose life it is said must perish, nor has the
covenant of God been broken by him, but by his parents, who
have not taken care to circumcise him. But even the infants,
not personally in their own life, but according to the common
origin of the human race, have all broken God's covenant in
that one in whom all have sinned.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Now there are many
things called God's covenants besides those two great ones,
the old and the new, which any one who pleases may read
and know. For the first covenant, which was made with the
first man, is just this: "In the day ye eat thereof, ye shall
surely die."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Whence it is written in the book called Ecclesiasticus,
"All flesh waxeth old as doth a garment. For the
covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
Now, as the law was more plainly given afterward, and the
apostle says, "Where no law is, there is no prevarication,"<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
on what supposition is what is said in the psalm true, "I
accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,"<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> except
that all who are held liable for any sin are accused of dealing
deceitfully (prevaricating) with some law? If on this
account, then, even the infants are, according to the true belief,
born in sin, not actual but original, so that we confess
they have need of grace for the remission of sins, certainly it
must be acknowledged that in the same sense in which they
are sinners they are also prevaricators of that law which was
given in Paradise, according to the truth of both scriptures,
"I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators," and
"Where no law is, there is no prevarication." And thus, because
circumcision was the sign of regeneration, and the infant,
on account of the original sin by which God's covenant
was first broken, was not undeservedly to lose his generation
unless delivered by regeneration, these divine words are to be
understood as if it had been said, Whoever is not born again,
that soul shall perish from his people, because he hath broken
my covenant, since he also has sinned in Adam with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
others. For had He said, Because he hath broken this my
covenant, He would have compelled us to understand by it
only this of circumcision; but since He has not expressly said
what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand
Him as speaking of that covenant of which the breach
can be ascribed to an infant. Yet if any one contends that
it is said of nothing else than circumcision, that in it the
infant has broken the covenant of God because he is not circumcised,
he must seek some method of explanation by which
it may be understood without absurdity (such as this) that
he has broken the covenant, because it has been broken in
him although not by him. Yet in this case also it is to be
observed that the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of
neglect against itself, would perish unjustly, unless original
sin rendered it obnoxious to punishment.</p>

<p>28. <i>Of the change of name in Abraham and Sarah, who received the gift of
fecundity when they were incapable of regeneration owing to the barrenness
of one, and the old age of both.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now when a promise so great and clear was made to
Abraham, in which it was so plainly said to him, "I have made
thee a father of many nations, and I will increase thee exceedingly,
and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall
go forth of thee. And I will give thee a son of Sarah; and I
will bless him, and he shall become nations, and kings of
nations shall be of him,"<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>&mdash;a promise which we now see fulfilled
in Christ,&mdash;from that time forward this couple are not
called in Scripture, as formerly, Abram and Sarai, but Abraham
and Sarah, as we have called them from the first, for
every one does so now. The reason why the name of
Abraham was changed is given: "For," He says, "I have
made thee a father of many nations." This, then, is to be
understood to be the meaning of <i>Abraham</i>; but <i>Abram</i>, as he
was formerly called, means "exalted father." The reason of
the change of Sarah's name is not given; but as those say
who have written interpretations of the Hebrew names contained
in these books, Sarah means "my princess," and Sarai
"strength." Whence it is written in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, "Through faith also Sarah herself received strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to conceive seed."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> For both were old, as the Scripture
testifies; but she was also barren, and had ceased to menstruate,
so that she could no longer bear children even if she
had not been barren. Further, if a woman is advanced in
years, yet still retains the custom of women, she can bear
children to a young man, but not to an old man, although that
same old man can beget, but only of a young woman; as
after Sarah's death Abraham could of Keturah, because he
met with her in her lively age. This, then, is what the
apostle mentions as wonderful, saying, besides, that Abraham's
body was now dead;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> because at that age he was no longer
able to beget children of any woman who retained now only
a small part of her natural vigour. Of course we must understand
that his body was dead only to some purposes, not to
all; for if it was so to all, it would no longer be the aged
body of a living man, but the corpse of a dead one. Although
that question, how Abraham begot children of Keturah,
is usually solved in this way, that the gift of begetting which
he received from the Lord, remained even after the death of
his wife, yet I think that solution of the question which I
have followed is preferable, because, although in our days an
old man of a hundred years can beget children of no woman,
it was not so then, when men still lived so long that a hundred
years did not yet bring on them the decrepitude of old age.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the three men or angels, in whom the Lord is related to have appeared
to Abraham at the oak of Mamre.</i></p>

<p>God appeared again to Abraham at the oak of Mamre in
three men, who it is not to be doubted were angels, although
some think that one of them was Christ, and assert that He
was visible before He put on flesh. Now it belongs to the
divine power, and invisible, incorporeal, and incommutable
nature, without changing itself at all, to appear even to mortal
men, not by what it is, but by what is subject to it. And
what is not subject to it? Yet if they try to establish that
one of these three was Christ by the fact that, although he
saw three, he addressed the Lord in the singular, as it is
written, "And, lo, three men stood by him: and, when he
saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent-door, and worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
toward the ground, and said, Lord, if I have found
favour before thee,"<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> etc.; why do they not advert to this
also, that when two of them came to destroy the Sodomites,
while Abraham still spoke to one, calling him Lord, and interceding
that he would not destroy the righteous along with
the wicked in Sodom, Lot received these two in such a way
that he too in his conversation with them addressed the Lord
in the singular? For after saying to them in the plural,
"Behold, my lords, turn aside into your servant's house,"<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> etc.,
yet it is afterwards said, "And the angels laid hold upon his
hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two
daughters, because the Lord was merciful unto him. And it
came to pass, whenever they had led him forth abroad, that
they said, Save thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all this region: save thyself in the mountain, lest
thou be caught. And Lot said unto them, I pray thee, Lord,
since thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> etc. And
then after these words the Lord also answered him in the
singular, although He was in two angels, saying, "See, I have
accepted thy face,"<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> etc. This makes it much more credible that
both Abraham in the three men and Lot in the two recognised
the Lord, addressing Him in the singular number, even when
they were addressing men; for they received them as they did
for no other reason than that they might minister human refection
to them as men who needed it. Yet there was about them
something so excellent, that those who showed them hospitality
as men could not doubt that God was in them as He
was wont to be in the prophets, and therefore sometimes
addressed them in the plural, and sometimes God in them in
the singular. But that they were angels the Scripture
testifies, not only in this book of Genesis, in which these
transactions are related, but also in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
where in praising hospitality it is said, "For thereby some
have entertained angels unawares."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> By these three men,
then, when a son Isaac was again promised to Abraham by
Sarah, such a divine oracle was also given that it was said,
"Abraham shall become a great and numerous nation, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> And here
these two things are promised with the utmost brevity and
fulness,&mdash;the nation of Israel according to the flesh, and all
nations according to faith.</p>


<p class="center">30. <i>Of Lot's deliverance from Sodom, and its consumption by fire from heaven;
and of Abimelech, whose lust could not harm Sarah's chastity.</i></p>

<p>After this promise Lot was delivered out of Sodom, and a
fiery rain from heaven turned into ashes that whole region of
the impious city, where custom had made sodomy as prevalent
as laws have elsewhere made other kinds of wickedness. But
this punishment of theirs was a specimen of the divine judgment
to come. For what is meant by the angels forbidding
those who were delivered to look back, but that we are not
to look back in heart to the old life which, being regenerated
through grace, we have put off, if we think to escape the last
judgment? Lot's wife, indeed, when she looked back, remained,
and, being turned into salt, furnished to believing
men a condiment by which to savour somewhat the warning
to be drawn from that example. Then Abraham did again
at Gerar, with Abimelech the king of that city, what he had
done in Egypt about his wife, and received her back untouched
in the same way. On this occasion, when the king
rebuked Abraham for not saying she was his wife, and calling
her his sister, he explained what he had been afraid of, and
added this further, "And yet indeed she is my sister by the
father's side, but not by the mother's;"<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> for she was Abraham's
sister by his own father, and so near of kin. But her beauty
was so great, that even at that advanced age she could be
fallen in love with.</p>


<p class="center">31. <i>Of Isaac, who was born according to the promise, whose name was given on
account of the laughter of both parents.</i></p>

<p>After these things a son was born to Abraham, according
to God's promise, of Sarah, and was called Isaac, which means
<i>laughter</i>. For his father had laughed when he was promised
to him, in wondering delight, and his mother, when he was
again promised by those three men, had laughed, doubting for
joy; yet she was blamed by the angel because that laughter,
although it was for joy, yet was not full of faith. Afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
she was confirmed in faith by the same angel. From this,
then, the boy got his name. For when Isaac was born and
called by that name, Sarah showed that her laughter was not
that of scornful reproach, but that of joyful praise; for she
said, "God hath made me to laugh, so that every one who
hears will laugh with me."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Then in a little while the
bond maid was cast out of the house with her son; and, according
to the apostle, these two women signify the old and new
covenants,&mdash;Sarah representing that of the Jerusalem which is
above, that is, the city of God.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>


<p class="center">32. <i>Of Abraham's obedience and faith, which were proved by the offering up of
his son in sacrifice; and of Sarah's death.</i></p>

<p>Among other things, of which it would take too long time
to mention the whole, Abraham was tempted about the offering
up of his well-beloved son Isaac, to prove his pious obedience,
and so make it known to the world, not to God. Now
every temptation is not blameworthy; it may even be praiseworthy,
because it furnishes probation. And, for the most
part, the human mind cannot attain to self-knowledge otherwise
than by making trial of its powers through temptation,
by some kind of experimental and not merely verbal self-interrogation;
when, if it has acknowledged the gift of God, it
is pious, and is consolidated by stedfast grace and not puffed
up by vain boasting. Of course Abraham could never believe
that God delighted in human sacrifices; yet when the divine
commandment thundered, it was to be obeyed, not disputed.
Yet Abraham is worthy of praise, because he all along
believed that his son, on being offered up, would rise again;
for God had said to him, when he was unwilling to fulfil his
wife's pleasure by casting out the bond maid and her son, "In
Isaac shall thy seed be called." No doubt He then goes on
to say, "And as for the son of this bond woman, I will make
him a great nation, because he is thy seed."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> How then is
it said, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," when God calls
Ishmael also his seed? The apostle, in explaining this, says,
"In Isaac shall thy seed be called, that is, they which are the
children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the children of the promise are counted for the seed."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> In
order, then, that the children of the promise may be the seed
of Abraham, they are called in Isaac, that is, are gathered
together in Christ by the call of grace. Therefore the father,
holding fast from the first the promise which behoved to be
fulfilled through this son whom God had ordered him to slay,
did not doubt that he whom he once thought it hopeless he
should ever receive would be restored to him when he had
offered him up. It is in this way the passage in the Epistle
to the Hebrews is also to be understood and explained. "By
faith," he says, "Abraham overcame, when tempted about
Isaac: and he who had received the promise offered up his
only son, to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be
called: thinking that God was able to raise him up, even
from the dead;" therefore he has added, "from whence also
he received him in a similitude."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In whose similitude but
His of whom the apostle says, "He that spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all?"<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> And on this
account Isaac also himself carried to the place of sacrifice the
wood on which he was to be offered up, just as the Lord
Himself carried His own cross. Finally, since Isaac was not
to be slain, after his father was forbidden to smite him, who
was that ram by the offering of which that sacrifice was completed
with typical blood? For when Abraham saw him, he
was caught by the horns in a thicket. What, then, did he
represent but Jesus, who, before He was offered up, was
crowned with thorns by the Jews?</p>

<p>But let us rather hear the divine words spoken through
the angel. For the Scripture says, "And Abraham stretched
forth his hand to take the knife, that he might slay his son.
And the Angel of the Lord called unto him from heaven, and
said, Abraham. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay
not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto
him: for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not
spared thy beloved son for my sake."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> It is said, "Now I
know," that is, Now I have made to be known; for God was not
previously ignorant of this. Then, having offered up that ram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
instead of Isaac his son, "Abraham," as we read, "called the
name of that place The Lord seeth: as they say this day, In
the mount the Lord hath appeared."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> As it is said, "Now I
know," for Now I have made to be known, so here, "The
Lord sees," for The Lord hath appeared, that is, made Himself
to be seen. "And the Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham
from heaven the second time, saying, By myself have I sworn,
saith the Lord; because thou hast done this thing, and hast
not spared thy beloved son for my sake; that in blessing I
will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore;
and thy seed shall possess by inheritance the cities of
the adversaries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In
this manner is that promise concerning the calling of the
nations in the seed of Abraham confirmed even by the oath
of God, after that burnt-offering which typified Christ. For
He had often promised, but never sworn. And what is the
oath of God, the true and faithful, but a confirmation of the
promise, and a certain reproof to the unbelieving?</p>

<p>After these things Sarah died, in the 127th year of her life,
and the 137th of her husband; for he was ten years older
than she, as he himself says, when a son is promised to him
by her: "Shall a son be born to me that am an hundred years
old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Then
Abraham bought a field, in which he buried his wife. And
then, according to Stephen's account, he was settled in that
land, entering then on actual possession of it,&mdash;that is, after
the death of his father, who is inferred to have died two years
before.</p>


<p class="center">33. <i>Of Rebecca, the grand-daughter of Nahor, whom Isaac took to wife.</i></p>

<p>Isaac married Rebecca, the grand-daughter of Nahor, his
father's brother, when he was forty years old, that is, in the
140th year of his father's life, three years after his mother's
death. Now when a servant was sent to Mesopotamia by his
father to fetch her, and when Abraham said to that servant,
"Put thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear
by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the Lord of the earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son Isaac of the
daughters of the Canaanites,"<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> what else was pointed out by
this, but that the Lord, the God of heaven, and the Lord of
the earth, was to come in the flesh which was to be derived
from that thigh? Are these small tokens of the foretold
truth which we see fulfilled in Christ?</p>


<p class="center">34. <i>What is meant by Abraham's marrying Keturah after Sarah's death.</i></p>

<p>What did Abraham mean by marrying Keturah after
Sarah's death? Far be it from us to suspect him of incontinence,
especially when he had reached such an age and such
sanctity of faith. Or was he still seeking to beget children,
though he held fast, with most approved faith, the promise
of God that his children should be multiplied out of Isaac as
the stars of heaven and the dust of the earth? And yet, if
Hagar and Ishmael, as the apostle teaches us, signified the
carnal people of the old covenant, why may not Keturah and
her sons also signify the carnal people who think they belong
to the new covenant? For both are called both the wives
and the concubines of Abraham; but Sarah is never called a
concubine (but only a wife). For when Hagar is given to
Abraham, it is written, "And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar
the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years
in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram
to be his wife."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> And of Keturah, whom he took after
Sarah's departure, we read, "Then again Abraham took a
wife, whose name was Keturah."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Lo, both are called wives,
yet both are found to have been concubines; for the Scripture
afterward says, "And Abraham gave his whole estate
unto Isaac his son. But unto the sons of his concubines
Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from his son Isaac,
(while he yet lived,) eastward, unto the east country."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Therefore
the sons of the concubines, that is, the heretics and the
carnal Jews, have some gifts, but do not attain the promised
kingdom; "For they which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God: but the children of the promise
are counted for the seed, of whom it was said, In Isaac shall
thy seed be called."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> For I do not see why Keturah, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
was married after the wife's death, should be called a concubine,
except on account of this mystery. But if any one is
unwilling to put such meanings on these things, he need not
calumniate Abraham. For what if even this was provided
against the heretics who were to be the opponents of second
marriages, so that it might be shown that it was no sin in the
case of the father of many nations himself, when, after his
wife's death, he married again? And Abraham died when
he was 175 years old, so that he left his son Isaac seventy-five
years old, having begotten him when 100 years old.</p>


<p class="center">35. <i>What was indicated by the divine answer about the twins still shut up in the
womb of Rebecca their mother.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see how the times of the city of God run on
from this point among Abraham's descendants. In the time
from the first year of Isaac's life to the seventieth, when his
sons were born, the only memorable thing is, that when he
prayed God that his wife, who was barren, might bear, and
the Lord granted what he sought, and she conceived, the
twins leapt while still enclosed in her womb. And when she
was troubled by this struggle, and inquired of the Lord, she
received this answer: "Two nations are in thy womb, and two
manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the
one people shall overcome the other people, and the elder
shall serve the younger."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The Apostle Paul would have us
understand this as a great instance of grace;<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> for the children
being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, the
younger is chosen without any good desert, and the elder is
rejected, when beyond doubt, as regards original sin, both
were alike, and as regards actual sin, neither had any. But
the plan of the work on hand does not permit me to speak
more fully of this matter now, and I have said much about it
in other works. Only that saying, "The elder shall serve the
younger," is understood by our writers, almost without exception,
to mean that the elder people, the Jews, shall serve the
younger people, the Christians. And truly, although this
might seem to be fulfilled in the Idumean nation, which was
born of the elder (who had two names, being called both Esau
and Edom, whence the name Idumeans), because it was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to be overcome by the people which sprang from the
younger, that is, by the Israelites, and was to become subject
to them; yet it is more suitable to believe that, when it
was said, "The one people shall overcome the other people,
and the elder shall serve the younger," that prophecy meant
some greater thing; and what is that except what is evidently
fulfilled in the Jews and Christians?</p>


<p class="center">36. <i>Of the oracle and blessing which Isaac received, just as his father did, being
beloved for his sake.</i></p>

<p>Isaac also received such an oracle as his father had often
received. Of this oracle it is thus written: "And there was
a famine over the land, beside the first famine that was in
the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
king of the Philistines unto Gerar. And the Lord appeared
unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; but dwell in
the land which I shall tell thee of. And abide in this land,
and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: unto thee and
unto thy seed I will give all this land; and I will establish
mine oath, which I sware unto Abraham thy father: and I
will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give
unto thy seed all this land: and in thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed; because that Abraham thy
father obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts, my commandments,
my righteousness, and my laws."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This patriarch
neither had another wife, nor any concubine, but was content
with the twin-children begotten by one act of generation.
He also was afraid, when he lived among strangers, of being
brought into danger owing to the beauty of his wife, and did
like his father in calling her his sister, and not telling that
she was his wife; for she was his near blood-relation by the
father's and mother's side. She also remained untouched by
the strangers, when it was known she was his wife. Yet we
ought not to prefer him to his father because he knew no
woman besides his one wife. For beyond doubt the merits
of his father's faith and obedience were greater, inasmuch as
God says it is for his sake He does Isaac good: "In thy seed,"
He says, "shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because
that Abraham thy father obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." And
again in another oracle He says, "I am the God of Abraham
thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee,
and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> So
that we must understand how chastely Abraham acted, because
imprudent men, who seek some support for their own
wickedness in the Holy Scriptures, think he acted through
lust. We may also learn this, not to compare men by single
good things, but to consider everything in each; for it may
happen that one man has something in his life and character
in which he excels another, and it may be far more excellent
than that in which the other excels him. And thus, according
to sound and true judgment, while continence is preferable
to marriage, yet a believing married man is better than
a continent unbeliever; for the unbeliever is not only less
praiseworthy, but is even highly detestable. We must conclude,
then, that both are good; yet so as to hold that the
married man who is most faithful and most obedient is certainly
better than the continent man whose faith and obedience
are less. But if equal in other things, who would hesitate to
prefer the continent man to the married?</p>


<p class="center">37. <i>Of the things mystically prefigured in Esau and Jacob.</i></p>

<p>Isaac's two sons, Esau and Jacob, grew up together. The
primacy of the elder was transferred to the younger by a
bargain and agreement between them, when the elder immoderately
lusted after the lentiles the younger had prepared
for food, and for that price sold his birthright to him,
confirming it with an oath. We learn from this that a person
is to be blamed, not for the kind of food he eats, but for
immoderate greed. Isaac grew old, and old age deprived him
of his eyesight. He wished to bless the elder son, and
instead of the elder, who was hairy, unwittingly blessed the
younger, who put himself under his father's hands, having
covered himself with kid-skins, as if bearing the sins of others.
Lest we should think this guile of Jacob's was fraudulent
guile, instead of seeking in it the mystery of a great thing,
the Scripture has predicted in the words just before, "Esau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a
simple man, dwelling at home."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Some of our writers have
interpreted this, "without guile." But whether the Greek
&#7940;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; means "without guile," or "simple," or rather
"without feigning," in the receiving of that blessing what is
the guile of the man without guile? What is the guile of
the simple, what the fiction of the man who does not lie, but
a profound mystery of the truth? But what is the blessing
itself? "See," he says, "the smell of my son is as the smell
of a full field which the Lord hath blessed: therefore God
give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fruitfulness of the
earth, and plenty of corn and wine: let nations serve thee,
and princes adore thee: and be lord of thy brethren, and let thy
father's sons adore thee: cursed be he that curseth thee, and
blessed be he that blesseth thee."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The blessing of Jacob is
therefore a proclamation of Christ to all nations. It is this
which has come to pass, and is now being fulfilled. Isaac is
the law and the prophecy: even by the mouth of the Jews
Christ is blessed by prophecy as by one who knows not, because
it is itself not understood. The world like a field is filled
with the odour of Christ's name: His is the blessing of the dew
of heaven, that is, of the showers of divine words; and of
the fruitfulness of the earth, that is, of the gathering together
of the peoples: His is the plenty of corn and wine, that is,
the multitude that gathers bread and wine in the sacrament of
His body and blood. Him the nations serve, Him princes
adore. He is the Lord of His brethren, because His people
rules over the Jews. Him His Father's sons adore, that is,
the sons of Abraham according to faith; for He Himself is
the son of Abraham according to the flesh. He is cursed
that curseth Him, and he that blesseth Him is blessed.
Christ, I say, who is ours is blessed, that is, truly spoken of out
of the mouths of the Jews, when, although erring, they yet
sing the law and the prophets, and think they are blessing
another for whom they erringly hope. So, when the elder
son claims the promised blessing, Isaac is greatly afraid, and
wonders when he knows that he has blessed one instead of the
other, and demands who he is; yet he does not complain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
he has been deceived, yea, when the great mystery is revealed
to him, in his secret heart he at once eschews anger,
and confirms the blessing. "Who then," he says, "hath
hunted me venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of
all before thou camest, and have blessed him, and he shall be
blessed?"<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Who would not rather have expected the curse
of an angry man here, if these things had been done in an
earthly manner, and not by inspiration from above? O
things done, yet done prophetically; on the earth, yet celestially;
by men, yet divinely! If everything that is fertile of
so great mysteries should be examined carefully, many volumes
would be filled; but the moderate compass fixed for this work
compels us to hasten to other things.</p>

<p>38. <i>Of Jacob's mission to Mesopotamia to get a wife, and of the vision which he
saw in a dream by the way, and of his getting four women when he
sought one wife.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Jacob was sent by his parents to Mesopotamia that he
might take a wife there. These were his father's words on
sending him: "Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters
of the Canaanites. Arise, fly to Mesopotamia, to the house of
Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence
of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. And my
God bless thee, and increase thee, and multiply thee; and
thou shalt be an assembly of peoples; and give to thee the
blessing of Abraham thy father, and to thy seed after thee;
that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou dwellest,
which God gave unto Abraham."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Now we understand here
that the seed of Jacob is separated from Isaac's other seed
which came through Esau. For when it is said, "In Isaac
shall thy seed be called,"<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> by this seed is meant solely the
city of God; so that from it is separated Abraham's other
seed, which was in the son of the bond woman, and which was
to be in the sons of Keturah. But until now it had been
uncertain regarding Isaac's twin-sons whether that blessing
belonged to both or only to one of them; and if to one,
which of them it was. This is now declared when Jacob is
prophetically blessed by his father, and it is said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
"And thou shalt be an assembly of peoples, and God give to
thee the blessing of Abraham thy father."</p>

<p>When Jacob was going to Mesopotamia, he received in a
dream an oracle, of which it is thus written: "And Jacob went
out from the well of the oath,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and went to Haran. And he came
to a place, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he took of
the stones of the place, and put them at his head, and slept in
that place, and dreamed. And behold a ladder set up on the
earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and the angels of
God ascended and descended by it. And the Lord stood
above it, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father, and
the God of Isaac; fear not: the land whereon thou sleepest,
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be
as the dust of the earth; and it shall be spread abroad to the
sea, and to Africa, and to the north, and to the east: and all
the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in thee and in thy
seed. And, behold, I am with thee, to keep thee in all thy
way wherever thou goest, and I will bring thee back into
this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done all
which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awoke out of
his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I
knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is
this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this
is the gate of heaven. And Jacob arose, and took the stone
that he had put under his head there, and set it up for a
memorial, and poured oil upon the top of it. And Jacob
called the name of that place the house of God."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This is
prophetic. For Jacob did not pour oil on the stone in an
idolatrous way, as if making it a god; neither did he adore
that stone, or sacrifice to it. But since the name of Christ
comes from the chrism or anointing, something pertaining to
the great mystery was certainly represented in this. And
the Saviour Himself is understood to bring this latter to
remembrance in the gospel, when He says of Nathanael,
"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> because
Israel who saw this vision is no other than Jacob. And in
the same place He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man."</p>

<p>Jacob went on to Mesopotamia to take a wife from thence.
And the divine Scripture points out how, without unlawfully
desiring any of them, he came to have four women, of
whom he begat twelve sons and one daughter; for he had
come to take only one. But when one was falsely given him
in place of the other, he did not send her away after unwittingly
using her in the night, lest he should seem to have
put her to shame; but as at that time, in order to multiply
posterity, no law forbade a plurality of wives, he took her also
to whom alone he had promised marriage. As she was barren,
she gave her handmaid to her husband that she might have
children by her; and her elder sister did the same thing in
imitation of her, although she had borne, because she desired
to multiply progeny. We do not read that Jacob sought any
but one, or that he used many, except for the purpose of begetting
offspring, saving conjugal rights; and he would not
have done this, had not his wives, who had legitimate power
over their own husband's body, urged him to do it. So he
begat twelve sons and one daughter by four women. Then
he entered into Egypt by his son Joseph, who was sold by his
brethren for envy, and carried there, and who was there exalted.</p>


<p class="center">39. <i>The reason why Jacob was also called Israel.</i></p>

<p>As I said a little ago, Jacob was also called Israel, the
name which was most prevalent among the people descended
from him. Now this name was given him by the angel
who wrestled with him on the way back from Mesopotamia,
and who was most evidently a type of Christ. For when
Jacob overcame him, doubtless with his own consent, that the
mystery might be represented, it signified Christ's passion, in
which the Jews are seen overcoming Him. And yet he
besought a blessing from the very angel he had overcome; and
so the imposition of this name was the blessing. For Israel
means <i>seeing God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> which will at last be the reward of all the
saints. The angel also touched him on the breadth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
thigh when he was overcoming him, and in that way made
him lame. So that Jacob was at one and the same time
blessed and lame: blessed in those among that people who
believed in Christ, and lame in the unbelieving. For the
breadth of the thigh is the multitude of the family. For there
are many of that race of whom it was prophetically said beforehand,
"And they have halted in their paths."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>


<p class="center">40. <i>How it is said that Jacob went into Egypt with seventy-five souls, when most
of those who are mentioned were born at a later period.</i></p>

<p>Seventy-five men are reported to have entered Egypt along
with Jacob, counting him with his children. In this number
only two women are mentioned, one a daughter, the other a
grand-daughter. But when the thing is carefully considered,
it does not appear that Jacob's offspring was so numerous on the
day or year when he entered Egypt. There are also included
among them the great-grandchildren of Joseph, who could not
possibly be born already. For Jacob was then 130 years old,
and his son Joseph thirty-nine; and as it is plain that he
took a wife when he was thirty or more, how could he in nine
years have great-grandchildren by the children whom he had
by that wife? Now, since Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons
of Joseph, could not even have children, for Jacob found them
boys under nine years old when he entered Egypt, in what
way are not only their sons but their grandsons reckoned
among those seventy-five who then entered Egypt with Jacob?
For there is reckoned there Machir the son of Manasseh, grandson
of Joseph, and Machir's son, that is, Gilead, grandson of
Manasseh, great-grandson of Joseph; there, too, is he whom
Ephraim, Joseph's other son, begot, that is, Shuthelah, grandson
of Joseph, and Shuthelah's son Ezer, grandson of Ephraim,
and great-grandson of Joseph, who could not possibly be in
existence when Jacob came into Egypt, and there found his
grandsons, the sons of Joseph, their grandsires, still boys under
nine years of age.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> But doubtless, when the Scripture mentions
Jacob's entrance into Egypt with seventy-five souls, it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
not mean one day, or one year, but that whole time as long as
Joseph lived, who was the cause of his entrance. For the
same Scripture speaks thus of Joseph: "And Joseph dwelt
in Egypt, he and his brethren, and all his father's house: and
Joseph lived 110 years, and saw Ephraim's children of the
third generation."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> That is, his great-grandson, the third from
Ephraim; for the third generation means son, grandson, great-grandson.
Then it is added, "The children also of Machir,
the son of Manasseh, were born upon Joseph's knees."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> And
this is that grandson of Manasseh, and great-grandson of
Joseph. But the plural number is employed according to
scriptural usage; for the one daughter of Jacob is spoken of
as daughters, just as in the usage of the Latin tongue <i>liberi</i> is
used in the plural for children even when there is only one.
Now, when Joseph's own happiness is proclaimed, because he
could see his great-grandchildren, it is by no means to be
thought they already existed in the thirty-ninth year of their
great-grandsire Joseph, when his father Jacob came to him in
Egypt. But those who diligently look into these things will
the less easily be mistaken, because it is written, "These are
the names of the sons of Israel who entered into Egypt along
with Jacob their father."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> For this means that the seventy-five
are reckoned along with him, not that they were all with
him when he entered Egypt; for, as I have said, the whole
period during which Joseph, who occasioned his entrance, lived,
is held to be the time of that entrance.</p>


<p class="center">41. <i>Of the blessing which Jacob promised in Judah his son.</i></p>

<p>If, on account of the Christian people in whom the city of
God sojourns in the earth, we look for the flesh of Christ in
the seed of Abraham, setting aside the sons of the concubines,
we have Isaac; if in the seed of Isaac, setting aside Esau,
who is also Edom, we have Jacob, who also is Israel; if in
the seed of Israel himself, setting aside the rest, we have
Judah, because Christ sprang of the tribe of Judah. Let us
hear, then, how Israel, when dying in Egypt, in blessing his
sons, prophetically blessed Judah. He says: "Judah, thy
brethren shall praise thee: thy hands shall be on the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
thine enemies; thy father's children shall adore thee. Judah
is a lion's whelp: from the sprouting, my son, thou art gone
up: lying down, thou hast slept as a lion, and as a lion's
whelp; who shall awake him? A prince shall not be
lacking out of Judah, and a leader from his thighs, until the
things come that are laid up for him; and He shall be the
expectation of the nations. Binding his foal unto the vine,
and his ass's foal to the choice vine; he shall wash his robe
in wine, and his clothes in the blood of the grape: his eyes
are red with wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk."<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> I
have expounded these words in disputing against Faustus the
Manichæan; and I think it is enough to make the truth of
this prophecy shine, to remark that the death of Christ is predicted
by the word about his lying down, and not the necessity,
but the voluntary character of His death, in the title of
lion. That power He Himself proclaims in the gospel, saying,
"I have the power of laying down my life, and I have the
power of taking it again. No man taketh it from me; but I
lay it down of myself, and take it again."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> So the lion roared,
so He fulfilled what He said. For to this power what is added
about the resurrection refers, "Who shall awake him?" This
means that no man but Himself has raised Him, who also
said of His own body, "Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> And the very nature of His death,
that is, the height of the cross, is understood by the single
word, "Thou art gone up." The evangelist explains what is
added, "Lying down, thou hast slept," when he says, "He
bowed His head, and gave up the ghost."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Or at least His
burial is to be understood, in which He lay down sleeping,
and whence no man raised Him, as the prophets did some,
and as He Himself did others; but He Himself rose up as if
from sleep. As for His robe which He washes in wine, that
is, cleanses from sin in His own blood, of which blood those
who are baptized know the mystery, so that he adds, "And
his clothes in the blood of the grape," what is it but the
Church? "And his eyes are red with wine," [these are] His
spiritual people drunken with His cup, of which the psalm
sings, "And thy cup that makes drunken, how excellent it is!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
"And his teeth are whiter than milk,"<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>&mdash;that is, the nutritive
words which, according to the apostle, the babes drink, being
as yet unfit for solid food.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> And it is He in whom the promises
of Judah were laid up, so that until they come, princes,
that is, the kings of Israel, shall never be lacking out of Judah.
"And He is the expectation of the nations." This is too plain
to need exposition.</p>


<p class="center">42. <i>Of the sons of Joseph, whom Jacob blessed, prophetically changing his hands.</i></p>

<p>Now, as Isaac's two sons, Esau and Jacob, furnished a type
of the two people, the Jews and the Christians (although
as pertains to carnal descent it was not the Jews but the
Idumeans who came of the seed of Esau, nor the Christian
nations but rather the Jews who came of Jacob's; for the type
holds only as regards the saying, "The elder shall serve the
younger"<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>), so the same thing happened in Joseph's two sons;
for the elder was a type of the Jews, and the younger of the
Christians. For when Jacob was blessing them, and laid his
right hand on the younger, who was at his left, and his left
hand on the elder, who was at his right, this seemed wrong to
their father, and he admonished his father by trying to correct
his mistake and show him which was the elder. But he
would not change his hands, but said, "I know, my son, I
know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be
exalted; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
his seed shall become a multitude of nations."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> And these
two promises show the same thing. For that one is to become
"a people;" this one "a multitude of nations." And what can
be more evident than that these two promises comprehend the
people of Israel, and the whole world of Abraham's seed, the
one according to the flesh, the other according to faith?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>43. <i>Of the times of Moses and Joshua the son of Nun, of the judges, and thereafter
of the kings, of whom Saul was the first, but David is to be regarded
as the chief, both by the oath and by merit.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Jacob being dead, and Joseph also, during the remaining
144 years until they went out of the land of Egypt that
nation increased to an incredible degree, even although wasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
by so great persecutions, that at one time the male children
were murdered at their birth, because the wondering Egyptians
were terrified at the too great increase of that people. Then
Moses, being stealthily kept from the murderers of the infants,
was brought to the royal house, God preparing to do great
things by him, and was nursed and adopted by the daughter
of Pharaoh (that was the name of all the kings of Egypt), and
became so great a man that he&mdash;yea, rather God, who had promised
this to Abraham, by him&mdash;drew that nation, so wonderfully
multiplied, out of the yoke of hardest and most grievous
servitude it had borne there. At first, indeed, he fled thence
(we are told he fled into the land of Midian), because, in
defending an Israelite, he had slain an Egyptian, and was
afraid. Afterward, being divinely commissioned in the power
of the Spirit of God, he overcame the magi of Pharaoh who
resisted him. Then, when the Egyptians would not let God's
people go, ten memorable plagues were brought by Him upon
them,&mdash;the water turned into blood, the frogs and lice, the flies,
the death of the cattle, the boils, the hail, the locusts, the
darkness, the death of the first-born. At last the Egyptians
were destroyed in the Red Sea while pursuing the Israelites,
whom they had let go when at length they were broken by
so many great plagues. The divided sea made a way for the
Israelites who were departing, but, returning on itself, it overwhelmed
their pursuers with its waves. Then for forty years
the people of God went through the desert, under the leadership
of Moses, when the tabernacle of testimony was dedicated,
in which God was worshipped by sacrifices prophetic of things
to come, and that was after the law had been very terribly
given in the mount, for its divinity was most plainly attested
by wonderful signs and voices. This took place soon after the
exodus from Egypt, when the people had entered the desert,
on the fiftieth day after the passover was celebrated by the
offering up of a lamb, which is so completely a type of Christ,
foretelling that through His sacrificial passion He should go
from this world to the Father (for <i>pascha</i> in the Hebrew
tongue means <i>transit</i>), that when the new covenant was
revealed, after Christ our passover was offered up, the Holy
Spirit came from heaven on the fiftieth day; and He is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in the gospel the Finger of God, because He recalls to our
remembrance the things done before by way of types, and
because the tables of that law are said to have been written
by the finger of God.</p>

<p>On the death of Moses, Joshua the son of Nun ruled the
people, and led them into the land of promise, and divided it
among them. By these two wonderful leaders wars were also
carried on most prosperously and wonderfully, God calling to
witness that they had got these victories not so much on
account of the merit of the Hebrew people as on account of
the sins of the nations they subdued. After these leaders
there were judges, when the people were settled in the land of
promise, so that, in the meantime, the first promise made to
Abraham began to be fulfilled about the one nation, that is,
the Hebrew, and about the land of Canaan; but not as yet
the promise about all nations, and the whole wide world, for
that was to be fulfilled, not by the observances of the old law,
but by the advent of Christ in the flesh, and by the faith of the
gospel. And it was to prefigure this that it was not Moses,
who received the law for the people on Mount Sinai, that led
the people into the land of promise, but Joshua, whose name
also was changed at God's command, so that he was called
Jesus. But in the times of the judges prosperity alternated
with adversity in war, according as the sins of the people and
the mercy of God were displayed.</p>

<p>We come next to the times of the kings. The first who
reigned was Saul; and when he was rejected and laid low in
battle, and his offspring rejected so that no kings should arise
out of it, David succeeded to the kingdom, whose son Christ
is chiefly called. He was made a kind of starting-point and
beginning of the advanced youth of God's people, who had
passed a kind of age of puberty from Abraham to this David.
And it is not in vain that the evangelist Matthew records the
generations in such a way as to sum up this first period from
Abraham to David in fourteen generations. For from the age
of puberty man begins to be capable of generation; therefore
he starts the list of generations from Abraham, who also was
made the father of many nations when he got his name
changed. So that previously this family of God's people was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in its childhood, from Noah to Abraham; and for that reason
the first language was then learned, that is, the Hebrew. For
man begins to speak in childhood, the age succeeding infancy,
which is so termed because then he cannot speak.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> And
that first age is quite drowned in oblivion, just as the first age
of the human race was blotted out by the flood; for who is
there that can remember his infancy? Wherefore in this
progress of the city of God, as the previous book contained
that first age, so this one ought to contain the second and
third ages, in which third age, as was shown by the heifer of
three years old, the she-goat of three years old, and the ram
of three years old, the yoke of the law was imposed, and there
appeared abundance of sins, and the beginning of the earthly
kingdom arose, in which there were not lacking spiritual men,
of whom the turtle-dove and pigeon represented the mystery.</p>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>IN THIS BOOK THE HISTORY OF THE CITY OF GOD IS TRACED DURING THE PERIOD
OF THE KINGS AND PROPHETS FROM SAMUEL TO DAVID, EVEN TO CHRIST;
AND THE PROPHECIES WHICH ARE RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF KINGS,
PSALMS, AND THOSE OF SOLOMON, ARE INTERPRETED OF CHRIST AND THE
CHURCH.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of the prophetic age.</i></p>

<p>By the favour of God we have treated distinctly of His
promises made to Abraham, that both the nation of
Israel according to the flesh, and all nations according to faith,
should be his seed, and the City of God, proceeding according
to the order of time, will point<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> out how they were fulfilled.
Having therefore in the previous book come down to the reign
of David, we shall now treat of what remains, so far as may
seem sufficient for the object of this work, beginning at the
same reign. Now, from the time when holy Samuel began to
prophesy, and ever onward until the people of Israel was led
captive into Babylonia, and until, according to the prophecy
of holy Jeremiah, on Israel's return thence after seventy years,
the house of God was built anew, this whole period is the
prophetic age. For although both the patriarch Noah himself,
in whose days the whole earth was destroyed by the
flood, and others before and after him down to this time when
there began to be kings over the people of God, may not undeservedly
be styled prophets, on account of certain things
pertaining to the city of God and the kingdom of heaven,
which they either predicted or in any way signified should
come to pass, and especially since we read that some of them,
as Abraham and Moses, were expressly so styled, yet those
are most and chiefly called the days of the prophets from the
time when Samuel began to prophesy, who at God's command
first anointed Saul to be king, and, on his rejection, David
himself, whom others of his issue should succeed as long as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
was fitting they should do so. If, therefore, I wished to rehearse
all that the prophets have predicted concerning Christ,
while the city of God, with its members dying and being born
in constant succession, ran its course through those times, this
work would extend beyond all bounds. First, because the
Scripture itself, even when, in treating in order of the kings
and of their deeds and the events of their reigns, it seems to
be occupied in narrating as with historical diligence the affairs
transacted, will be found, if the things handled by it are considered
with the aid of the Spirit of God, either more, or
certainly not less, intent on foretelling things to come than on
relating things past. And who that thinks even a little about
it does not know how laborious and prolix a work it would be,
and how many volumes it would require to search this out by
thorough investigation and demonstrate it by argument? And
then, because of that which without dispute pertains to prophecy,
there are so many things concerning Christ and the
kingdom of heaven, which is the city of God, that to explain
these a larger discussion would be necessary than the due proportion
of this work admits of. Therefore I shall, if I can, so
limit myself, that in carrying through this work, I may, with
God's help, neither say what is superfluous nor omit what is
necessary.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>At what time the promise of God was fulfilled concerning the land of Canaan,
which even carnal Israel got in possession.</i></p>

<p>In the preceding book we said, that in the promise of God
to Abraham two things were promised from the beginning,
the one, namely, that his seed should possess the land of
Canaan, which was intimated when it was said, "Go into a
land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great
nation;"<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> but the other far more excellent, concerning not
the carnal but the spiritual seed, by which he is the father,
not of the one nation of Israel, but of all nations who follow
the footsteps of his faith, which began to be promised in these
words, "And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
And thereafter we showed by yet many other proofs that these
two things were promised. Therefore the seed of Abraham,
that is, the people of Israel according to the flesh, already was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
in the land of promise; and there, not only by holding and
possessing the cities of the enemies, but also by having kings,
had already begun to reign, the promises of God concerning
that people being already in great part fulfilled: not only
those that were made to those three fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and whatever others were made in their times, but
those also that were made through Moses himself, by whom
the same people was set free from servitude in Egypt, and by
whom all bygone things were revealed in his times, when he
led the people through the wilderness. But neither by the
illustrious leader Jesus the son of Nun, who led that people
into the land of promise, and, after driving out the nations,
divided it among the twelve tribes according to God's command,
and died; nor after him, in the whole time of the
judges, was the promise of God concerning the land of Canaan
fulfilled, that it should extend from some river of Egypt even
to the great river Euphrates; nor yet was it still prophesied as
to come, but its fulfilment was expected. And it was fulfilled
through David, and Solomon his son, whose kingdom was extended
over the whole promised space; for they subdued all
those nations, and made them tributary. And thus, under
those kings, the seed of Abraham was established in the land
of promise according to the flesh, that is, in the land of Canaan,
so that nothing yet remained to the complete fulfilment of
that earthly promise of God, except that, so far as pertains to
temporal prosperity, the Hebrew nation should remain in the
same land by the succession of posterity in an unshaken state
even to the end of this mortal age, if it obeyed the laws of the
Lord its God. But since God knew it would not do this, He
used His temporal punishments also for training His few
faithful ones in it, and for giving needful warning to those
who should afterwards be in all nations, in whom the other
promise, revealed in the New Testament, was about to be
fulfilled through the incarnation of Christ.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap3"></a>3. <i>Of the threefold meaning of the prophecies, which are to be referred now to
the earthly, now to the heavenly Jerusalem, and now again to both.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore just as that divine oracle to Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the other prophetic signs or sayings which are
given in the earlier sacred writings, so also the other prophecies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
from this time of the kings pertain partly to the nation
of Abraham's flesh, and partly to that seed of his in which all
nations are blessed as fellow-heirs of Christ by the New Testament,
to the possessing of eternal life and the kingdom of the
heavens. Therefore they pertain partly to the bond maid who
gendereth to bondage, that is, the earthly Jerusalem, which is
in bondage with her children; but partly to the free city of
God, that is, the true Jerusalem eternal in the heavens, whose
children are all those that live according to God in the earth:
but there are some things among them which are understood
to pertain to both,&mdash;to the bond maid properly, to the free
woman figuratively.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Therefore prophetic utterances of three kinds are to be
found; forasmuch as there are some relating to the earthly
Jerusalem, some to the heavenly, and some to both. I think
it proper to prove what I say by examples. The prophet
Nathan was sent to convict king David of heinous sin, and
predict to him what future evils should be consequent on it.
Who can question that this and the like pertain to the terrestrial
city, whether publicly, that is, for the safety or help of
the people, or privately, when there are given forth for each
one's private good divine utterances whereby something of
the future may be known for the use of temporal life? But
where we read, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will make for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah,
a new testament: not according to the testament that I settled
for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to
lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued
not in my testament, and I regarded them not, saith the
Lord. For this is the testament that I will make for the
house of Israel: after those days, saith the Lord, I will give
my laws in their mind, and will write them upon their hearts,
and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and
they shall be to me a people;"<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>&mdash;without doubt this is prophesied
to the Jerusalem above, whose reward is God Himself,
and whose chief and entire good it is to have Him, and
to be His. But this pertains to both, that the city of
God is called Jerusalem, and that it is prophesied the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of God shall be in it; and this prophecy seems to be fulfilled
when king Solomon builds that most noble temple. For
these things both happened in the earthly Jerusalem, as history
shows, and were types of the heavenly Jerusalem. And this
kind of prophecy, as it were compacted and commingled of
both the others in the ancient canonical books, containing
historical narratives, is of very great significance, and has exercised
and exercises greatly the wits of those who search holy
writ. For example, what we read of historically as predicted
and fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to the flesh,
we must also inquire the allegorical meaning of, as it is to be
fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to faith. And so
much is this the case, that some have thought there is nothing
in these books either foretold and effected, or effected although
not foretold, that does not insinuate something else which is
to be referred by figurative signification to the city of God on
high, and to her children who are pilgrims in this life. But
if this be so, then the utterances of the prophets, or rather the
whole of those Scriptures that are reckoned under the title
of the Old Testament, will be not of three, but of two different
kinds. For there will be nothing there which pertains to the
terrestrial Jerusalem only, if whatever is there said and fulfilled
of or concerning her signifies something which also
refers by allegorical prefiguration to the celestial Jerusalem;
but there will be only two kinds, one that pertains to the free
Jerusalem, the other to both. But just as, I think, they err
greatly who are of opinion that none of the records of affairs
in that kind of writings mean anything more than that they
so happened, so I think those very daring who contend that
the whole gist of their contents lies in allegorical significations.
Therefore I have said they are threefold, not twofold. Yet, in
holding this opinion, I do not blame those who may be able
to draw out of everything there a spiritual meaning, only
saving, first of all, the historical truth. For the rest, what
believer can doubt that those things are spoken vainly which
are such that, whether said to have been done or to be yet to
come, they do not beseem either human or divine affairs? Who
would not recall these to spiritual understanding if he could,
or confess that they should be recalled by him who is able?</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap4"></a>4. <i>About the prefigured change of the Israelitic kingdom and priesthood, and
about the things Hannah the mother of Samuel prophesied, personating
the Church.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore the advance of the city of God, where it reached
the times of the kings, yielded a figure, when, on the rejection
of Saul, David first obtained the kingdom on such a footing
that thenceforth his descendants should reign in the earthly
Jerusalem in continual succession; for the course of affairs
signified and foretold, what is not to be passed by in silence,
concerning the change of things to come, what belongs to both
Testaments, the Old and the New,&mdash;where the priesthood and
kingdom are changed by one who is a priest, and at the same
time a king, new and everlasting, even Christ Jesus. For both
the substitution in the ministry of God, on Eli's rejection as
priest, of Samuel, who executed at once the office of priest
and judge, and the establishment of David in the kingdom,
when Saul was rejected, typified this of which I speak. And
Hannah herself, the mother of Samuel, who formerly was
barren, and afterwards was gladdened with fertility, does not
seem to prophesy anything else, when she exultingly pours
forth her thanksgiving to the Lord, on yielding up to God the
same boy she had born and weaned with the same piety with
which she had vowed him. For she says, "My heart is made
strong in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God; my
mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; I am made glad in Thy
salvation. Because there is none holy as the Lord; and none
is righteous as our God: there is none holy save Thee. Do
not glory so proudly, and do not speak lofty things, neither
let vaunting talk come out of your mouth: for a God of
knowledge is the Lord, and a God preparing His curious
designs. The bow of the mighty hath He made weak, and
the weak are girded with strength. They that were full of
bread are diminished; and the hungry have passed beyond the
earth: for the barren hath born seven; and she that hath
many children is waxed feeble. The Lord killeth and maketh
alive: He bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up again. The
Lord maketh poor and maketh rich: He bringeth low and
lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth
up the beggar from the dunghill, that He may set him among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the mighty of [His] people, and maketh them inherit the
throne of glory; giving the vow to him that voweth, and He
hath blessed the years of the just: for man is not mighty in
strength. The Lord shall make His adversary weak: the Lord
is holy. Let not the prudent glory in his prudence; and let
not the mighty glory in his might; and let not the rich glory
in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, to understand
and know the Lord, and to do judgment and justice in
the midst of the earth. The Lord hath ascended into the
heavens, and hath thundered: He shall judge the ends of the
earth, for He is righteous: and He giveth strength to our kings,
and shall exalt the horn of His Christ."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Do you say that these are the words of a single weak
woman giving thanks for the birth of a son? Can the mind
of men be so much averse to the light of truth as not to perceive
that the sayings this woman pours forth exceed her
measure? Moreover, he who is suitably interested in these
things which have already begun to be fulfilled even in this
earthly pilgrimage also, does he not apply his mind, and perceive,
and acknowledge, that through this woman&mdash;whose
very name, which is Hannah, means "His grace"&mdash;the very
Christian religion, the very city of God, whose king and
founder is Christ, in fine, the very grace of God, hath thus
spoken by the prophetic Spirit, whereby the proud are cut off
so that they fall, and the humble are filled so that they rise,
which that hymn chiefly celebrates? Unless perchance any
one will say that this woman prophesied nothing, but only
lauded God with exulting praise on account of the son whom
she had obtained in answer to prayer. What then does she
mean when she says, "The bow of the mighty hath He made
weak, and the weak are girded with strength; they that were
full of bread are diminished, and the hungry have gone
beyond the earth; for the barren hath born seven, and she
that hath many children is waxed feeble?" Had she herself
born seven, although she had been barren? She had only
one when she said that; neither did she bear seven afterwards,
nor six, with whom Samuel himself might be the
seventh, but three males and two females. And then, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
as yet no one was king over that people, whence, if she did
not prophesy, did she say what she puts at the end, "He
giveth strength to our kings, and shall exalt the horn of His
Christ?"</p>

<p>Therefore let the Church of Christ, the city of the great
King,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> full of grace, prolific of offspring, let her say what the
prophecy uttered about her so long before by the mouth of
this pious mother confesses, "My heart is made strong in
the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God." Her heart is
truly made strong, and her horn is truly exalted, because not
in herself, but in the Lord her God. "My mouth is enlarged
over mine enemies;" because even in pressing straits the
word of God is not bound, not even in preachers who are
bound.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> "I am made glad," she says, "in Thy salvation."
This is Christ Jesus Himself, whom old Simeon, as we read
in the Gospel, embracing as a little one, yet recognising as
great, said, "Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Therefore
may the Church say, "I am made glad in Thy salvation. For
there is none holy as the Lord, and none is righteous as our
God;" as holy and sanctifying, just and justifying.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> "There
is none holy beside Thee;" because no one becomes so except
by reason of Thee. And then it follows, "Do not glory so
proudly, and do not speak lofty things, neither let vaunting
talk come out of your mouth. For a God of knowledge is
the Lord." He knows you even when no one knows; for
"he who thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing
deceiveth himself."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> These things are said to the adversaries
of the city of God who belong to Babylon, who presume
in their own strength, and glory in themselves, not in the
Lord; of whom are also the carnal Israelites, the earth-born
inhabitants of the earthly Jerusalem, who, as saith the apostle,
"being ignorant of the righteousness of God,"<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> that is, which
God, who alone is just, and the justifier, gives to man, "and
wishing to establish their own," that is, which is as it were
procured by their own selves, not bestowed by Him, "are not
subject to the righteousness of God," just because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
proud, and think they are able to please God with their own,
not with that which is of God, who is the God of knowledge,
and therefore also takes the oversight of consciences, there
beholding the thoughts of men that they are vain,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> if they
are of men, and are not from Him. "And preparing," she
says, "His curious designs." What curious designs do we
think these are, save that the proud must fall, and the humble
rise? These curious designs she recounts, saying, "The bow
of the mighty is made weak, and the weak are girded with
strength." The bow is made weak, that is, the intention of
those who think themselves so powerful, that without the gift
and help of God they are able by human sufficiency to fulfil
the divine commandments; and those are girded with strength
whose inward cry is, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I
am weak."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>"They that were full of bread," she says, "are diminished,
and the hungry have gone beyond the earth." Who are to
be understood as full of bread except those same who were
as if mighty, that is, the Israelites, to whom were committed
the oracles of God?<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But among that people the children
of the bond maid were diminished,&mdash;by which word minus,
although it is Latin, the idea is well expressed that from
being greater they were made less,&mdash;because, even in the
very bread, that is, the divine oracles, which the Israelites
alone of all nations have received, they savour earthly things.
But the nations to whom that law was not given, after they
have come through the New Testament to these oracles, by
thirsting much have gone beyond the earth, because in them
they have savoured not earthly, but heavenly things. And
the reason why this is done is as it were sought; "for the
barren," she says, "hath born seven, and she that hath many
children is waxed feeble." Here all that had been prophesied
hath shone forth to those who understood the number seven,
which signifies the perfection of the universal Church. For
which reason also the Apostle John writes to the seven
churches,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> showing in that way that he writes to the totality
of the one Church; and in the Proverbs of Solomon it is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
aforetime, prefiguring this, "Wisdom hath builded her house,
she hath strengthened her seven pillars."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> For the city of
God was barren in all nations before that child arose whom
we see.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> We also see that the temporal Jerusalem, who had
many children, is now waxed feeble. Because, whoever in
her were sons of the free woman were her strength; but
now, forasmuch as the letter is there, and not the spirit,
having lost her strength, she is waxed feeble.</p>

<p>"The Lord killeth and maketh alive:" He has killed her
who had many children, and made this barren one alive, so
that she has born seven. Although it may be more suitably
understood that He has made those same alive whom He has
killed. For she, as it were, repeats that by adding, "He
bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up." To whom truly the
apostle says, "If ye be dead with Christ, seek those things
which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
God."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Therefore they are killed by the Lord in a salutary
way, so that he adds, "Savour things which are above, not
things on the earth;" so that these are they who, hungering,
have passed beyond the earth. "For ye are dead," he says:
behold how God savingly kills! Then there follows, "And
your life is hid with Christ in God:" behold how God makes
the same alive! But does He bring them down to hell and bring
them up again? It is without controversy among believers
that we best see both parts of this work fulfilled in Him, to
wit, our Head, with whom the apostle has said our life is hid
in God. "For when He spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all,"<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in that way, certainly, He has killed
Him. And forasmuch as He raised Him up again from the
dead, He has made Him alive again. And since His voice
is acknowledged in the prophecy, "Thou wilt not leave my
soul in hell,"<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> He has brought Him down to hell and brought
Him up again. By this poverty of His we are made rich;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
for "the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich." But that we
may know what this is, let us hear what follows: "He
bringeth low and lifteth up;" and truly He humbles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
proud and exalts the humble. Which we also read elsewhere,
"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> This is the burden of the entire song of this
woman whose name is interpreted "His grace."</p>

<p>Farther, what is added, "He raiseth up the poor from the
earth," I understand of none better than of Him who, as was
said a little ago, "was made poor for us, when He was rich,
that by His poverty we might be made rich." For He raised
Him from the earth so quickly that His flesh did not see
corruption. Nor shall I divert from Him what is added, "And
raiseth up the poor from the dunghill." For indeed he who
is the poor man is also the beggar.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But by the dunghill
from which he is lifted up we are with the greatest reason
to understand the persecuting Jews, of whom the apostle says,
when telling that when he belonged to them he persecuted
the Church, "What things were gain to me, those I counted
loss for Christ; and I have counted them not only loss, but
even dung, that I might win Christ."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Therefore that poor
one is raised up from the earth above all the rich, and that
beggar is lifted up from that dunghill above all the wealthy,
"that he may sit among the mighty of the people," to whom
He says, "Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> "and to make
them inherit the throne of glory." For these mighty ones
had said, "Lo, we have forsaken all and followed Thee."
They had most mightily vowed this vow.</p>

<p>But whence do they receive this, except from Him of whom
it is here immediately said, "Giving the vow to him that
voweth?" Otherwise they would be of those mighty ones
whose bow is weakened. "Giving," she saith, "the vow to
him that voweth." For no one could vow anything acceptable
to God, unless he received from Him that which he
might vow. There follows, "And He hath blessed the years
of the just," to wit, that he may live for ever with Him to
whom it is said, "And Thy years shall have no end." For
there the years abide; but here they pass away, yea, they
perish: for before they come they are not, and when they
shall have come they shall not be, because they bring their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
own end with them. Now of these two, that is, "giving
the vow to him that voweth," and "He hath blessed the years
of the just," the one is what we do, the other what we receive.
But this other is not received from God, the liberal
giver, until He, the helper, Himself has enabled us for the
former; "for man is not mighty in strength." "The Lord
shall make his adversary weak," to wit, him who envies the
man that vows, and resists him, lest he should fulfil what he
has vowed. Owing to the ambiguity of the Greek, it may
also be understood "his own adversary." For when God
has begun to possess us, immediately he who had been our
adversary becomes His, and is conquered by us; but not by
our own strength, "for man is not mighty in strength."
Therefore "the Lord shall make His own adversary weak,
the Lord is holy," that he may be conquered by the saints,
whom the Lord, the Holy of holies, hath made saints. For
this reason, "let not the prudent glory in his prudence, and
let not the mighty glory in his might, and let not the rich
glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in
this,&mdash;to understand and know the Lord, and to do judgment
and justice in the midst of the earth." He in no
small measure understands and knows the Lord who understands
and knows that even this, that he can understand and
know the Lord, is given to him by the Lord. "For what
hast thou," saith the apostle, "that thou hast not received?
But if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if
thou hadst not received it?"<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> That is, as if thou hadst of
thine own self whereof thou mightest glory. Now, he does
judgment and justice who lives aright. But he lives aright
who yields obedience to God when He commands. "The end
of the commandment," that is, to which the commandment
has reference, "is charity out of a pure heart, and a good
conscience, and faith unfeigned." Moreover, this "charity,"
as the Apostle John testifies, "is of God."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Therefore to do
justice and judgment is of God. But what is "in the midst
of the earth?" For ought those who dwell in the ends of
the earth not to do judgment and justice? Who would say
so? Why, then, is it added, "In the midst of the earth?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
For if this had not been added, and it had only been said, "To
do judgment and justice," this commandment would rather
have pertained to both kinds of men,&mdash;both those dwelling
inland and those on the sea-coast. But lest any one should
think that, after the end of the life led in this body, there
remains a time for doing judgment and justice which he has
not done while he was in the flesh, and that the divine judgment
can thus be escaped, "in the midst of the earth" appears
to me to be said of the time when every one lives in
the body; for in this life every one carries about his own
earth, which, on a man's dying, the common earth takes back,
to be surely returned to him on his rising again. Therefore
"in the midst of the earth," that is, while our soul is shut
up in this earthly body, judgment and justice are to be done,
which shall be profitable for us hereafter, when "every one
shall receive according to that he hath done in the body,
whether good or bad."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> For when the apostle there says "in
the body," he means in the time he has lived in the body.
Yet if any one blaspheme with malicious mind and impious
thought, without any member of his body being employed in
it, he shall not therefore be guiltless because he has not done
it with bodily motion, for he will have done it in that time
which he has spent in the body. In the same way we may
suitably understand what we read in the psalm, "But God, our
King before the worlds, hath wrought salvation in the midst
of the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> so that the Lord Jesus may be understood to be
our God who is before the worlds, because by Him the worlds
were made, working our salvation in the midst of the earth,
for the Word was made flesh and dwelt in an earthly body.</p>

<p>Then after Hannah has prophesied in these words, that
he who glorieth ought to glory not in himself at all, but in
the Lord, she says, on account of the retribution which is to
come on the day of judgment, "The Lord hath ascended into
the heavens, and hath thundered: He shall judge the ends of
the earth, for He is righteous." Throughout she holds to the
order of the creed of Christians: For the Lord Christ has
ascended into heaven, and is to come thence to judge the quick
and dead.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> For, as saith the apostle, "Who hath ascended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
but He who hath also descended into the lower parts of the
earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended
up above all heavens, that He might fill all things."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Therefore
He hath thundered through His clouds, which He hath
filled with His Holy Spirit when He ascended up. Concerning
which the bond maid Jerusalem that is, the unfruitful
vineyard is threatened in Isaiah the prophet that they
shall rain no showers upon her. But "He shall judge the
ends of the earth" is spoken as if it had been said, "even
the extremes of the earth." For it does not mean that He
shall not judge the other parts of the earth, who, without
doubt, shall judge all men. But it is better to understand
by the extremes of the earth the extremes of man, since
those things shall not be judged which, in the middle time,
are changed for the better or the worse, but the ending in
which he shall be found who is judged. For which reason
it is said, "He that shall persevere even unto the end, the
same shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> He, therefore, who perseveringly does
judgment and justice in the midst of the earth shall not be
condemned when the extremes of the earth shall be judged.
"And giveth," she saith, "strength to our kings," that He may
not condemn them in judging. He giveth them strength
whereby as kings they rule the flesh, and conquer the world
in Him who hath poured out His blood for them. "And
shall exalt the horn of His Christ." For He of whom it was said above,
"The Lord hath ascended into the heavens," meaning the Lord
Christ, Himself, as it is said here, "shall exalt the horn of His
Christ." Who, therefore, is the Christ of His Christ? Does
it mean that He shall exalt the horn of each one of His believing
people, as she says in the beginning of this hymn,
"Mine horn is exalted in my God?" For we can rightly
call all those christs who are anointed with His chrism, forasmuch
as the whole body with its head is one Christ.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> These
things hath Hannah, the mother of Samuel, the holy and
much-praised man, prophesied, in which, indeed, the change
of the ancient priesthood was then figured and is now fulfilled,
since she that had many children is waxed feeble, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the barren who hath born seven might have the new priesthood
in Christ.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>5. <i>Of those things which a man of God spake by the Spirit to Eli the priest,
signifying that the priesthood which had been appointed according to
Aaron was to be taken away.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But this is said more plainly by a man of God sent to Eli
the priest himself, whose name indeed is not mentioned, but
whose office and ministry show him to have been indubitably
a prophet. For it is thus written: "And there came a man
of God unto Eli, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I plainly
revealed myself unto thy father's house, when they were in
the land of Egypt slaves in Pharaoh's house; and I chose thy
father's house out of all the sceptres of Israel to fill the office
of priest for me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense and
wear the ephod; and I gave thy father's house for food all
the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel. Wherefore
then hast thou looked at mine incense and at mine offerings
with an impudent eye, and hast glorified thy sons above
me, to bless the first-fruits of every sacrifice in Israel before
me? Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I said thy
house and thy father's house should walk before me for ever:
but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that
honour me will I honour, and he that despiseth me shall be
despised. Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy seed,
and the seed of thy father's house, and thou shalt never have
an old man in my house. And I will cut off the man of thine
from mine altar, so that his eyes shall be consumed, and his
heart shall melt away; and every one of thy house that is
left shall fall by the sword of men. And this shall be a sign
unto thee that shall come upon these thy two sons, Hophni
and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. And
I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to
all that is in mine heart and in my soul; and I will build
him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for
ever. And it shall come to pass that he who is left in thine
house shall come to worship him with a piece of money, saying,
Put me into one part of thy priesthood, that I may eat bread."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>We cannot say that this prophecy, in which the change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the ancient priesthood is foretold with so great plainness, was
fulfilled in Samuel; for although Samuel was not of another
tribe than that which had been appointed by God to serve at
the altar, yet he was not of the sons of Aaron, whose offspring
was set apart that the priests might be taken out of it. And
thus by that transaction also the same change which should
come to pass through Christ Jesus is shadowed forth, and the
prophecy itself in deed, not in word, belonged to the Old
Testament properly, but figuratively to the New, signifying
by the fact just what was said by the word to Eli the priest
through the prophet. For there were afterwards priests of
Aaron's race, such as Zadok and Abiathar during David's
reign, and others in succession, before the time came when
those things which were predicted so long before about the
changing of the priesthood behoved to be fulfilled by Christ.
But who that now views these things with a believing eye
does not see that they are fulfilled? Since, indeed, no tabernacle,
no temple, no altar, no sacrifice, and therefore no priest
either, has remained to the Jews, to whom it was commanded
in the law of God that he should be ordained of the seed of
Aaron; which is also mentioned here by the prophet, when
he says, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I said thy house
and thy father's house shall walk before me for ever: but
now the Lord saith, That be far from me; for them that honour
me will I honour, and he that despiseth me shall be despised."
For that in naming his father's house he does not mean that
of his immediate father, but that of Aaron, who first was
appointed priest, to be succeeded by others descended from
him, is shown by the preceding words, when he says, "I was
revealed unto thy father's house, when they were in the land
of Egypt slaves in Pharaoh's house; and I chose thy father's
house out of all the sceptres of Israel to fill the office of priest
for me." Which of the fathers in that Egyptian slavery, but
Aaron, was his father, who, when they were set free, was
chosen to the priesthood? It was of his lineage, therefore, he
has said in this passage it should come to pass that they should
no longer be priests; which already we see fulfilled. If faith
be watchful, the things are before us: they are discerned, they
are grasped, and are forced on the eyes of the unwilling, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
that they are seen: "Behold the days come," he says, "that
I will cut off thy seed, and the seed of thy father's house, and
thou shalt never have an old man in mine house. And I will
cut off the man of thine from mine altar, so that his eyes shall
be consumed and his heart shall melt away." Behold the
days which were foretold have already come. There is no
priest after the order of Aaron; and whoever is a man of his
lineage, when he sees the sacrifice of the Christians prevailing
over the whole world, but that great honour taken away from
himself, his eyes fail and his soul melts away consumed with
grief.</p>

<p>But what follows belongs properly to the house of Eli, to
whom these things were said: "And every one of thine house
that is left shall fall by the sword of men. And this shall
be a sign unto thee that shall come upon these thy two sons,
Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of
them." This, therefore, is made a sign of the change of the
priesthood from this man's house, by which it is signified that
the priesthood of Aaron's house is to be changed. For the
death of this man's sons signified the death not of the men,
but of the priesthood itself of the sons of Aaron. But what
follows pertains to that Priest whom Samuel typified by succeeding
this one. Therefore the things which follow are said
of Christ Jesus the true Priest of the New Testament: "And
I will raise me up a faithful Priest that shall do according to
all that is in mine heart and in my soul; and I will build
Him a sure house." The same is the eternal Jerusalem above.
"And He shall walk," saith He, "before my Christ always."
"He shall walk" means "he shall be conversant with," just as
He had said before of Aaron's house, "I said that thine house
and thy father's house shall walk before me for ever." But
what He says, "He shall walk before my Christ," is to be
understood entirely of the house itself, not of the priest, who
is Christ Himself, the Mediator and Saviour. His house,
therefore, shall walk before Him. "Shall walk" may also be
understood to mean from death to life, all the time this mortality
passes through, even to the end of this world. But
where God says, "Who will do all that is in mine heart and
in my soul," we must not think that God has a soul, for He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
is the Author of souls; but this is said of God tropically, not
properly, just as He is said to have hands and feet, and other
corporal members. And, lest it should be supposed from
such language that man in the form of this flesh is made in
the image of God, wings also are ascribed to Him, which man
has not at all; and it is said to God, "Hide me under the
shadow of Thy wings,"<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> that men may understand that such
things are said of that ineffable nature not in proper but in
figurative words.</p>

<p>But what is added, "And it shall come to pass that he who
is left in thine house shall come to worship Him," is not said
properly of the house of this Eli, but of that Aaron, the men
of which remained even to the advent of Jesus Christ, of
which race there are not wanting men even to this present.
For of that house of Eli it had already been said above, "And
every one of thine house that is left shall fall by the sword of
men." How, therefore, could it be truly said here, "And it
shall come to pass that every one that is left shall come to
worship him," if that is true, that no one shall escape the
avenging sword, unless he would have it understood of those
who belong to the race of that whole priesthood after the order
of Aaron? Therefore, if it is of these the predestinated
remnant, about whom another prophet has said, "The remnant
shall be saved;"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> whence the apostle also says, "Even so then
at this time also the remnant according to the election of
grace is saved;"<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> since it is easily understood to be of such
a remnant that it is said, "He that is left in thine house,"
assuredly he believes in Christ; just as in the time of the
apostle very many of that nation believed; nor are there now
wanting those, although very few, who yet believe, and in
them is fulfilled what this man of God has here immediately
added, "He shall come to worship him with a piece of money;"
to worship whom, if not that Chief Priest, who is also God?
For in that priesthood after the order of Aaron men did not
come to the temple or altar of God for the purpose of worshipping
the priest. But what is that he says, "With a piece
of money," if not the short word of faith, about which the
apostle quotes the saying, "A consummating and shortening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
word will the Lord make upon the earth?"<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> But that
money is put for the word the psalm is a witness, where it
is sung, "The words of the Lord are pure words, money tried
with the fire."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>What then does he say who comes to worship the priest of
God, even the Priest who is God? "Put me into one part of
Thy priesthood, to eat bread." I do not wish to be set in the
honour of my fathers, which is none; put me in a part of Thy
priesthood. For "I have chosen to be mean in Thine house;"<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
I desire to be a member, no matter what, or how small, of Thy
priesthood. By the priesthood he here means the people itself,
of which He is the Priest who is the Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This people the Apostle Peter
calls "a holy people, a royal priesthood."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But some have
translated, "Of Thy sacrifice," not "Of Thy priesthood," which
no less signifies the same Christian people. Whence the
Apostle Paul says, "We being many are one bread, one body."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
[And again he says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>]
What, therefore, he has added, to "eat bread," also elegantly
expresses the very kind of sacrifice of which the Priest Himself
says, "The bread which I will give is my flesh for the life
of the world."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The same is the sacrifice not after the order
of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedec:<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> let him that
readeth understand.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Therefore this short and salutarily
humble confession, in which it is said, "Put me in a part of
Thy priesthood, to eat bread," is itself the piece of money, for
it is both brief, and it is the Word of God who dwells in the
heart of one who believes. For because He had said above,
that He had given for food to Aaron's house the sacrificial
victims of the Old Testament, where He says, "I have given
thy father's house for food all things which are offered by fire
of the children of Israel," which indeed were the sacrifices of
the Jews; therefore here He has said, "To eat bread," which
is in the New Testament the sacrifice of the Christians.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>6. <i>Of the Jewish priesthood and kingdom, which, although promised to be established
for ever, did not continue; so that other things are to be understood
to which eternity is assured.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>While, therefore, these things now shine forth as clearly
as they were loftily foretold, still some one may not vainly
be moved to ask, How can we be confident that all things
are to come to pass which are predicted in these books as
about to come, if this very thing which is there divinely
spoken, "Thine house and thy father's house shall walk
before me for ever," could not have effect? For we see that
priesthood has been changed; and there can be no hope that
what was promised to that house may some time be fulfilled,
because that which succeeds on its being rejected and changed
is rather predicted as eternal. He who says this does not
yet understand, or does not recollect, that this very priesthood
after the order of Aaron was appointed as the shadow
of a future eternal priesthood; and therefore, when eternity
is promised to it, it is not promised to the mere shadow and
figure, but to what is shadowed forth and prefigured by it.
But lest it should be thought the shadow itself was to remain,
therefore its mutation also behoved to be foretold.</p>

<p>In this way, too, the kingdom of Saul himself, who certainly
was reprobated and rejected, was the shadow of a
kingdom yet to come which should remain to eternity. For,
indeed, the oil with which he was anointed, and from that
chrism he is called Christ, is to be taken in a mystical sense,
and is to be understood as a great mystery; which David
himself venerated so much in him, that he trembled with
smitten heart when, being hid in a dark cave, which Saul
also entered when pressed by the necessity of nature, he had
come secretly behind him and cut off a small piece of his
robe, that he might be able to prove how he had spared him
when he could have killed him, and might thus remove from
his mind the suspicion through which he had vehemently
persecuted the holy David, thinking him his enemy. Therefore
he was much afraid lest he should be accused of violating
so great a mystery in Saul, because he had thus meddled
even his clothes. For thus it is written: "And David's
heart smote him because he had taken away the skirt of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
cloak."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> But to the men with him, who advised him to destroy
Saul thus delivered up into his hands, he saith, "The Lord forbid
that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's christ, to lay
my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's christ." Therefore
he showed so great reverence to this shadow of what was
to come, not for its own sake, but for the sake of what it
prefigured. Whence also that which Samuel says to Saul,
"Since thou hast not kept my commandment which the Lord
commanded thee, whereas now the Lord would have prepared
thy kingdom over Israel for ever, yet now thy kingdom shall
not continue for thee; and the Lord will seek Him a man after
His own heart, and the Lord will command him to be prince
over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord
commanded thee,"<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> is not to be taken as if God had settled
that Saul himself should reign for ever, and afterwards, on his
sinning, would not keep this promise; nor was He ignorant
that he would sin, but He had established his kingdom that
it might be a figure of the eternal kingdom. Therefore he
added, "Yet now thy kingdom shall not continue <i>for thee</i>."
Therefore what it signified has stood and shall stand; but it
shall not stand for this man, because he himself was not to
reign for ever, nor his offspring; so that at least that word
"for ever" might seem to be fulfilled through his posterity
one to another. "And the Lord," he saith, "will seek Him
a man," meaning either David or the Mediator of the New
Testament,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> who was figured in the chrism with which David
also and his offspring was anointed. But it is not as if He
knew not where he was that God thus seeks Him a man,
but, speaking through a man, He speaks as a man, and in this
sense seeks us. For not only to God the Father, but also to
His Only-begotten, who came to seek what was lost,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> we had
been known already even so far as to be chosen in Him
before the foundation of the world.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> "He will seek him"
therefore means, He will have His own (just as if He had
said, Whom He already has known to be His own He will
show to others to be His friend). Whence in Latin this word
(<i>quærit</i>) receives a preposition and becomes <i>acquirit</i> (acquires),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the meaning of which is plain enough; although even without
the addition of the preposition <i>quærere</i> is understood as
<i>acquirere</i>, whence gains are called <i>quæstus</i>.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the disruption of the kingdom of Israel, by which the perpetual division of
the spiritual from the carnal Israel was prefigured.</i></p>

<p>Again Saul sinned through disobedience, and again Samuel
says to him in the word of the Lord, "Because thou hast despised
the word of the Lord, the Lord hath despised thee, that
thou mayest not be king over Israel."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> And again for the same
sin, when Saul confessed it, and prayed for pardon, and besought
Samuel to return with him to appease the Lord, he said, "I
will not return with thee: for thou hast despised the word of
the Lord, and the Lord will despise thee that thou mayest not
be king over Israel. And Samuel turned his face to go away,
and Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and rent it.
And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom
from Israel out of thine hand this day, and will give it to thy
neighbour, who is good above thee, and will divide Israel in
twain. And He will not be changed, neither will He repent:
for He is not as a man, that He should repent; who threatens
and does not persist."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> He to whom it is said, "The Lord
will despise thee that thou mayest not be king over Israel,"
and "The Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel out of
thine hand this day," reigned forty years over Israel,&mdash;that is,
just as long a time as David himself,&mdash;yet heard this in the
first period of his reign, that we may understand it was said
because none of his race was to reign, and that we may look
to the race of David, whence also is sprung, according to the
flesh,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>But the Scripture has not what is read in most Latin
copies, "The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel out of
thine hand this day," but just as we have set it down it is
found in the Greek copies, "The Lord hath rent the kingdom
from Israel out of thine hand;" that the words "out of thine
hand" may be understood to mean "from Israel." Therefore
this man figuratively represented the people of Israel, which
was to lose the kingdom, Christ Jesus our Lord being about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to reign, not carnally, but spiritually. And when it is said
of Him, "And will give it to thy neighbour," that is to be referred
to the fleshly kinship, for Christ, according to the flesh,
was of Israel, whence also Saul sprang. But what is added,
"Good above thee," may indeed be understood, "Better than
thee," and indeed some have thus translated it; but it is
better taken thus, "Good above thee," as meaning that because
He is good, therefore He must be above thee, according
to that other prophetic saying, "Till I put all Thine enemies
under Thy feet."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> And among them is Israel, from whom, as
His persecutor, Christ took away the kingdom; although the
Israel in whom there was no guile may have been there too,
a sort of grain, as it were, of that chaff. For certainly thence
came the apostles, thence so many martyrs, of whom Stephen,
is the first, thence so many churches, which the Apostle Paul
names, magnifying God in their conversion.</p>

<p>Of which thing I do not doubt what follows is to be understood,
"And will divide Israel in twain," to wit, into Israel
pertaining to the bond woman, and Israel pertaining to the
free. For these two kinds were at first together, as Abraham
still clave to the bond woman, until the barren, made,
fruitful by the grace of God, cried, "Cast out the bond
woman and her son."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> We know, indeed, that on account
of the sin of Solomon, in the reign of his son Rehoboam
Israel was divided in two, and continued so, the separate parts
having their own kings, until that whole nation was overthrown
with a great destruction, and carried away by the Chaldeans.
But what was this to Saul, when, if any such thing was
threatened, it would be threatened against David himself,
whose son Solomon was? Finally, the Hebrew nation is not
now divided internally, but is dispersed through the earth indiscriminately,
in the fellowship of the same error. But that
division with which God threatened the kingdom and people
in the person of Saul, who represented them, is shown to be
eternal and unchangeable by this which is added, "And He
will not be changed, neither will He repent: for He is not as
a man, that He should repent; who threatens and does not persist,"&mdash;that
is, a man threatens and does not persist, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
God, who does not repent like man. For when we read that
He repents, a change of circumstance is meant, flowing from the
divine immutable foreknowledge. Therefore, when God is said
not to repent, it is to be understood that He does not change.</p>

<p>We see that this sentence concerning this division of the
people of Israel, divinely uttered in these words, has been
altogether irremediable and quite perpetual. For whoever
have turned, or are turning, or shall turn thence to Christ, it
has been according to the foreknowledge of God, not according
to the one and the same nature of the human race. Certainly
none of the Israelites, who, cleaving to Christ, have
continued in Him, shall ever be among those Israelites who
persist in being His enemies even to the end of this life,
but shall for ever remain in the separation which is here
foretold. For the Old Testament, from the Mount Sinai,
which gendereth to bondage,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> profiteth nothing, unless because
it bears witness to the New Testament. Otherwise, however
long Moses is read, the veil is put over their heart; but
when any one shall turn thence to Christ, the veil shall be
taken away.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> For the very desire of those who turn is
changed from the old to the new, so that each no longer
desires to obtain carnal but spiritual felicity. Wherefore
that great prophet Samuel himself, before he had anointed
Saul, when he had cried to the Lord for Israel, and He had
heard him, and when he had offered a whole burnt-offering,
as the aliens were coming to battle against the people of God,
and the Lord thundered above them and they were confused,
and fell before Israel and were overcome; [then] he took one
stone and set it up between the old and new Massephat
(Mizpeh), and called its name Ebenezer, which means "the
stone of the helper," and said, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped
us."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Massephat is interpreted "desire." That stone of the
helper is the mediation of the Saviour, by which we go from
the old Massephat to the new,&mdash;that is, from the desire with
which carnal happiness was expected in the carnal kingdom
to the desire with which the truest spiritual happiness is expected
in the kingdom of heaven; and since nothing is better
than that, the Lord helpeth us hitherto.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="chap8"></a>8. <i>Of the promises made to David in his son, which are in no wise fulfilled in
Solomon, but most fully in Christ.</i></p>

<p>And now I see I must show what, pertaining to the matter
I treat of, God promised to David himself, who succeeded Saul
in the kingdom, whose change prefigured that final change on
account of which all things were divinely spoken, all things
were committed to writing. When many things had gone prosperously
with king David, he thought to make a house for
God, even that temple of most excellent renown which was
afterwards built by king Solomon his son. While he was
thinking of this, the word of the Lord came to Nathan the
prophet, which he brought to the king, in which, after God
had said that a house should not be built unto Him by David
himself, and that in all that long time He had never commanded
any of His people to build Him a house of cedar, he
says, "And now thus shalt thou say unto my servant David,
Thus saith God Almighty, I took thee from the sheep-cote
that thou mightest be for a ruler over my people in Israel:
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have
cut off all thine enemies from before thy face, and have made
thee a name, according to the name of the great ones who are
over the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people
Israel, and will plant him, and he shall dwell apart, and shall
be troubled no more; and the son of wickedness shall not
humble him any more, as from the beginning, from the days
when I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will
give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell
[hath told] thee, because thou shalt build an house for Him.
And it shall come to pass when thy days be fulfilled, and
thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy
seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I
will prepare his kingdom. He shall build me an house for
my name; and I will order his throne even to eternity. I
will be his Father, and he shall be my son. And if he commit
iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with
the stripes of the sons of men: but my mercy I will not take
away from him, as I took it away from those whom I put
away from before my face. And his house shall be faithful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and his kingdom even for evermore before me, and his throne
shall be set up even for evermore."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>He who thinks this grand promise was fulfilled in Solomon
greatly errs; for he attends to the saying, "He shall build
me an house," but he does not attend to the saying, "His
house shall be faithful, and his kingdom for evermore before
me." Let him therefore attend and behold the house of
Solomon full of strange women worshipping false gods, and
the king himself, aforetime wise, seduced by them, and cast
down into the same idolatry: and let him not dare to think
that God either promised this falsely, or was unable to foreknow
that Solomon and his house would become what they
did. But we ought not to be in doubt here, or to see the
fulfilment of these things save in Christ our Lord, who was
made of the seed of David according to the flesh,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> lest we
should vainly and uselessly look for some other here, like the
carnal Jews. For even they understand this much, that the
son whom they read of in that place as promised to David
was not Solomon; so that, with wonderful blindness to Him
who was promised and is now declared with so great manifestation,
they say they hope for another. Indeed, even in Solomon
there appeared some image of the future event, in that
he built the temple, and had peace according to his name (for
Solomon means "pacific"), and in the beginning of his reign
was wonderfully praiseworthy; but while, as a shadow of Him
that should come, he foreshowed Christ our Lord, he did not
also in his own person resemble Him. Whence some things
concerning him are so written as if they were prophesied
of himself, while the Holy Scripture, prophesying even by
events, somehow delineates in him the figure of things to
come. For, besides the books of divine history, in which his
reign is narrated, the 72d Psalm also is inscribed in the title
with his name, in which so many things are said which cannot
at all apply to him, but which apply to the Lord Christ
with such evident fitness as makes it quite apparent that in
the one the figure is in some way shadowed forth, but in the
other the truth itself is presented. For it is known within
what bounds the kingdom of Solomon was enclosed; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in that psalm, not to speak of other things, we read, "He
shall have dominion from sea even to sea, and from the river
to the ends of the earth,"<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> which we see fulfilled in Christ.
Truly he took the beginning of His reigning from the river
where John baptized; for, when pointed out by him, He began
to be acknowledged by the disciples, who called Him not only
Master, but also Lord.</p>

<p>Nor was it for any other reason that, while his father David
was still living, Solomon began to reign, which happened to
none other of their kings, except that from this also it might
be clearly apparent that it was not himself this prophecy
spoken to his father signified beforehand, saying, "And it
shall come to pass when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt
sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed which
shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will prepare His kingdom."
How, therefore, shall it be thought on account of what
follows, "He shall build me an house," that this Solomon is
prophesied, and not rather be understood on account of what
precedes, "When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep
with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee," that
another pacific One is promised, who is foretold as about to
be raised up, not before David's death, as he was, but after
it? For however long the interval of time might be before
Jesus Christ came, beyond doubt it was after the death of
king David, to whom He was so promised, that He behoved
to come, who should build an house of God, not of wood and
stone, but of men, such as we rejoice He does build. For to
this house, that is, to believers, the apostle saith, "The temple
of God is holy, which temple ye are."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>


<p class="center">9. <i>How like the prophecy about Christ in the</i> 89<i>th Psalm is to the things

<p>Wherefore also in the 89th Psalm, of which the title is,
"An instruction for himself by Ethan the Israelite," mention
is made of the promises God made to king David, and some
things are there added similar to those found in the Book of
Samuel, such as this, "I have sworn to David my servant
that I will prepare his seed for ever."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> And again, "Then

help upon the mighty One, and have exalted the chosen One
out of my people. I have found David my servant, and with
my holy oil I have anointed him. For mine hand shall help
him, and mine arm shall strengthen him. The enemy shall
not prevail against him, and the son of iniquity shall harm
him no more. And I will beat down his foes from before
his face, and those that hate him will I put to flight. And
my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name
shall his horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the
sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto me,
Thou art my Father, my God, and the undertaker of my salvation.
Also I will make him my first-born, high among the
kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
and my covenant shall be faithful (sure) with him.
His seed also will I set for ever and ever, and his throne as
the days of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Which words, when rightly understood,
are all understood to be about the Lord Jesus Christ, under
the name of David, on account of the form of a servant, which
the same Mediator assumed<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> from the virgin of the seed of
David.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> For immediately something is said about the sins of
his children, such as is set down in the Book of Samuel, and
is more readily taken as if of Solomon. For there, that is,
in the Book of Samuel, he says, "And if he commit iniquity,
I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
of the sons of men; but my mercy will I not take away from
him,"<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> meaning by stripes the strokes of correction. Hence
that saying, "Touch ye not my christs."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> For what else is
that than, Do not harm them? But in the psalm, when
speaking as if of David, He says something of the same kind
there too. "If his children," saith He, "forsake my law, and
walk not in my judgments; if they profane my righteousnesses,
and keep not my commandments; I will visit their
iniquities with the rod, and their faults with stripes: but my
mercy I will not make void from him."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> He did not say
"from them," although He spoke of his children, not of himself;
but he said "from him," which means the same thing
if rightly understood. For of Christ Himself, who is the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of the Church, there could not be found any sins which required
to be divinely restrained by human correction, mercy
being still continued; but they are found in His body and
members, which is His people. Therefore in the Book of
Samuel it is said, "iniquity of Him," but in the psalm, "of
His children," that we may understand that what is said of
His body is in some way said of Himself. Wherefore also,
when Saul persecuted His body, that is, His believing people,
He Himself saith from heaven, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?"<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Then in the following words of the psalm He
says, "Neither will I hurt in my truth, nor profane my covenant,
and the things that proceed from my lips I will not
disallow. Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I lie unto
David,"<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>&mdash;that is, I will in no wise lie unto David; for
Scripture is wont to speak thus. But what that is in which
He will not lie, He adds, saying, "His seed shall endure for
ever, and his throne as the sun before me, and as the moon
perfected for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

understood to pertain to the glory of the other King and kingdom.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>That it might not be supposed that a promise so strongly
expressed and confirmed was fulfilled in Solomon, as if he
hoped for, yet did not find it, he says, "But Thou hast cast off,
and hast brought to nothing, O Lord."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> This truly was done
concerning the kingdom of Solomon among his posterity, even
to the overthrow of the earthly Jerusalem itself, which was
the seat of the kingdom, and especially the destruction of the
very temple which had been built by Solomon. But lest on
this account God should be thought to have done contrary to
His promise, immediately he adds, "Thou hast delayed Thy
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Therefore he is not Solomon, nor yet David himself,
if the Christ of the Lord is delayed. For while all the
kings are called His christs, who were consecrated with that
mystical chrism, not only from king David downwards, but
even from that Saul who first was anointed king of that same
people, David himself indeed calling him the Lord's christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
yet there was one true Christ, whose figure they bore by the
prophetic unction, who, according to the opinion of men, who
thought he was to be understood as come in David or in
Solomon, was long delayed, but who, according as God had
disposed, was to come in His own time. The following part
of this psalm goes on to say what in the meantime, while He
was delayed, was to become of the kingdom of the earthly
Jerusalem, where it was hoped He would certainly reign:
"Thou hast overthrown the covenant of Thy servant; Thou
hast profaned in the earth his sanctuary. Thou hast broken
down all his walls; Thou hast put his strongholds in fear.
All that pass by the way spoil him; he is made a reproach
to his neighbours. Thou hast set up the right hand of his
enemies; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. Thou
hast turned aside the help of his sword, and hast not helped
him in war. Thou hast destroyed him from cleansing; Thou
hast dashed down his seat to the ground. Thou hast shortened
the days of his seat; Thou hast poured confusion over
him."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> All these things came upon Jerusalem the bond
woman, in which some also reigned who were children of the
free woman, holding that kingdom in temporary stewardship,
but holding the kingdom of the heavenly Jerusalem, whose
children they were, in true faith, and hoping in the true
Christ. But how these things came upon that kingdom, the
history of its affairs points out if it is read.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the substance of the people of God, which through His assumption of
flesh is in Christ, who alone had power to deliver His own soul from hell.</i></p>

<p>But after having prophesied these things, the prophet betakes
him to praying to God; yet even the very prayer is
prophecy: "How long, Lord, dost Thou turn away in the
end?"<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> "Thy face" is understood, as it is elsewhere said,
"How long dost Thou turn away Thy face from me?"<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> For
therefore some copies have here not "dost," but "wilt Thou
turn away;" although it could be understood, "Thou turnest
away Thy mercy, which Thou didst promise to David." But
when he says, "in the end," what does it mean, except even
to the end? By which end is to be understood the last time,
when even that nation is to believe in Christ Jesus, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
which end what He has just sorrowfully bewailed must come
to pass. On account of which it is also added here, "Thy
wrath shall burn like fire. Remember what is my substance."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
This cannot be better understood than of Jesus
Himself, the substance of His people, of whose nature His
flesh is. "For not in vain," he says, "hast Thou made all the
sons of men."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> For unless the one Son of man had been the
substance of Israel, through which Son of man many sons of
men should be set free, all the sons of men would have been
made wholly in vain. But now indeed all mankind through
the fall of the first man has fallen from the truth into vanity;
for which reason another psalm says, "Man is like to vanity:
his days pass away as a shadow;"<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> yet God has not made all
the sons of men in vain, because He frees many from vanity
through the Mediator Jesus, and those whom He did not foreknow
as to be delivered, He made not wholly in vain in the
most beautiful and most just ordination of the whole rational
creation, for the use of those who were to be delivered, and
for the comparison of the two cities by mutual contrast.
Thereafter it follows, "Who is the man that shall live, and
shall not see death? shall he snatch his soul from the hand
of hell?"<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Who is this but that substance of Israel out of
the seed of David, Christ Jesus, of whom the apostle says,
that "rising from the dead He now dieth not, and death shall
no more have dominion over Him?"<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> For He shall so live and
not see death, that yet He shall have been dead; but shall
have delivered His soul from the hand of hell, whither He had
descended in order to loose some from the chains of hell; but
He hath delivered it by that power of which He says in the
Gospel, "I have the power of laying down my life, and I have
the power of taking it again."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>12. <i>To whose person the entreaty for the promises is to be understood to belong,
when he says in the psalm, "Where are Thine ancient compassions,
Lord?" etc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But the rest of this psalm runs thus: "Where are Thine
ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in
Thy truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
which I have borne in my bosom of many nations; wherewith
Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they
have reproached the change of Thy Christ."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Now it may
with very good reason be asked whether this is spoken in the
person of those Israelites who desired that the promise made
to David might be fulfilled to them; or rather of the Christians,
who are Israelites not after the flesh but after the
Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> This certainly was spoken or written in the time of
Ethan, from whose name this psalm gets its title, and that
was the same as the time of David's reign; and therefore it
would not have been said, "Where are Thine ancient compassions,
Lord, which Thou hast sworn unto David in Thy
truth?" unless the prophet had assumed the person of those
who should come long afterwards, to whom that time when
these things were promised to David was ancient. But it
may be understood thus, that many nations, when they persecuted
the Christians, reproached them with the passion of
Christ, which Scripture calls His change, because by dying
He is made immortal. The change of Christ, according to
this passage, may also be understood to be reproached by the
Israelites, because, when they hoped He would be theirs, He
was made the Saviour of the nations; and many nations who
have believed in Him by the New Testament now reproach
them who remain in the old with this: so that it is said, "Remember,
Lord, the reproach of Thy servants;" because through
the Lord's not forgetting, but rather pitying them, even they
after this reproach are to believe. But what I have put first
seems to me the most suitable meaning. For to the enemies
of Christ who are reproached with this, that Christ hath left
them, turning to the Gentiles,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> this speech is incongruously
assigned, "Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,"
for such Jews are not to be styled the servants of God; but
these words fit those who, if they suffered great humiliations
through persecution for the name of Christ, could call to mind
that an exalted kingdom had been promised to the seed of
David, and in desire of it, could say not despairingly, but as
asking, seeking, knocking,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> "Where are Thine ancient compassions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth? Remember,
Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, that I have borne
in my bosom of many nations;" that is, have patiently endured
in my inward parts. "That Thine enemies have reproached,
O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy
Christ," not thinking it a change, but a consumption.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But what
does "Remember, Lord," mean, but that Thou wouldst have
compassion, and wouldst for my patiently borne humiliation
reward me with the excellency which Thou swarest unto David
in Thy truth? But if we assign these words to the Jews,
those servants of God who, on the conquest of the earthly
Jerusalem, before Jesus Christ was born after the manner of
men, were led into captivity, could say such things, understanding
the change of Christ, because indeed through Him
was to be surely expected, not an earthly and carnal felicity,
such as appeared during the few years of king Solomon, but a
heavenly and spiritual felicity; and when the nations, then
ignorant of this through unbelief, exulted over and insulted
the people of God for being captives, what else was this than
ignorantly to reproach with the change of Christ those who
understand the change of Christ? And therefore what follows
when this psalm is concluded, "Let the blessing of the
Lord be for evermore, amen, amen," is suitable enough for
the whole people of God belonging to the heavenly Jerusalem,
whether for those things that lay hid in the Old Testament
before the New was revealed, or for those that, being now
revealed in the New Testament, are manifestly discerned to
belong to Christ. For the blessing of the Lord in the seed of
David does not belong to any particular time, such as appeared
in the days of Solomon, but is for evermore to be
hoped for, in which most certain hope it is said, "Amen,
amen;" for this repetition of the word is the confirmation of
that hope. Therefore David understanding this, says in the
second Book of Kings, in the passage from which we digressed
to this psalm,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> "Thou hast spoken also for Thy servant's house
for a great while to come."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Therefore also a little after he
says, "Now begin, and bless the house of Thy servant for evermore,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
etc., because the son was then about to be born from
whom his posterity should be continued to Christ, through
whom his house should be eternal, and should also be the
house of God. For it is called the house of David on account
of David's race; but the selfsame is called the house of God
on account of the temple of God, made of men, not of stones,
where shall dwell for evermore the people with and in their
God, and God with and in His people, so that God may fill
His people, and the people be filled with their God, while God
shall be all in all, Himself their reward in peace who is their
strength in war. Therefore, when it is said in the words of
Nathan, "And the Lord will tell thee what an house thou
shalt build for Him,"<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> it is afterwards said in the words of
David, "For Thou, Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hast opened
the ear of Thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
For this house is built both by us through living well, and by
God through helping us to live well; for "except the Lord
build the house, they labour in vain that build it."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> And
when the final dedication of this house shall take place, then
what God here says by Nathan shall be fulfilled, "And I
will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant him,
and he shall dwell apart, and shall be troubled no more; and
the son of iniquity shall not humble him any more, as from
the beginning, from the days when I appointed judges over my
people Israel."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether the truth of this promised peace can be ascribed to those times
passed away under Solomon.</i></p>

<p>Whoever hopes for this so great good in this world, and
in this earth, his wisdom is but folly. Can any one think it
was fulfilled in the peace of Solomon's reign? Scripture certainly
commends that peace with excellent praise as a shadow
of that which is to come. But this opinion is to be vigilantly
opposed, since after it is said, "And the son of iniquity shall
not humble him any more," it is immediately added, "as from
the beginning, from the days in which I appointed judges
over my people Israel."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> For the judges were appointed over
that people from the time when they received the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
promise, before kings had begun to be there. And certainly
the son of iniquity, that is, the foreign enemy, humbled him
through periods of time in which we read that peace alternated
with wars; and in that period longer times of peace are
found than Solomon had, who reigned forty years. For under
that judge who is called Ehud there were eighty years of
peace.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Be it far from us, therefore, that we should believe
the times of Solomon are predicted in this promise, much less
indeed those of any other king whatever. For none other of
them reigned in such great peace as he; nor did that nation
ever at all hold that kingdom so as to have no anxiety lest it
should be subdued by enemies: for in the very great mutability
of human affairs such great security is never given to
any people, that it should not dread invasions hostile to this
life. Therefore the place of this promised peaceful and secure
habitation is eternal, and of right belongs eternally to Jerusalem
the free mother, where the genuine people of Israel
shall be: for this name is interpreted "Seeing God;" in the
desire of which reward a pious life is to be led through faith
in this miserable pilgrimage.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of David's concern in the writing of the Psalms.</i></p>

<p>In the progress of the city of God through the ages, therefore,
David first reigned in the earthly Jerusalem as a shadow
of that which was to come. Now David was a man skilled
in songs, who dearly loved musical harmony, not with a
vulgar delight, but with a believing disposition, and by it
served his God, who is the true God, by the mystical representation
of a great thing. For the rational and well-ordered
concord of diverse sounds in harmonious variety suggests the
compact unity of the well-ordered city. Then almost all his
prophecy is in psalms, of which a hundred and fifty are contained
in what we call the Book of Psalms, of which some
will have it those only were made by David which are inscribed
with his name. But there are also some who think
none of them were made by him except those which are
marked "Of David;" but those which have in the title "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
David" have been made by others who assumed his person.
Which opinion is refuted by the voice of the Saviour
Himself in the Gospel, when He says that David himself
by the Spirit said Christ was his Lord; for the 110th Psalm
begins thus, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my
right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> And
truly that very psalm, like many more, has in the title, not
"of David," but "for David." But those seem to me to hold
the more credible opinion, who ascribe to him the authorship
of all these hundred and fifty psalms, and think that he prefixed
to some of them the names even of other men, who
prefigured something pertinent to the matter, but chose to
have no man's name in the titles of the rest, just as God
inspired him in the management of this variety, which,
although dark, is not meaningless. Neither ought it to move
one not to believe this, that the names of some prophets who
lived long after the times of king David are read in the
inscriptions of certain psalms in that book, and that the
things said there seem to be spoken as it were by them.
Nor was the prophetic Spirit unable to reveal to king David,
when he prophesied, even these names of future prophets, so
that he might prophetically sing something which should suit
their persons; just as it was revealed to a certain prophet
that king Josiah should arise and reign after more than three
hundred years, who predicted his future deeds also along with
his name.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Whether all the things prophesied in the Psalms concerning Christ and His
Church should be taken up in the text of this work.</i></p>

<p>And now I see it may be expected of me that I shall open
up in this part of this book what David may have prophesied
in the Psalms concerning the Lord Jesus Christ or His
Church. But although I have already done so in one instance,
I am prevented from doing as that expectation seems
to demand, rather by the abundance than the scarcity of
matter. For the necessity of shunning prolixity forbids my
setting down all things; yet I fear lest if I select some I shall
appear to many, who know these things, to have passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the more necessary. Besides, the proof that is adduced ought
to be supported by the context of the whole psalm, so that
at least there may be nothing against it if everything does
not support it; lest we should seem, after the fashion of the
centos, to gather for the thing we wish, as it were verses out
of a grand poem, what shall be found to have been written
not about it, but about some other and widely different thing.
But ere this could be pointed out in each psalm, the whole
of it must be expounded; and how great a work that would
be, the volumes of others, as well as our own, in which we
have done it, show well enough. Let him then who will,
or can, read these volumes, and he will find out how many
and great things David, at once king and prophet, has prophesied
concerning Christ and His Church, to wit, concerning
the King and the city which He has built.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the things pertaining to Christ and the Church, said either openly or
tropically in the</i> 45<i>th Psalm.</i></p>

<p>For whatever direct and manifest prophetic utterances there
may be about anything, it is necessary that those which are
tropical should be mingled with them; which, chiefly on
account of those of slower understanding, thrust upon the
more learned the laborious task of clearing up and expounding
them. Some of them, indeed, on the very first blush, as
soon as they are spoken, exhibit Christ and the Church,
although some things in them that are less intelligible remain
to be expounded at leisure. We have an example of this
in that same Book of Psalms: "My heart bubbled up a good
matter: I utter my words to the king. My tongue is the pen
of a scribe, writing swiftly. Thy form is beautiful beyond the
sons of men; grace is poured out in Thy lips: therefore God
hath blessed Thee for evermore. Gird Thy sword about Thy
thigh, O Most Mighty. With Thy goodliness and Thy beauty
go forward, proceed prosperously, and reign, because of Thy
truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and Thy right hand
shall lead Thee forth wonderfully. Thy sharp arrows are most
powerful. The people shall fall under Thee: in the heart of
the King's enemies. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
a rod of direction is the rod of Thy kingdom. Thou hast
loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity: therefore God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of exultation above
Thy fellows. Myrrh and drops, and cassia from Thy vestments,
from the houses of ivory: out of which the daughters
of kings have delighted Thee in Thine honour."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Who is there,
no matter how slow, but must here recognise Christ whom
we preach, and in whom we believe, if he hears that He
is God, whose throne is for ever and ever, and that He is
anointed by God, as God indeed anoints, not with a visible,
but with a spiritual and intelligible chrism? For who is so
untaught in this religion, or so deaf to its far and wide spread
fame, as not to know that Christ is named from this chrism,
that is, from this anointing? But when it is acknowledged
that this King is Christ, let each one who is already subject to
Him who reigns because of truth, meekness, and righteousness,
inquire at his leisure into these other things that are here
said tropically: how His form is beautiful beyond the sons
of men, with a certain beauty that is the more to be loved
and admired the less it is corporeal; and what His sword,
arrows, and other things of that kind may be, which are set
down, not properly, but tropically.</p>

<p>Then let him look upon His Church, joined to her so great
Husband in spiritual marriage and divine love, of which it is
said in these words which follow, "The queen stood upon
Thy right hand in gold-embroidered vestments, girded about
with variety. Hearken, O daughter, and look, and incline
thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father's house.
Because the King hath greatly desired thy beauty; for He is
the Lord thy God. And the daughters of Tyre shall worship
Him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat Thy
face. The daughter of the King has all her glory within, in
golden fringes, girded about with variety. The virgins shall
be brought after her to the King: her neighbours shall be
brought to Thee. They shall be brought with gladness and
exultation: they shall be led into the temple of the King.
Instead of thy fathers, sons shall be born to thee: thou shalt
establish them as princes over all the earth. They shall be
mindful of thy name in every generation and descent. Therefore
shall the people acknowledge thee for evermore, even for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> I do not think any one is so stupid as to
believe that some poor woman is here praised and described,
as the spouse, to wit, of Him to whom it is said, "Thy throne,
O God, is for ever and ever: a rod of direction is the rod of
Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity:
therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the
oil of exultation above Thy fellows;"<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> that is, plainly, Christ
above Christians. For these are His fellows, out of the unity
and concord of whom in all nations that queen is formed,
as it is said of her in another psalm, "The city of the great
King."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The same is Sion spiritually, which name in Latin
is interpreted <i>speculatio</i> (discovery); for she descries the
great good of the world to come, because her attention is
directed thither. In the same way she is also Jerusalem
spiritually, of which we have already said many things. Her
enemy is the city of the devil, Babylon, which is interpreted
"confusion." Yet out of this Babylon this queen is in all
nations set free by regeneration, and passes from the worst
to the best King,&mdash;that is, from the devil to Christ. Wherefore
it is said to her, "Forget thy people and thy father's
house." Of this impious city those also are a portion who
are Israelites only in the flesh and not by faith, enemies also
of this great King Himself, and of His queen. For Christ,
having come to them, and been slain by them, has the more
become the King of others, whom He did not see in the flesh.
Whence our King Himself says through the prophecy of a
certain psalm, "Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions
of the people; Thou wilt make me head of the nations. A
people whom I have not known hath served me: in the hearing
of the ear it hath obeyed me."<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Therefore this people of
the nations, which Christ did not know in His bodily presence,
yet has believed in that Christ as announced to it; so that it
might be said of it with good reason, "In the hearing of the
ear it hath obeyed me," for "faith is by hearing."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> This
people, I say, added to those who are the true Israelites both
by the flesh and by faith, is the city of God, which has
brought forth Christ Himself according to the flesh, since He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
was in these Israelites only. For thence came the Virgin
Mary, in whom Christ assumed flesh that He might be man.
Of which city another psalm says, "Mother Sion, shall a man
say, and the man is made in her, and the Highest Himself
hath founded her."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Who is this Highest, save God? And
thus Christ, who is God, before He became man through Mary
in that city, Himself founded it by the patriarchs and prophets.
As therefore was said by prophecy so long before to this queen,
the city of God, what we already can see fulfilled, "Instead
of thy fathers, sons are born to thee; thou shalt make them
princes over all the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> so out of her sons truly are set
up even her fathers [princes] through all the earth, when the
people, coming together to her, confess to her with the confession
of eternal praise for ever and ever. Beyond doubt,
whatever interpretation is put on what is here expressed
somewhat darkly in figurative language, ought to be in agreement
with these most manifest things.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of those things in the</i> 110<i>th Psalm which relate to the priesthood of Christ,
and in the</i> 22<i>d to His passion.</i></p>

<p>Just as in that psalm also where Christ is most openly
proclaimed as Priest, even as He is here as King, "The Lord
said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> That Christ sits on the right
hand of God the Father is believed, not seen; that His enemies
also are put under His feet doth not yet appear; it is
being done, [therefore] it will appear at last: yea, this is now
believed, afterward it shall be seen. But what follows, "The
Lord will send forth the rod of Thy strength out of Sion, and
rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies,"<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> is so clear, that to
deny it would imply not merely unbelief and mistake, but
downright impudence. And even enemies must certainly
confess that out of Sion has been sent the law of Christ which
we call the gospel, and acknowledge as the rod of His strength.
But that He rules in the midst of His enemies, these same
enemies among whom He rules themselves bear witness,
gnashing their teeth and consuming away, and having power
to do nothing against Him. Then what he says a little after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
"The Lord hath sworn and will not repent,"<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> by which words
He intimates that what He adds is immutable, "Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek,"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> who is permitted
to doubt of whom these things are said, seeing that
now there is nowhere a priesthood and sacrifice after the
order of Aaron, and everywhere men offer under Christ as the
Priest, which Melchizedek showed when he blessed Abraham?
Therefore to these manifest things are to be referred, when
rightly understood, those things in the same psalm that are set
down a little more obscurely, and we have already made known
in our popular sermons how these things are to be rightly understood.
So also in that where Christ utters through prophecy
the humiliation of His passion, saying, "They pierced my
hands and feet; they counted all my bones. Yea, they looked
and stared at me."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> By which words he certainly meant His
body stretched out on the cross, with the hands and feet pierced
and perforated by the striking through of the nails, and that
He had in that way made Himself a spectacle to those who
looked and stared. And he adds, "They parted my garments
among them, and over my vesture they cast lots."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> How
this prophecy has been fulfilled the Gospel history narrates.
Then, indeed, the other things also which are said there less
openly are rightly understood when they agree with those
which shine with so great clearness; especially because those
things also which we do not believe as past, but survey as
present, are beheld by the whole world, being now exhibited
just as they are read of in this very psalm as predicted so
long before. For it is there said a little after, "All the ends
of the earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all
the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him; for the
kingdom is the Lord's, and He shall rule the nations."</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the</i> 3<i>d</i>, 41<i>st</i>, 15<i>th</i>, <i>and</i> 68<i>th Psalms, in which the death and resurrection
of the Lord are prophesied.</i></p>

<p>About His resurrection also the oracles of the Psalms are
by no means silent. For what else is it that is sung in His
person in the 3d Psalm, "I laid me down and took a sleep,
[and] I awaked, for the Lord shall sustain me?"<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
perchance any one so stupid as to believe that the prophet
chose to point it out to us as something great that He had
slept and risen up, unless that sleep had been death, and that
awaking the resurrection, which behoved to be thus prophesied
concerning Christ? For in the 41st Psalm also it is
shown much more clearly, where in the person of the Mediator,
in the usual way, things are narrated as if past which were
prophesied as yet to come, since these things which were yet
to come were in the predestination and foreknowledge of God
as if they were done, because they were certain. He says,
"Mine enemies speak evil of me; When shall he die, and his
name perish? And if he came in to see me, his heart spake
vain things: he gathered iniquity to himself. He went out
of doors, and uttered it all at once. Against me all mine
enemies whisper together: against me do they devise evil.
They have planned an unjust thing against me. Shall not
he that sleeps also rise again?"<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> These words are certainly
so set down here that he may be understood to say nothing
else than if he said, Shall not He that died recover life again?
The previous words clearly show that His enemies have meditated
and planned His death, and that this was executed by
him who came in to see, and went out to betray. But to
whom does not Judas here occur, who, from being His disciple,
became His betrayer? Therefore because they were
about to do what they had plotted,&mdash;that is, were about to
kill Him,&mdash;he, to show them that with useless malice they
were about to kill Him who should rise again, so adds this
verse, as if he said, What vain thing are you doing? What
will be your crime will be my sleep. "Shall not He that
sleeps also rise again?" And yet he indicates in the following
verses that they should not commit so great an impiety
with impunity, saying, "Yea, the man of my peace in whom
I trusted, who ate my bread, hath enlarged the heel over
me;"<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> that is, hath trampled me under foot. "But Thou," he
saith, "O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
may requite them."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Who can now deny this who sees the
Jews, after the passion and resurrection of Christ, utterly
rooted up from their abodes by warlike slaughter and destruction?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
For, being slain by them, He has risen again, and
has requited them meanwhile by temporary discipline, save
that for those who are not corrected He keeps it in store for
the time when He shall judge the quick and the dead.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> For
the Lord Jesus Himself, in pointing out that very man to the
apostles as His betrayer, quoted this very verse of this psalm,
and said it was fulfilled in Himself: "He that ate my bread
enlarged the heel over me." But what he says, "In whom I
trusted," does not suit the head but the body. For the
Saviour Himself was not ignorant of him concerning whom
He had already said before, "One of you is a devil."<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> But
He is wont to assume the person of His members, and to
ascribe to Himself what should be said of them, because the
head and the body is one Christ;<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> whence that saying in the
Gospel, "I was an hungered, and ye gave me to eat."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Expounding
which, He says, "Since ye did it to one of the least
of mine, ye did it to me."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Therefore He said that He had
trusted, because His disciples then had trusted concerning
Judas; for he was numbered with the apostles.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>But the Jews do not expect that the Christ whom they
expect will die; therefore they do not think ours to be Him
whom the law and the prophets announced, but feign to
themselves I know not whom of their own, exempt from the
suffering of death. Therefore, with wonderful emptiness and
blindness, they contend that the words we have set down
signify, not death and resurrection, but sleep and awaking
again. But the 16th Psalm also cries to them, "Therefore
my heart is jocund, and my tongue hath exulted; moreover,
my flesh also shall rest in hope: for Thou wilt not leave my
soul in hell; neither wilt Thou give Thine Holy One to see
corruption."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Who but He that rose again the third day
could say His flesh had rested in this hope; that His soul,
not being left in hell, but speedily returning to it, should
revive it, that it should not be corrupted as corpses are wont
to be, which they can in no wise say of David the prophet and
king? The 68th Psalm also cries out, "Our God is the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of salvation: even of the Lord the exit was by death."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> What
could be more openly said? For the God of salvation is the
Lord Jesus, which is interpreted Saviour, or Healing One. For
this reason this name was given, when it was said before He was
born of the virgin: "Thou shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt
call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their
sins."<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Because His blood was shed for the remission of their
sins, it behoved Him to have no other exit from this life than
death. Therefore, when it had been said, "Our God is the God
of salvation," immediately it was added, "Even of the Lord the
exit was by death," in order to show that we were to be saved
by His dying. But that saying is marvellous, "Even of the
Lord," as if it was said, Such is that life of mortals, that not
even the Lord Himself could go out of it otherwise save
through death.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the</i> 69<i>th Psalm, in which the obstinate unbelief of the Jews is
declared.</i></p>

<p>But when the Jews will not in the least yield to the testimonies
of this prophecy, which are so manifest, and are also
brought by events to so clear and certain a completion, certainly
that is fulfilled in them which is written in that psalm
which here follows. For when the things which pertain to
His passion are prophetically spoken there also in the person,
of Christ, that is mentioned which is unfolded in the Gospel:
"They gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar for drink."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> And as it were after such a feast
and dainties in this way given to Himself, presently He
brings in [these words]: "Let their table become a trap before
them, and a retribution, and an offence: let their eyes be
dimmed that they see not, and their back be always bowed
down,"<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> etc. Which things are not spoken as wished for,
but are predicted under the prophetic form of wishing. What
wonder, then, if those whose eyes are dimmed that they see
not do not see these manifest things? What wonder if
those do not look up at heavenly things whose back is always
bowed down that they may grovel among earthly things?
For these words transferred from the body signify mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
faults. Let these things which have been said about the
Psalms, that is, about king David's prophecy, suffice, that we
may keep within some bound. But let those readers excuse us
who knew them all before; and let them not complain about
those perhaps stronger proofs which they know or think I

<p>20. <i>Of David's reign and merit; and of his son Solomon, and that prophecy
relating to Christ which is found either in those books which are joined to
those written by him, or in those which are indubitably his.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>David therefore reigned in the earthly Jerusalem, a son
of the heavenly Jerusalem, much praised by the divine testimony;
for even his faults are overcome by great piety, through
the most salutary humility of his repentance, that he is altogether
one of those of whom he himself says, "Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
After him Solomon his son reigned over the same whole people,
who, as was said before, began to reign while his father was
still alive. This man, after good beginnings, made a bad end.
For indeed "prosperity, which wears out the minds of the wise,"<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
hurt him more than that wisdom profited him, which even
yet is and shall hereafter be renowned, and was then praised
far and wide. He also is found to have prophesied in his
books, of which three are received as of canonical authority,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. But it has
been customary to ascribe to Solomon other two, of which one
is called Wisdom, the other Ecclesiasticus, on account of some
resemblance of style,&mdash;but the more learned have no doubt
that they are not his; yet of old the Church, especially
the Western, received them into authority,&mdash;in the one of
which, called the Wisdom of Solomon, the passion of Christ
is most openly prophesied. For indeed His impious murderers
are quoted as saying, "Let us lie in wait for the
righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and contrary to our
works; and he upbraideth us with our transgressions of the
law, and objecteth to our disgrace the transgressions of our
education. He professeth to have the knowledge of God, and
he calleth himself the Son of God. He was made to reprove
our thoughts. He is grievous for us even to behold; for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
life is unlike other men's, and his ways are different. We
are esteemed of him as counterfeits; and he abstaineth from
our ways as from filthiness. He extols the latter end of the
righteous; and glorieth that he hath God for his Father. Let
us see, therefore, if his words be true; and let us try what
shall happen to him, and we shall know what shall be the
end of him. For if the righteous be the Son of God, He will
undertake for him, and deliver him out of the hand of those
that are against him. Let us put him to the question with
contumely and torture, that we may know his reverence, and
prove his patience. Let us condemn him to the most shameful
death; for by His own sayings He shall be respected.
These things did they imagine, and were mistaken; for their
own malice hath quite blinded them."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> But in Ecclesiasticus
the future faith of the nations is predicted in this manner:
"Have mercy upon us, O God, Ruler of all, and send Thy fear
upon all the nations: lift up Thine hand over the strange
nations, and let them see Thy power. As Thou wast sanctified
in us before them, so be Thou sanctified in them before
us, and let them acknowledge Thee, according as we also have
acknowledged Thee; for there is not a God beside Thee, O
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> We see this prophecy in the form of a wish and
prayer fulfilled through Jesus Christ. But the things which
are not written in the canon of the Jews cannot be quoted
against their contradictions with so great validity.</p>

<p>But as regards those three books which it is evident are
Solomon's, and held canonical by the Jews, to show what of
this kind may be found in them pertaining to Christ and the
Church demands a laborious discussion, which, if now entered
on, would lengthen this work unduly. Yet what we read in
the Proverbs of impious men saying, "Let us unrighteously
hide in the earth the righteous man; yea, let us swallow him
up alive as hell, and let us take away his memory from the
earth: let us seize his precious possession,"<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> is not so obscure
that it may not be understood, without laborious exposition,
of Christ and His possession the Church. Indeed, the gospel
parable about the wicked husbandmen shows that our Lord
Jesus Himself said something like it: "This is the heir; come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> In like
manner also that passage in this same book, on which we have
already touched<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> when we were speaking of the barren woman
who hath born seven, must soon after it was uttered have
come to be understood of only Christ and the Church by those
who knew that Christ was the Wisdom of God. "Wisdom
hath builded her an house, and hath set up seven pillars; she
hath sacrificed her victims, she hath mingled her wine in the
bowl; she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent her
servants summoning to the bowl with excellent proclamation,
saying, Who is simple, let him turn aside to me. And
to the void of sense she hath said, Come, eat of my bread,
and drink of the wine which I have mingled for you."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Here
certainly we perceive that the Wisdom of God, that is, the
Word co-eternal with the Father, hath builded Him an house,
even a human body in the virgin womb, and hath subjoined
the Church to it as members to a head, hath slain the martyrs
as victims, hath furnished a table with wine and bread, where
appears also the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, and
hath called the simple and the void of sense, because, as saith
the apostle, "He hath chosen the weak things of this world
that He might confound the things which are mighty."<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Yet
to these weak ones she saith what follows, "Forsake simplicity,
that ye may live; and seek prudence, that ye may have
life."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> But to be made partakers of this table is itself to
begin to have life. For when he says in another book, which
is called Ecclesiastes, "There is no good for a man, except
that he should eat and drink,"<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> what can he be more credibly
understood to say, than what belongs to the participation of
this table which the Mediator of the New Testament Himself,
the Priest after the order of Melchizedek, furnishes with His
own body and blood? For that sacrifice has succeeded all
the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which were slain as a
shadow of that which was to come; wherefore also we recognise
the voice in the 40th Psalm as that of the same
Mediator speaking through prophesy, "Sacrifice and offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Thou didst not desire; but a body hast Thou perfected for me."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Because, instead of all these sacrifices and oblations, His body
is offered, and is served up to the partakers of it. For that
this Ecclesiastes, in this sentence about eating and drinking,
which he often repeats, and very much commends, does not
savour the dainties of carnal pleasures, is made plain enough
when he says, "It is better to go into the house of mourning
than to go into the house of feasting."<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> And a little after
He says, "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
and the heart of the simple in the house of feasting."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> But
I think that more worthy of quotation from this book which
relates to both cities, the one of the devil, the other of Christ,
and to their kings, the devil and Christ: "Woe to thee, O land,"
he says, "when thy king is a youth, and thy princes eat in
the morning! Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the
son of nobles, and thy princes eat in season, in fortitude, and
not in confusion!"<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> He has called the devil a youth, because
of the folly and pride, and rashness and unruliness, and other
vices which are wont to abound at that age; but Christ is the
Son of nobles, that is, of the holy patriarchs, of those belonging
to the free city, of whom He was begotten in the flesh.
The princes of that and other cities are eaters in the morning,
that is, before the suitable hour, because they do not expect
the seasonable felicity, which is the true, in the world to come,
desiring to be speedily made happy with the renown of this
world, but the princes of the city of Christ patiently wait
for the time of a blessedness that is not fallacious. This is
expressed by the words, "in fortitude, and not in confusion,"
because hope does not deceive them, of which the apostle
says, "But hope maketh not ashamed."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> A psalm also saith,
"For they that hope in Thee shall not be put to shame."<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
But now the Song of Songs is a certain spiritual pleasure of
holy minds, in the marriage of that King and Queen-city, that
is, Christ and the Church. But this pleasure is wrapped up
in allegorical veils, that the Bridegroom may be more ardently
desired, and more joyfully unveiled, and may appear; to whom
it is said in this same song, "Equity hath delighted Thee;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>

We pass over many things in silence, in our desire to finish
this work.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the kings after Solomon, both in Judah and Israel.</i></p>

<p>The other kings of the Hebrews after Solomon are scarcely
found to have prophesied, through certain enigmatic words or
actions of theirs, what may pertain to Christ and the Church,
either in Judah or Israel; for so were the parts of that
people styled, when, on account of Solomon's offence, from the
time of Rehoboam his son, who succeeded him in the kingdom,
it was divided by God as a punishment. The ten tribes,
indeed, which Jeroboam the servant of Solomon received,
being appointed the king in Samaria, were distinctively called
Israel, although this had been the name of that whole people;
but the two tribes, namely, of Judah and Benjamin, which for
David's sake, lest the kingdom should be wholly wrenched
from his race, remained subject to the city of Jerusalem,
were called Judah, because that was the tribe whence David
sprang. But Benjamin, the other tribe which, as was said,
belonged to the same kingdom, was that whence Saul sprang
before David. But these two tribes together, as was said,
were called Judah, and were distinguished by this name from
Israel, which was the distinctive title of the ten tribes under
their own king. For the tribe of Levi, because it was the
priestly one, bound to the servitude of God, not of the kings,
was reckoned the thirteenth. For Joseph, one of the twelve
sons of Israel, did not, like the others, form one tribe, but two,
Ephraim and Manasseh. Yet the tribe of Levi also belonged
more to the kingdom of Jerusalem, where was the temple of
God whom it served. On the division of the people, therefore,
Rehoboam, son of Solomon, reigned in Jerusalem as the
first king of Judah, and Jeroboam, servant of Solomon, in
Samaria as king of Israel. And when Rehoboam wished as
a tyrant to pursue that separated part with war, the people
were prohibited from fighting with their brethren by God, who
told them through a prophet that He had done this; whence
it appeared that in this matter there had been no sin either
of the king or people of Israel, but the accomplished will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
God the avenger. When this was known, both parts settled
down peaceably, for the division made was not religious but
political.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>22. <i>Of Jeroboam, who profaned the people put under him by the impiety of
idolatry, amid which, however, God did not cease to inspire the prophets,
and to guard many from the crime of idolatry.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But Jeroboam king of Israel, with perverse mind, not believing
in God, whom he had proved true in promising and
giving him the kingdom, was afraid lest, by coming to the
temple of God which was in Jerusalem, where, according to
the divine law, that whole nation was to come in order to
sacrifice, the people should be seduced from him, and return
to David's line as the seed royal; and set up idolatry in
his kingdom, and with horrible impiety beguiled the people,
ensnaring them to the worship of idols with himself. Yet
God did not altogether cease to reprove by the prophets, not
only that king, but also his successors and imitators in his
impiety, and the people too. For there the great and illustrious
prophets Elijah and Elisha his disciple arose, who also
did many wonderful works. Even there, when Elijah said,
"O Lord, they have slain Thy prophets, they have digged
down Thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my
life," it was answered that seven thousand men were there
who had not bowed the knee to Baal.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Of the varying condition of both the Hebrew kingdoms, until the people of
both were at different times led into captivity, Judah being afterwards
recalled into his kingdom, which finally passed into the power of the
Romans.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>So also in the kingdom of Judah pertaining to Jerusalem
prophets were not lacking even in the times of succeeding
kings, just as it pleased God to send them, either for the
prediction of what was needful, or for correction of sin and
instruction in righteousness;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> for there, too, although far less
than in Israel, kings arose who grievously offended God by
their impieties, and, along with their people, who were like
them, were smitten with moderate scourges. The no small
merits of the pious kings there are praised indeed. But we
read that in Israel the kings were, some more, others less, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
all wicked. Each part, therefore, as the divine providence
either ordered or permitted, was both lifted up by prosperity
and weighed down by adversity of various kinds; and it was
afflicted not only by foreign, but also by civil wars with each
other, in order that by certain existing causes the mercy or
anger of God might be manifested; until, by His growing indignation,
that whole nation was by the conquering Chaldeans
not only overthrown in its abode, but also for the most part
transported to the lands of the Assyrians,&mdash;first, that part of
the thirteen tribes called Israel, but afterwards Judah also,
when Jerusalem and that most noble temple was cast down,&mdash;in
which lands it rested seventy years in captivity. Being
after that time sent forth thence, they rebuilt the overthrown
temple. And although very many stayed in the lands of the
strangers, yet the kingdom no longer had two separate parts,
with different kings over each, but in Jerusalem there was
one prince over them; and at certain times, from every direction
wherever they were, and from whatever place they could,
they all came to the temple of God which was there. Yet
not even then were they without foreign enemies and conquerors;
yea, Christ found them tributaries of the Romans.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the prophets, who either were the last among the Jews, or whom the
gospel history reports about the time of Christ's nativity.</i></p>

<p>But in that whole time after they returned from Babylon,
after Malachi, Haggai, and Zechariah, who then prophesied,
and Ezra, they had no prophets down to the time of the
Saviour's advent except another Zechariah, the father of John,
and Elisabeth his wife, when the nativity of Christ was already
close at hand; and when He was already born, Simeon the
aged, and Anna a widow, and now very old; and, last of all,
John himself, who, being a young man, did not predict that
Christ, now a young man, was to come, but by prophetic knowledge
pointed Him out although unknown; for which reason
the Lord Himself says, "The law and the prophets were until
John."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But the prophesying of these five is made known to
us in the gospel, where the virgin mother of our Lord herself
is also found to have prophesied before John. But this
prophecy of theirs the wicked Jews do not receive; but those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
innumerable persons received it who from them believed the
gospel. For then truly Israel was divided in two, by that
division which was foretold by Samuel the prophet to king
Saul as immutable. But even the reprobate Jews hold
Malachi, Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra as the last received into
canonical authority. For there are also writings of these, as
of others, who being but a very few in the great multitude
of prophets, have written those books which have obtained
canonical authority, of whose predictions it seems good to me
to put in this work some which pertain to Christ and His
Church; and this, by the Lord's help, shall be done more conveniently
in the following book, that we may not further
burden this one, which is already too long.</p>

ALLUDES TO THE ORACLES REGARDING CHRIST, BOTH THOSE UTTERED BY

<p class="center">1. <i>Of those things down to the times of the Saviour which have been discussed
in the seventeen books.</i></p>

<p>I promised to write of the rise, progress, and appointed
end of the two cities, one of which is God's, the other
this world's, in which, so far as mankind is concerned, the
former is now a stranger. But first of all I undertook, so far
as His grace should enable me, to refute the enemies of the
city of God, who prefer their gods to Christ its founder, and
fiercely hate Christians with the most deadly malice. And
this I have done in the first ten books. Then, as regards my
threefold promise which I have just mentioned, I have treated
distinctly, in the four books which follow the tenth, of the
rise of both cities. After that, I have proceeded from the
first man down to the flood in one book, which is the fifteenth
of this work; and from that again down to Abraham our
work has followed both in chronological order. From the
patriarch Abraham down to the time of the Israelite kings, at
which we close our sixteenth book, and thence down to the
advent of Christ Himself in the flesh, to which period the
seventeenth book reaches, the city of God appears from my
way of writing to have run its course alone; whereas it did
not run its course alone in this age, for both cities, in their
course amid mankind, certainly experienced chequered times
together just as from the beginning. But I did this in order
that, first of all, from the time when the promises of God
began to be more clear, down to the virgin birth of Him
in whom those things promised from the first were to be fulfilled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the course of that city which is God's might be made
more distinctly apparent, without interpolation of foreign
matter from the history of the other city, although down to
the revelation of the new covenant it ran its course, not in
light, but in shadow. Now, therefore, I think fit to do what I
passed by, and show, so far as seems necessary, how that other
city ran its course from the times of Abraham, so that attentive
readers may compare the two.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the kings and times of the earthly city which were synchronous with the
times of the saints, reckoning from the rise of Abraham.</i></p>

<p>The society of mortals spread abroad through the earth
everywhere, and in the most diverse places, although bound
together by a certain fellowship of our common nature, is yet
for the most part divided against itself, and the strongest
oppress the others, because all follow after their own interests
and lusts, while what is longed for either suffices for none,
or not for all, because it is not the very thing. For the vanquished
succumb to the victorious, preferring any sort of peace
and safety to freedom itself; so that they who chose to die
rather than be slaves have been greatly wondered at. For in
almost all nations the very voice of nature somehow proclaims,
that those who happen to be conquered should choose rather
to be subject to their conquerors than to be killed by all kinds
of warlike destruction. This does not take place without the
providence of God, in whose power it lies that any one either
subdues or is subdued in war; that some are endowed with
kingdoms, others made subject to kings. Now, among the
very many kingdoms of the earth into which, by earthly interest
or lust, society is divided (which we call by the general
name of the city of this world), we see that two, settled and
kept distinct from each other both in time and place, have
grown far more famous than the rest, first that of the Assyrians,
then that of the Romans. First came the one, then the other.
The former arose in the east, and, immediately on its close, the
latter in the west. I may speak of other kingdoms and other
kings as appendages of these.</p>

<p>Ninus, then, who succeeded his father Belus, the first king
of Assyria, was already the second king of that kingdom when
Abraham was born in the land of the Chaldees. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
also at that time a very small kingdom of Sicyon, with which,
as from an ancient date, that most universally learned man
Marcus Varro begins, in writing of the Roman race. For
from these kings of Sicyon he passes to the Athenians, from
them to the Latins, and from these to the Romans. Yet very
little is related about these kingdoms, before the foundation of
Rome, in comparison with that of Assyria. For although
even Sallust, the Roman historian, admits that the Athenians
were very famous in Greece, yet he thinks they were greater
in fame than in fact. For in speaking of them he says,
"The deeds of the Athenians, as I think, were very great and
magnificent, but yet somewhat less than reported by fame.
But because writers of great genius arose among them, the
deeds of the Athenians were celebrated throughout the world
as very great. Thus the virtue of those who did them was
held to be as great as men of transcendent genius could represent
it to be by the power of laudatory words."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> This city
also derived no small glory from literature and philosophy, the
study of which chiefly flourished there. But as regards empire,
none in the earliest times was greater than the Assyrian,
or so widely extended. For when Ninus the son of Belus was
king, he is reported to have subdued the whole of Asia, even
to the boundaries of Libya, which as to number is called the
third part, but as to size is found to be the half of the whole
world. The Indians in the eastern regions were the only
people over whom he did not reign; but after his death Semiramis
his wife made war on them. Thus it came to pass
that all the people and kings in those countries were subject
to the kingdom and authority of the Assyrians, and did whatever
they were commanded. Now Abraham was born in that
kingdom among the Chaldees, in the time of Ninus. But
since Grecian affairs are much better known to us than
Assyrian, and those who have diligently investigated the antiquity
of the Roman nation's origin have followed the order of
time through the Greeks to the Latins, and from them to the
Romans, who themselves are Latins, we ought on this account,
where it is needful, to mention the Assyrian kings, that it may
appear how Babylon, like a first Rome, ran its course along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
with the city of God, which is a stranger in this world. But
the things proper for insertion in this work in comparing the
two cities, that is, the earthly and heavenly, ought to be taken
mostly from the Greek and Latin kingdoms, where Rome
herself is like a second Babylon.</p>

<p>At Abraham's birth, then, the second kings of Assyria and
Sicyon respectively were Ninus and Europs, the first having
been Belus and Ægialeus. But when God promised Abraham,
on his departure from Babylonia, that he should become a
great nation, and that in his seed all nations of the earth
should be blessed, the Assyrians had their seventh king, the
Sicyons their fifth; for the son of Ninus reigned among them
after his mother Semiramis, who is said to have been put to
death by him for attempting to defile him by incestuously
lying with him. Some think that she founded Babylon, and
indeed she may have founded it anew. But we have told, in
the sixteenth book, when or by whom it was founded. Now
the son of Ninus and Semiramis, who succeeded his mother
in the kingdom, is also called Ninus by some, but by others
Ninias, a patronymic word. Telexion then held the kingdom
of the Sicyons. In his reign times were quiet and joyful to
such a degree, that after his death they worshipped him as a
god by offering sacrifices and by celebrating games, which are
said to have been first instituted on this occasion.</p>

<p>3. <i>What kings reigned in Assyria and Sicyon when, according to the promise,
Isaac was born to Abraham in his hundredth year, and when the twins
Esau and Jacob were born of Rebecca to Isaac in his sixtieth year.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In his times also, by the promise of God, Isaac, the son of
Abraham, was born to his father when he was a hundred
years old, of Sarah his wife, who, being barren and old, had
already lost hope of issue. Aralius was then the fifth king
of the Assyrians. To Isaac himself, in his sixtieth year, were
born twin-sons, Esau and Jacob, whom Rebecca his wife bore
to him, their grandfather Abraham, who died on completing
a hundred and seventy years, being still alive, and reckoning
his hundred and sixtieth year.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> At that time there reigned
as the seventh kings,&mdash;among the Assyrians, that more ancient
Xerxes, who was also called Balæus; and among the Sicyons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Thuriachus, or, as some write his name, Thurimachus. The
kingdom of Argos, in which Inachus reigned first, arose in
the time of Abraham's grandchildren. And I must not
omit what Varro relates, that the Sicyons were also wont to
sacrifice at the tomb of their seventh king Thuriachus. In
the reign of Armamitres in Assyria and Leucippus in Sicyon
as the eighth kings, and of Inachus as the first in Argos, God
spoke to Isaac, and promised the same two things to him as
to his father,&mdash;namely, the land of Canaan to his seed, and
the blessing of all nations in his seed. These same things
were promised to his son, Abraham's grandson, who was at
first called Jacob, afterwards Israel, when Belocus was the
ninth king of Assyria, and Phoroneus, the son of Inachus,
reigned as the second king of Argos, Leucippus still continuing
king of Sicyon. In those times, under the Argive king
Phoroneus, Greece was made more famous by the institution
of certain laws and judges. On the death of Phoroneus, his
younger brother Phegous built a temple at his tomb, in which
he was worshipped as God, and oxen were sacrificed to him. I
believe they thought him worthy of so great honour, because
in his part of the kingdom (for their father had divided his
territories between them, in which they reigned during his
life) he had founded chapels for the worship of the gods, and
had taught them to measure time by months and years, and
to that extent to keep count and reckoning of events. Men
still uncultivated, admiring him for these novelties, either
fancied he was, or resolved that he should be made, a god
after his death. Io also is said to have been the daughter
of Inachus, who was afterwards called Isis, when she was
worshipped in Egypt as a great goddess; although others
write that she came as a queen out of Ethiopia, and because
she ruled extensively and justly, and instituted for her subjects
letters and many useful things, such divine honour was
given her there after she died, that if any one said she had
been human, he was charged with a capital crime.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the times of Jacob and his son Joseph.</i></p>

<p>In the reign of Balæus, the ninth king of Assyria, and
Mesappus, the eighth of Sicyon, who is said by some to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
been also called Cephisos (if indeed the same man had both
names, and those who put the other name in their writings
have not rather confounded him with another man), while
Apis was third king of Argos, Isaac died, a hundred and
eighty years old, and left his twin-sons a hundred and twenty
years old. Jacob, the younger of these, belonged to the
city of God about which we write (the elder being wholly
rejected), and had twelve sons, one of whom, called Joseph,
was sold by his brothers to merchants going down to Egypt,
while his grandfather Isaac was still alive. But when he
was thirty years of age, Joseph stood before Pharaoh, being
exalted out of the humiliation he endured, because, in divinely
interpreting the king's dreams, he foretold that there would
be seven years of plenty, the very rich abundance of which
would be consumed by seven other years of famine that
should follow. On this account the king made him ruler
over Egypt, liberating him from prison, into which he had
been thrown for keeping his chastity intact; for he bravely
preserved it from his mistress, who wickedly loved him, and
told lies to his weakly credulous master, and did not consent
to commit adultery with her, but fled from her, leaving his
garment in her hands when she laid hold of him. In the
second of the seven years of famine Jacob came down into
Egypt to his son with all he had, being a hundred and thirty
years old, as he himself said in answer to the king's question.
Joseph was then thirty-nine, if we add seven years of plenty
and two of famine to the thirty he reckoned when honoured
by the king.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of Apis king of Argos, whom the Egyptians called Serapis, and worshipped
with divine honours.</i></p>

<p>In these times Apis king of Argos crossed over into
Egypt in ships, and, on dying there, was made Serapis, the
chief god of all the Egyptians. Now Varro gives this very
ready reason why, after his death, he was called, not Apis, but
Serapis. The ark in which he was placed when dead, which
every one now calls a sarcophagus, was then called in Greek
&#963;&#959;&#961;&#8056;&#962;, and they began to worship him when buried in it before
his temple was built; and from Soros and Apis he was called
first [Sorosapis, or] Sorapis, and then Serapis, by changing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
letter, as easily happens. It was decreed regarding him also,
that whoever should say he had been a man should be capitally
punished. And since in every temple where Isis and
Serapis were worshipped there was also an image which, with
finger pressed on the lips, seemed to warn men to keep silence,
Varro thinks this signifies that it should be kept secret that
they had been human. But that bull which, with wonderful
folly, deluded Egypt nourished with abundant delicacies in
honour of him, was not called Serapis, but Apis, because they
worshipped him alive without a sarcophagus. On the death
of that bull, when they sought and found a calf of the same
colour,&mdash;that is, similarly marked with certain white spots,&mdash;they
believed it was something miraculous, and divinely provided
for them. Yet it was no great thing for the demons,
in order to deceive them, to show to a cow when she was
conceiving and pregnant the image of such a bull, which she
alone could see, and by it attract the breeding passion of the
mother, so that it might appear in a bodily shape in her
young, just as Jacob so managed with the spotted rods that
the sheep and goats were born spotted. For what men can
do with real colours and substances, the demons can very
easily do by showing unreal forms to breeding animals.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Who were kings of Argos, and of Assyria, when Jacob died in Egypt.</i></p>

<p>Apis, then, who died in Egypt, was not the king of Egypt,
but of Argos. He was succeeded by his son Argus, from
whose name the land was called Argos and the people Argives,
for under the earlier kings neither the place nor the nation
as yet had this name. While he then reigned over Argos,
and Eratus over Sicyon, and Balæus still remained king of
Assyria, Jacob died in Egypt a hundred and forty-seven years
old, after he had, when dying, blessed his sons and his grandsons
by Joseph, and prophesied most plainly of Christ, saying
in the blessing of Judah, "A prince shall not fail out of
Judah, nor a leader from his thighs, until those things come
which are laid up for him; and He is the expectation of the
nations."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> In the reign of Argus Greece began to use fruits,
and to have crops of corn in cultivated fields, the seed having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
been brought from other countries. Argus also began to be
accounted a god after his death, and was honoured with a
temple and sacrifices. This honour was conferred in his reign,
before being given to him, on a private individual for being
the first to yoke oxen in the plough. This was one Homogyrus,
who was struck by lightning.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Who were kings when Joseph died in Egypt.</i></p>

<p>In the reign of Mamitus, the twelfth king of Assyria, and
Plemnæus, the eleventh of Sicyon, while Argus still reigned
over the Argives, Joseph died in Egypt a hundred and ten
years old. After his death, the people of God, increasing
wonderfully, remained in Egypt a hundred and forty-five
years, in tranquillity at first, until those who knew Joseph were
dead. Afterward, through envy of their increase, and the
suspicion that they would at length gain their freedom, they
were oppressed with persecutions and the labours of intolerable
servitude, amid which, however, they still grew, being
multiplied with God-given fertility. During this period the
same kingdoms continued in Assyria and Greece.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Who were kings when Moses was born, and what gods began to be worshipped
then.</i></p>

<p>When Saphrus reigned as the fourteenth king of Assyria,
and Orthopolis as the twelfth of Sicyon, and Criasus as the
fifth of Argos, Moses was born in Egypt, by whom the
people of God were liberated from the Egyptian slavery, in
which they behoved to be thus tried that they might desire
the help of their Creator. Some have thought that Prometheus
lived during the reign of the kings now named. He
is reported to have formed men out of clay, because he was
esteemed the best teacher of wisdom; yet it does not appear
what wise men there were in his days. His brother Atlas is
said to have been a great astrologer; and this gave occasion
for the fable that he held up the sky, although the vulgar
opinion about his holding up the sky appears rather to have
been suggested by a high mountain named after him. Indeed,
from those times many other fabulous things began to
be invented in Greece; yet, down to Cecrops king of Athens,
in whose reign that city received its name, and in whose reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
God brought His people out of Egypt by Moses, only a few
dead heroes are reported to have been deified according to the
vain superstition of the Greeks. Among these were Melantomice,
the wife of king Criasus, and Phorbas their son, who
succeeded his father as sixth king of the Argives, and Iasus,
son of Triopas, their seventh king, and their ninth king,
Sthenelas, or Stheneleus, or Sthenelus,&mdash;for his name is given
differently by different authors. In those times also, Mercury,
the grandson of Atlas by his daughter Maia, is said to
have lived, according to the common report in books. He
was famous for his skill in many arts, and taught them to
men, for which they resolved to make him, and even believed
that he deserved to be, a god after death. Hercules is
said to have been later, yet belonging to the same period;
although some, whom I think mistaken, assign him an earlier
date than Mercury. But at whatever time they were born,
it is agreed among grave historians, who have committed these
ancient things to writing, that both were men, and that they
merited divine honours from mortals because they conferred
on them many benefits to make this life more pleasant to
them. Minerva was far more ancient than these; for she
is reported to have appeared in virgin age in the times of
Ogyges at the lake called Triton, from which she is also
styled Tritonia, the inventress truly of many works, and the
more readily believed to be a goddess because her origin was
so little known. For what is sung about her having sprung
from the head of Jupiter belongs to the region of poetry and
fable, and not to that of history and real fact. And historical
writers are not agreed when Ogyges flourished, in whose time
also a great flood occurred,&mdash;not that greatest one from which
no man escaped except those who could get into the ark, for
neither Greek nor Latin history knew of it, yet a greater
flood than that which happened afterward in Deucalion's
time. For Varro begins the book I have already mentioned
at this date, and does not propose to himself, as the starting-point
from which he may arrive at Roman affairs, anything
more ancient than the flood of Ogyges, that is, which happened
in the time of Ogyges. Now our writers of chronicles&mdash;first
Eusebius, and afterwards Jerome, who entirely follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
some earlier historians in this opinion&mdash;relate that the flood
of Ogyges happened more than three hundred years after,
during the reign of Phoroneus, the second king of Argos.
But whenever he may have lived, Minerva was already worshipped
as a goddess when Cecrops reigned in Athens, in
whose reign the city itself is reported to have been rebuilt
or founded.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>When the city of Athens was founded, and what reason Varro assigns for its
name.</i></p>

<p>Athens certainly derived its name from Minerva, who in
Greek is called &#7944;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#951;, and Varro points out the following
reason why it was so called. When an olive-tree suddenly
appeared there, and water burst forth in another place, these
prodigies moved the king to send to the Delphic Apollo to
inquire what they meant and what he should do. He answered
that the olive signified Minerva, the water Neptune,
and that the citizens had it in their power to name their
city as they chose, after either of these two gods whose signs
these were. On receiving this oracle, Cecrops convoked all
the citizens of either sex to give their vote, for it was then
the custom in those parts for the women also to take part in
public deliberations. When the multitude was consulted, the
men gave their votes for Neptune, the women for Minerva;
and as the women had a majority of one, Minerva conquered.
Then Neptune, being enraged, laid waste the lands of the
Athenians, by casting up the waves of the sea; for the
demons have no difficulty in scattering any waters more
widely. The same authority said, that to appease his wrath
the women should be visited by the Athenians with the threefold
punishment&mdash;that they should no longer have any vote;
that none of their children should be named after their
mothers; and that no one should call them Athenians. Thus
that city, the mother and nurse of liberal doctrines, and of
so many and so great philosophers, than whom Greece had
nothing more famous and noble, by the mockery of demons
about the strife of their gods, a male and female, and from
the victory of the female one through the women, received
the name of Athens; and, on being damaged by the vanquished
god, was compelled to punish the very victory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
victress, fearing the waters of Neptune more than the arms
of Minerva. For in the women who were thus punished,
Minerva, who had conquered, was conquered too, and could
not even help her voters so far that, although the right of
voting was henceforth lost, and the mothers could not give
their names to the children, they might at least be allowed to
be called Athenians, and to merit the name of that goddess
whom they had made victorious over a male god by giving
her their votes. What and how much could be said about
this, if we had not to hasten to other things in our discourse,
is obvious.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>What Varro reports about the term Areopagus, and about Deucalion's
flood.</i></p>

<p>Marcus Varro, however, is not willing to credit lying fables
against the gods, lest he should find something dishonouring
to their majesty; and therefore he will not admit that the
Areopagus, the place where the Apostle Paul disputed with
the Athenians, got this name because Mars, who in Greek is
called &#7948;&#961;&#951;&#962;, when he was charged with the crime of homicide,
and was judged by twelve gods in that field, was acquitted
by the sentence of six; because it was the custom,
when the votes were equal, to acquit rather than condemn.
Against this opinion, which is much most widely published,
he tries, from the notices of obscure books, to support
another reason for this name, lest the Athenians should be
thought to have called it Areopagus from the words "Mars" and
"field,"<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> as if it were the field of Mars, to the dishonour of the
gods, forsooth, from whom he thinks lawsuits and judgments
far removed. And he asserts that this which is said about
Mars is not less false than what is said about the three
goddesses, to wit, Juno, Minerva, and Venus, whose contest
for the palm of beauty, before Paris as judge, in order to obtain
the golden apple, is not only related, but is celebrated in
songs and dances amid the applause of the theatres, in plays
meant to please the gods who take pleasure in these crimes of
their own, whether real or fabled. Varro does not believe
these things, because they are incompatible with the nature
of the gods and of morality; and yet, in giving not a fabulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
but a historic reason for the name of Athens, he inserts in his
books the strife between Neptune and Minerva as to whose
name should be given to that city, which was so great that,
when they contended by the display of prodigies, even Apollo
dared not judge between them when consulted; but, in order to
end the strife of the gods, just as Jupiter sent the three goddesses
we have named to Paris, so he sent them to men, when
Minerva won by the vote, and yet was defeated by the punishment
of her own voters, for she was unable to confer the title
of Athenians on the women who were her friends, although she
could impose it on the men who were her opponents. In
these times, when Cranaos reigned at Athens as the successor
of Cecrops, as Varro writes, but, according to our Eusebius and
Jerome, while Cecrops himself still remained, the flood occurred
which is called Deucalion's, because it occurred chiefly
in those parts of the earth in which he reigned. But this
flood did not at all reach Egypt or its vicinity.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>When Moses led the people out of Egypt; and who were kings when his
successor Joshua the son of Nun died.</i></p>

<p>Moses led the people out of Egypt in the last time of
Cecrops king of Athens, when Ascatades reigned in Assyria,
Marathus in Sicyon, Triopas in Argos; and having led forth
the people, he gave them at Mount Sinai the law he received
from God, which is called the Old Testament, because it has
earthly promises, and because, through Jesus Christ, there
was to be a New Testament, in which the kingdom of heaven
should be promised. For the same order behoved to be
observed in this as is observed in each man who prospers
in God, according to the saying of the apostle, "That is not
first which is spiritual, but that which is natural," since, as
he says, and that truly, "The first man of the earth, is earthly;
the second man, from heaven, is heavenly."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Now Moses
ruled the people for forty years in the wilderness, and died a
hundred and twenty years old, after he had prophesied of
Christ by the types of carnal observances in the tabernacle,
priesthood, and sacrifices, and many other mystic ordinances.
Joshua the son of Nun succeeded Moses, and settled in the
land of promise the people he had brought in, having by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
divine authority conquered the people by whom it was
formerly possessed. He also died, after ruling the people
twenty-seven years after the death of Moses, when Amyntas
reigned in Assyria as the eighteenth king, Coracos as the sixteenth
in Sicyon, Danaos as the tenth in Argos, Ericthonius
as the fourth in Athens.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>12. <i>Of the rituals of false gods instituted by the kings of Greece in the period
from Israel's exodus from Egypt down to the death of Joshua the son
of Nun.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>During this period, that is, from Israel's exodus from Egypt
down to the death of Joshua the son of Nun, through whom
that people received the land of promise, rituals were instituted
to the false gods by the kings of Greece, which, by
stated celebration, recalled the memory of the flood, and of
men's deliverance from it, and of that troublous life they then
led in migrating to and fro between the heights and the
plains. For even the Luperci,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> when they ascend and descend
the sacred path, are said to represent the men who sought
the mountain summits because of the inundation of water,
and returned to the lowlands on its subsidence. In those
times, Dionysus, who was also called Father Liber, and was
esteemed a god after death, is said to have shown the vine
to his host in Attica. Then the musical games were instituted
for the Delphic Apollo, to appease his anger, through
which they thought the regions of Greece were afflicted with
barrenness, because they had not defended his temple which
Danaos burnt when he invaded those lands; for they were
warned by his oracle to institute these games. But king
Ericthonius first instituted games to him in Attica, and not to
him only, but also to Minerva, in which games the olive was
given as the prize to the victors, because they relate that
Minerva was the discoverer of that fruit, as Liber was of the
grape. In those years Europa is alleged to have been carried
off by Xanthus king of Crete (to whom we find some
give another name), and to have borne him Rhadamanthus,
Sarpedon, and Minos, who are more commonly reported to
have been the sons of Jupiter by the same woman. Now
those who worship such gods regard what we have said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Xanthus king of Crete as true history; but this about
Jupiter, which the poets sing, the theatres applaud, and the
people celebrate, as empty fable got up as a reason for games
to appease the deities, even with the false ascription of crimes
to them. In those times Hercules was held in honour in
Tyre, but that was not the same one as he whom we spoke of
above. In the more secret history there are said to have been
several who were called Father Liber and Hercules. This
Hercules, whose great deeds are reckoned as twelve (not including
the slaughter of Antæus the African, because that
affair pertains to another Hercules), is declared in their books
to have burned himself on Mount &#338;ta, because he was not
able, by that strength with which he had subdued monsters,
to endure the disease under which he languished. At that
time the king, or rather tyrant Busiris, who is alleged to have
been the son of Neptune by Libya the daughter of Epaphus,
is said to have offered up his guests in sacrifice to the gods.
Now it must not be believed that Neptune committed this
adultery, lest the gods should be criminated; yet such things
must be ascribed to them by the poets and in the theatres,
that they may be pleased with them. Vulcan and Minerva
are said to have been the parents of Ericthonius king of
Athens, in whose last years Joshua the son of Nun is found
to have died. But since they will have it that Minerva is
a virgin, they say that Vulcan, being disturbed in the struggle
between them, poured out his seed into the earth, and on that
account the man born of it received that name; for in the
Greek language &#7956;&#961;&#953;&#962; is "strife," and &#967;&#952;&#8060;&#957; "earth," of which two
words Ericthonius is a compound. Yet it must be admitted
that the more learned disprove and disown such things concerning
their gods, and declare that this fabulous belief originated
in the fact that in the temple at Athens, which Vulcan
and Minerva had in common, a boy who had been exposed
was found wrapped up in the coils of a dragon, which signified
that he would become great, and, as his parents were unknown,
he was called the son of Vulcan and Minerva, because
they had the temple in common. Yet that fable accounts for
the origin of his name better than this history. But what
does it matter to us? Let the one in books that speak the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
truth edify religious men, and the other in lying fables delight
impure demons. Yet these religious men worship them as
gods. Still, while they deny these things concerning them,
they cannot clear them of all crime, because at their demand
they exhibit plays in which the very things they wisely deny
are basely done, and the gods are appeased by these false and
base things. Now, even although the play celebrates an unreal
crime of the gods, yet to delight in the ascription of an unreal
crime is a real one.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>What fables were invented at the time when judges began to rule the
Hebrews.</i></p>

<p>After the death of Joshua the son of Nun, the people of
God had judges, in whose times they were alternately humbled
by afflictions on account of their sins, and consoled by prosperity
through the compassion of God. In those times were
invented the fables about Triptolemus, who, at the command
of Ceres, borne by winged snakes, bestowed corn on the needy
lands in flying over them; about that beast the Minotaur,
which was shut up in the Labyrinth, from which men who
entered its inextricable mazes could find no exit; about the
Centaurs, whose form was a compound of horse and man;
about Cerberus, the three-headed dog of hell; about Phryxus
and his sister Hellas, who fled, borne by a winged ram; about
the Gorgon, whose hair was composed of serpents, and who
turned those who looked on her into stone; about Bellerophon,
who was carried by a winged horse called Pegasus;
about Amphion, who charmed and attracted the stones by the
sweetness of his harp; about the artificer Dædalus and his
son Icarus, who flew on wings they had fitted on; about
&#338;dipus, who compelled a certain four-footed monster with a
human face, called a sphynx, to destroy herself by casting
herself headlong, having solved the riddle she was wont to
propose as insoluble; about Antæus, who was the son of the
earth, for which reason, on falling on the earth, he was wont
to rise up stronger, whom Hercules slew; and perhaps there
are others which I have forgotten. These fables, easily found
in histories containing a true account of events, bring us down
to the Trojan war, at which Marcus Varro has closed his
second book about the race of the Roman people; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
are so skilfully invented by men as to involve no scandal to
the gods. But whoever have pretended as to Jupiter's rape
of Ganymede, a very beautiful boy, that king Tantalus committed
the crime, and the fable ascribed it to Jupiter; or as
to his impregnating Danäe as a golden shower, that it means
that the woman's virtue was corrupted by gold: whether these
things were really done or only fabled in those days, or were
really done by others and falsely ascribed to Jupiter, it is
impossible to tell how much wickedness must have been taken
for granted in men's hearts that they should be thought able
to listen to such lies with patience. And yet they willingly
accepted them, when, indeed, the more devotedly they worshipped
Jupiter, they ought the more severely to have
punished those who durst say such things of him. But they
not only were not angry at those who invented these things,
but were afraid that the gods would be angry at them if they
did not act such fictions even in the theatres. In those times
Latona bore Apollo, not him of whose oracle we have spoken
above as so often consulted, but him who is said, along with
Hercules, to have fed the flocks of king Admetus; yet he was
so believed to be a god, that very many, indeed almost all, have
believed him to be the selfsame Apollo. Then also Father
Liber made war in India, and led in his army many women
called Bacchæ, who were notable not so much for valour as for
fury. Some, indeed, write that this Liber was both conquered
and bound; and some that he was slain in Persia, even telling
where he was buried; and yet in his name, as that of a god,
the unclean demons have instituted the sacred, or rather the
sacrilegious, Bacchanalia, of the outrageous vileness of which
the senate, after many years, became so much ashamed as to
prohibit them in the city of Rome. Men believed that in
those times Perseus and his wife Andromeda were raised into
heaven after their death, so that they were not ashamed or
afraid to mark out their images by constellations, and call
them by their names.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the theological poets.</i></p>

<p>During the same period of time arose the poets, who were
also called <i>theologues</i>, because they made hymns about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
gods; yet about such gods as, although great men, were yet
but men, or the elements of this world which the true God
made, or creatures who were ordained as principalities and
powers according to the will of the Creator and their own
merit. And if, among much that was vain and false, they
sang anything of the one true God, yet, by worshipping Him
along with others who are not gods, and showing them the
service that is due to Him alone, they did not serve Him at
all rightly; and even such poets as Orpheus, Musæus, and
Linus, were unable to abstain from dishonouring their gods by
fables. But yet these theologues worshipped the gods, and
were not worshipped as gods, although the city of the ungodly
is wont, I know not how, to set Orpheus over the sacred, or
rather sacrilegious, rites of hell. The wife of king Athamas,
who was called Ino, and her son Melicertes, perished by
throwing themselves into the sea, and were, according to popular
belief, reckoned among the gods, like other men of the same
times, [among whom were] Castor and Pollux. The Greeks,
indeed, called her who was the mother of Melicertes, Leucothea,
the Latins Matuta; but both thought her a goddess.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the fall of the kingdom of Argos, when Picus the son of Saturn first
received his father's kingdom of Laurentum.</i></p>

<p>During those times the kingdom of Argos came to an end,
being transferred to Mycene, from which Agamemnon came,
and the kingdom of Laurentum arose, of which Picus son of
Saturn was the first king, when the woman Deborah judged
the Hebrews; but it was the Spirit of God who used her as
His agent, for she was also a prophetess, although her prophecy
is so obscure that we could not demonstrate, without a
long discussion, that it was uttered concerning Christ. Now
the Laurentes already reigned in Italy, from whom the origin
of the Roman people is quite evidently derived after the
Greeks; yet the kingdom of Assyria still lasted, in which
Lampares was the twenty-third king when Picus first began
to reign at Laurentum. The worshippers of such gods may
see what they are to think of Saturn the father of Picus, who
deny that he was a man; of whom some also have written
that he himself reigned in Italy before Picus his son; and
Virgil in his well-known book says,&mdash;</p>

<p>But they regard these as poetic fancies, and assert that the
father of Picus was Sterces rather, and relate that, being a
most skilful husbandman, he discovered that the fields could
be fertilized by the dung of animals, which is called <i>stercus</i>
from his name. Some say he was called Stercutius. But
for whatever reason they chose to call him Saturn, it is
yet certain they made this Sterces or Stercutius a god for
his merit in agriculture; and they likewise received into the
number of these gods Picus his son, whom they affirm to
have been a famous augur and warrior. Picus begot Faunus,
the second king of Laurentum; and he too is, or was, a god
with them. These divine honours they gave to dead men
before the Trojan war.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>16. <i>Of Diomede, who after the destruction of Troy was placed among the gods,
while his companions are said to have been changed into birds.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Troy was overthrown, and its destruction was everywhere
sung and made well known even to boys; for it was signally
published and spread abroad, both by its own greatness and
by writers of excellent style. And this was done in the
reign of Latinus the son of Faunus, from whom the kingdom
began to be called Latium instead of Laurentum. The victorious
Greeks, on leaving Troy destroyed and returning to
their own countries, were torn and crushed by divers and
horrible calamities. Yet even from among them they increased
the number of their gods, for they made Diomede a
god. They allege that his return home was prevented by a
divinely imposed punishment, and they prove, not by fabulous
and poetic falsehood, but by historic attestation, that his companions
were turned into birds. Yet they think that, even
although he was made a god, he could neither restore them
to the human form by his own power, nor yet obtain it from
Jupiter his king, as a favour granted to a new inhabitant of
heaven. They also say that his temple is in the island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Diomedæa, not far from Mount Garganus in Apulia, and that
these birds fly round about this temple, and worship in it
with such wonderful obedience, that they fill their beaks with
water and sprinkle it; and if Greeks, or those born of the
Greek race, come there, they are not only still, but fly to meet
them; but if they are foreigners, they fly up at their heads,
and wound them with such severe strokes as even to kill
them. For they are said to be well enough armed for these
combats with their hard and large beaks.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>What Varro says of the incredible transformations of men.</i></p>

<p>In support of this story, Varro relates others no less incredible
about that most famous sorceress Circe, who changed
the companions of Ulysses into beasts, and about the Arcadians,
who, by lot, swam across a certain pool, and were turned into
wolves there, and lived in the deserts of that region with
wild beasts like themselves. But if they never fed on human
flesh for nine years, they were restored to the human form
on swimming back again through the same pool. Finally, he
expressly names one Demænetus, who, on tasting a boy offered
up in sacrifice by the Arcadians to their god Lycæus according
to their custom, was changed into a wolf, and, being restored
to his proper form in the tenth year, trained himself as a
pugilist, and was victorious at the Olympic games. And the
same historian thinks that the epithet Lycæus was applied
in Arcadia to Pan and Jupiter for no other reason than this
metamorphosis of men into wolves, because it was thought it
could not be wrought except by a divine power. For a wolf
is called in Greek &#955;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#962;, from which the name Lycæus appears
to be formed. He says also that the Roman Luperci
were as it were sprung of the seed of these mysteries.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>What we should believe concerning the transformations which seem to
happen to men through the art of demons.</i></p>

<p>Perhaps our readers expect us to say something about this
so great delusion wrought by the demons; and what shall we
say but that men must fly out of the midst of Babylon?<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> For
this prophetic precept is to be understood spiritually in this
sense, that by going forward in the living God, by the steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
faith, which worketh by love, we must flee out of the city of
this world, which is altogether a society of ungodly angels and
men. Yea, the greater we see the power of the demons to be
in these depths, so much the more tenaciously must we cleave
to the Mediator through whom we ascend from these lowest
to the highest places. For if we should say these things are
not to be credited, there are not wanting even now some
who would affirm that they had either heard on the best
authority, or even themselves experienced, something of that
kind. Indeed we ourselves, when in Italy, heard such things
about a certain region there, where landladies of inns, imbued
with these wicked arts, were said to be in the habit of giving
to such travellers as they chose, or could manage, something
in a piece of cheese by which they were changed on the spot
into beasts of burden, and carried whatever was necessary,
and were restored to their own form when the work was
done. Yet their mind did not become bestial, but remained
rational and human, just as Apuleius, in the books he wrote
with the title of <i>The Golden Ass</i>, has told, or feigned, that it
happened to his own self that, on taking poison, he became
an ass, while retaining his human mind.</p>

<p>These things are either false, or so extraordinary as to be
with good reason disbelieved. But it is to be most firmly
believed that Almighty God can do whatever He pleases,
whether in punishing or favouring, and that the demons can
accomplish nothing by their natural power (for their created
being is itself angelic, although made malign by their own
fault), except what He may permit, whose judgments are often
hidden, but never unrighteous. And indeed the demons, if
they really do such things as these on which this discussion
turns, do not create real substances, but only change the
appearance of things created by the true God so as to make
them seem to be what they are not. I cannot therefore
believe that even the body, much less the mind, can really be
changed into bestial forms and lineaments by any reason, art,
or power of the demons; but the phantasm of a man, which
even in thought or dreams goes through innumerable changes,
may, when the man's senses are laid asleep or overpowered,
be presented to the senses of others in a corporeal form, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
some indescribable way unknown to me, so that men's bodies
themselves may lie somewhere, alive, indeed, yet with their
senses locked up much more heavily and firmly than by
sleep, while that phantasm, as it were embodied in the shape
of some animal, may appear to the senses of others, and may
even seem to the man himself to be changed, just as he may
seem to himself in sleep to be so changed, and to bear burdens;
and these burdens, if they are real substances, are borne by
the demons, that men may be deceived by beholding at the
same time the real substance of the burdens and the simulated
bodies of the beasts of burden. For a certain man called
Præstantius used to tell that it had happened to his father in
his own house, that he took that poison in a piece of cheese,
and lay in his bed as if sleeping, yet could by no means be
aroused. But he said that after a few days he as it were
woke up and related the things he had suffered as if they
had been dreams, namely, that he had been made a sumpter
horse, and, along with other beasts of burden, had carried
provisions for the soldiers of what is called the Rh&#339;tian
Legion, because it was sent to Rh&#339;tia. And all this was
found to have taken place just as he told, yet it had seemed
to him to be his own dream. And another man declared
that in his own house at night, before he slept, he saw a
certain philosopher, whom he knew very well, come to him
and explain to him some things in the Platonic philosophy
which he had previously declined to explain when asked.
And when he had asked this philosopher why he did in his
house what he had refused to do at home, he said, "I did not
do it, but I dreamed I had done it." And thus what the
one saw when sleeping was shown to the other when awake
by a phantasmal image.</p>

<p>These things have not come to us from persons we might
deem unworthy of credit, but from informants we could not
suppose to be deceiving us. Therefore what men say and
have committed to writing about the Arcadians being often
changed into wolves by the Arcadian gods, or demons rather,
and what is told in song about Circe transforming the companions
of Ulysses,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> if they were really done, may, in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
opinion, have been done in the way I have said. As for
Diomede's birds, since their race is alleged to have been perpetuated
by constant propagation, I believe they were not
made through the metamorphosis of men, but were slyly
substituted for them on their removal, just as the hind was
for Iphigenia, the daughter of king Agamemnon. For juggleries
of this kind could not be difficult for the demons if
permitted by the judgment of God; and since that virgin
was afterward found alive, it is easy to see that a hind had
been slyly substituted for her. But because the companions
of Diomede were of a sudden nowhere to be seen, and afterward
could nowhere be found, being destroyed by bad avenging
angels, they were believed to have been changed into
those birds, which were secretly brought there from other
places where such birds were, and suddenly substituted for
them by fraud. But that they bring water in their beaks
and sprinkle it on the temple of Diomede, and that they
fawn on men of Greek race and persecute aliens, is no wonderful
thing to be done by the inward influence of the demons,
whose interest it is to persuade men that Diomede was made
a god, and thus to beguile them into worshipping many false
gods, to the great dishonour of the true God; and to serve
dead men, who even in their lifetime did not truly live,
with temples, altars, sacrifices, and priests, all which, when
of the right kind, are due only to the one living and true
God.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>That Æneas came into Italy when Abdon the judge ruled over the Hebrews.</i></p>

<p>After the capture and destruction of Troy, Æneas, with
twenty ships laden with the Trojan relics, came into Italy,
when Latinus reigned there, Menestheus in Athens, Polyphidos
in Sicyon, and Tautanos in Assyria, and Abdon was
judge of the Hebrews. On the death of Latinus, Æneas
reigned three years, the same kings continuing in the above-named
places, except that Pelasgus was now king in Sicyon,
and Sampson was judge of the Hebrews, who is thought to be
Hercules, because of his wonderful strength. Now the Latins
made Æneas one of their gods, because at his death he was
nowhere to be found. The Sabines also placed among the
gods their first king, Sancus, [Sangus], or Sanctus, as some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
call him. At that time Codrus king of Athens exposed
himself <i>incognito</i> to be slain by the Peloponnesian foes of
that city, and so was slain. In this way, they say, he delivered
his country. For the Peloponnesians had received a
response from the oracle, that they should overcome the
Athenians only on condition that they did not slay their
king. Therefore he deceived them by appearing in a poor
man's dress, and provoking them, by quarrelling, to murder
him. Whence Virgil says, "Or the quarrels of Codrus."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
And the Athenians worshipped this man as a god with
sacrificial honours. The fourth king of the Latins was
Silvius the son of Æneas, not by Creüsa, of whom Ascanius
the third king was born, but by Lavinia the daughter of
Latinus, and he is said to have been his posthumous child.
Oneus was the twenty-ninth king of Assyria, Melanthus the
sixteenth of the Athenians, and Eli the priest was judge of the
Hebrews; and the kingdom of Sicyon then came to an end,
after lasting, it is said, for nine hundred and fifty-nine years.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the succession of the line of kings among the Israelites after the times
of the judges.</i></p>

<p>While these kings reigned in the places mentioned, the
period of the judges being ended, the kingdom of Israel next
began with king Saul, when Samuel the prophet lived. At
that date those Latin kings began who were surnamed Silvii,
having that surname, in addition to their proper name, from
their predecessor, that son of Æneas who was called Silvius;
just as, long afterward, the successors of Cæsar Augustus
were surnamed Cæsars. Saul being rejected, so that none
of his issue should reign, on his death David succeeded him
in the kingdom, after he had reigned forty years. Then the
Athenians ceased to have kings after the death of Codrus,
and began to have a magistracy to rule the republic. After
David, who also reigned forty years, his son Solomon was
king of Israel, who built that most noble temple of God at
Jerusalem. In his time Alba was built among the Latins,
from which thereafter the kings began to be styled kings
not of the Latins, but of the Albans, although in the same
Latium. Solomon was succeeded by his son Rehoboam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
under whom that people was divided into two kingdoms, and
its separate parts began to have separate kings.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the kings of Latium, the first and twelfth of whom, Æneas and
Aventinus, were made gods.</i></p>

<p>After Æneas, whom they deified, Latium had eleven kings,
none of whom was deified. But Aventinus, who was the
twelfth after Æneas, having been laid low in war, and buried
in that hill still called by his name, was added to the number
of such gods as they made for themselves. Some, indeed,
were unwilling to write that he was slain in battle, but said
he was nowhere to be found, and that it was not from his
name, but from the alighting of birds, that hill was called
Aventinus.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> After this no god was made in Latium except
Romulus the founder of Rome. But two kings are found
between these two, the first of whom I shall describe in the
Virgilian verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Next came that Procas, glory of the Trojan race."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That greatest of all kingdoms, the Assyrian, had its long
duration brought to a close in his time, the time of Rome's
birth drawing nigh. For the Assyrian empire was transferred
to the Medes after nearly thirteen hundred and five
years, if we include the reign of Belus, who begot Ninus,
and, content with a small kingdom, was the first king there.
Now Procas reigned before Amulius. And Amulius had
made his brother Numitor's daughter, Rhea by name, who
was also called Ilia, a vestal virgin, who conceived twin
sons by Mars, as they will have it, in that way honouring
or excusing her adultery, adding as a proof that a she-wolf
nursed the infants when exposed. For they think this kind
of beast belongs to Mars, so that the she-wolf is believed to
have given her teats to the infants, because she knew they
were the sons of Mars her lord; although there are not wanting
persons who say that when the crying babes lay exposed,
they were first of all picked up by I know not what harlot,
and sucked her breasts first (now harlots were called <i>lupæ</i>, she-wolves,
from which their vile abodes are even yet called <i>lupanaria</i>),
and that afterwards they came into the hands of the
shepherd Faustulus, and were nursed by Acca his wife. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
what wonder is it, if, to rebuke the king who had cruelly
ordered them to be thrown into the water, God was pleased, after
divinely delivering them from the water, to succour, by means
of a wild beast giving milk, these infants by whom so great a
city was to be founded? Amulius was succeeded in the Latian
kingdom by his brother Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus;
and Rome was founded in the first year of this Numitor, who
from that time reigned along with his grandson Romulus.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>That Rome was founded when the Assyrian kingdom perished, at which
time Hezekiah reigned in Judah.</i></p>

<p>To be brief, the city of Rome was founded, like another
Babylon, and as it were the daughter of the former Babylon,
by which God was pleased to conquer the whole world, and
subdue it far and wide by bringing it into one fellowship of
government and laws. For there were already powerful and
brave peoples and nations trained to arms, who did not easily
yield, and whose subjugation necessarily involved great danger
and destruction as well as great and horrible labour. For
when the Assyrian kingdom subdued almost all Asia, although
this was done by fighting, yet the wars could not be very
fierce or difficult, because the nations were as yet untrained to
resist, and neither so many nor so great as afterward; forasmuch
as, after that greatest and indeed universal flood, when
only eight men escaped in Noah's ark, not much more than a
thousand years had passed when Ninus subdued all Asia with
the exception of India. But Rome did not with the same
quickness and facility wholly subdue all those nations of the
east and west which we see brought under the Roman empire,
because, in its gradual increase, in whatever direction it was extended,
it found them strong and warlike. At the time when
Rome was founded, then, the people of Israel had been in the
land of promise seven hundred and eighteen years. Of these
years twenty-seven belong to Joshua the son of Nun, and
after that three hundred and twenty-nine to the period of the
judges. But from the time when the kings began to reign
there, three hundred and sixty-two years had passed. And
at that time there was a king in Judah called Ahaz, or,
as others compute, Hezekiah his successor, the best and
most pious king, who it is admitted reigned in the times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Romulus. And in that part of the Hebrew nation called
Israel, Hoshea had begun to reign.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the Erythræan sibyl, who is known to have sung many things about
Christ more plainly than the other sibyls.</i></p>

<p>Some say the Erythræan sibyl prophesied at this time.
Now Varro declares there were many sibyls, and not merely
one. This sibyl of Erythræ certainly wrote some things
concerning Christ which are quite manifest, and we first read
them in the Latin tongue in verses of bad Latin, and unrhythmical,
through the unskilfulness, as we afterward learned, of
some interpreter unknown to me. For Flaccianus, a very
famous man, who was also a proconsul, a man of most ready
eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about
Christ, produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the
prophecies of the Erythræan sibyl, in which he pointed out a
certain passage which had the initial letters of the lines so
arranged that these words could be read in them: &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;
&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;, which mean, "Jesus Christ the Son
of God, the Saviour." And these verses, of which the initial
letters yield that meaning, contain what follows as translated
by some one into Latin in good rhythm:</p>

<p>In these Latin verses the meaning of the Greek is correctly
given, although not in the exact order of the lines as connected
with the initial letters; for in three of them, the fifth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter &#933; occurs,
Latin words could not be found beginning with the corresponding
letter, and yielding a suitable meaning. So that, if
we note down together the initial letters of all the lines in
our Latin translation except those three in which we retain
the letter &#933; in the proper place, they will express in five
Greek words this meaning, "Jesus Christ the Son of God, the
Saviour." And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube
of three. For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if
tripled, so as to rise from the superficial square to the cube,
comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial letters of
these five Greek words, &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;,
which mean, "Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour," they
will make the word &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#8058;&#962;, that is, "fish," in which word Christ
is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is,
to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the
depth of waters.</p>

<p>But this sibyl, whether she is the Erythræan, or, as some
rather believe, the Cumæan, in her whole poem, of which this
is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate
to the worship of the false or feigned gods, but rather speaks
against them and their worshippers in such a way that we
might even think she ought to be reckoned among those who
belong to the city of God. Lactantius also inserted in his
work the prophecies about Christ of a certain sibyl, he does
not say which. But I have thought fit to combine in a single
extract, which may seem long, what he has set down in many
short quotations. She says, "Afterward He shall come into
the injurious hands of the unbelieving, and they will give
God buffets with profane hands, and with impure mouth will
spit out envenomed spittle; but He will with simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace
when struck with the fist, that no one may find out what
word, or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He shall be
crowned with a crown of thorns. And they gave Him gall
for meat, and vinegar for His thirst: they will spread this
table of inhospitality. For thou thyself, being foolish, hast not
understood thy God, deluding the minds of mortals, but hast
both crowned Him with thorns and mingled for Him bitter
gall. But the veil of the temple shall be rent; and at midday
it shall be darker than night for three hours. And He shall
die the death, taking sleep for three days; and then returning
from hell, He first shall come to the light, the beginning of
the resurrection being shown to the recalled." Lactantius
made use of these sibylline testimonies, introducing them bit
by bit in the course of his discussion as the things he intended
to prove seemed to require, and we have set them down in one
connected series, uninterrupted by comment, only taking care
to mark them by capitals, if only the transcribers do not neglect
to preserve them hereafter. Some writers, indeed, say that the
Erythræan sibyl was not in the time of Romulus, but of the
Trojan war.</p>

<p>24. <i>That the seven sages flourished in the reign of Romulus, when the ten tribes
which were called Israel were led into captivity by the Chaldeans, and
Romulus, when dead, had divine honours conferred on him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>While Romulus reigned, Thales the Milesian is said to have
lived, being one of the seven sages, who succeeded the theological
poets, of whom Orpheus was the most renowned, and
were called &#931;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#8055;, that is, sages. During that time the ten
tribes, which on the division of the people were called Israel,
were conquered by the Chaldeans and led captive into their
lands, while the two tribes which were called Judah, and had
the seat of their kingdom in Jerusalem, remained in the land
of Judea. As Romulus, when dead, could nowhere be found,
the Romans, as is everywhere notorious, placed him among
the gods,&mdash;a thing which by that time had already ceased to
be done, and which was not done afterwards till the time of the
Cæsars, and then not through error, but in flattery; so that
Cicero ascribes great praises to Romulus, because he merited
such honours not in rude and unlearned times, when men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
were easily deceived, but in times already polished and learned,
although the subtle and acute loquacity of the philosophers
had not yet culminated. But although the later times did
not deify dead men, still they did not cease to hold and worship
as gods those deified of old; nay, by images, which the
ancients never had, they even increased the allurements of
vain and impious superstition, the unclean demons effecting
this in their heart, and also deceiving them by lying oracles,
so that even the fabulous crimes of the gods, which were not
once imagined by a more polite age, were yet basely acted in
the plays in honour of these same false deities. Numa reigned
after Romulus; and although he had thought that Rome would
be better defended the more gods there were, yet on his death
he himself was not counted worthy of a place among them, as
if it were supposed that he had so crowded heaven that a place
could not be found for him there. They report that the Samian
sibyl lived while he reigned at Rome, and when Manasseh
began to reign over the Hebrews,&mdash;an impious king, by whom
the prophet Isaiah is said to have been slain.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>What philosophers were famous when Tarquinius Priscus reigned over the
Romans, and Zedekiah over the Hebrews, when Jerusalem was taken and
the temple overthrown.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When Zedekiah reigned over the Hebrews, and Tarquinius
Priscus, the successor of Ancus Martius, over the Romans, the
Jewish people was led captive into Babylon, Jerusalem and
the temple built by Solomon being overthrown. For the prophets,
in chiding them for their iniquity and impiety, predicted
that these things should come to pass, especially Jeremiah,
who even stated the number of years. Pittacus of Mitylene,
another of the sages, is reported to have lived at that time.
And Eusebius writes that, while the people of God were held
captive in Babylon, the five other sages lived, who must be
added to Thales, whom we mentioned above, and Pittacus, in
order to make up the seven. These are Solon of Athens, Chilo
of Lacedæmon, Periander of Corinth, Cleobulus of Lindus, and
Bias of Priene. These flourished after the theological poets, and
were called sages, because they excelled other men in a certain
laudable line of life, and summed up some moral precepts
in epigrammatic sayings. But they left posterity no literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
monuments, except that Solon is alleged to have given certain
laws to the Athenians, and Thales was a natural philosopher,
and left books of his doctrine in short proverbs. In that time
of the Jewish captivity, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Xenophanes,
the natural philosophers, flourished. Pythagoras also
lived then, and at this time the name philosopher was first used.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>That at the time when the captivity of the Jews was brought to an end, on the
completion of seventy years, the Romans also were freed from kingly rule.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>At this time, Cyrus king of Persia, who also ruled the Chaldeans
and Assyrians, having somewhat relaxed the captivity
of the Jews, made fifty thousand of them return in order to
rebuild the temple. They only began the first foundations
and built the altar; but, owing to hostile invasions, they were
unable to go on, and the work was put off to the time of Darius.
During the same time also those things were done which are
written in the book of Judith, which, indeed, the Jews are
said not to have received into the canon of the Scriptures.
Under Darius king of Persia, then, on the completion of the
seventy years predicted by Jeremiah the prophet, the captivity
of the Jews was brought to an end, and they were restored
to liberty. Tarquin then reigned as the seventh king of the
Romans. On his expulsion, they also began to be free from
the rule of their kings. Down to this time the people of
Israel had prophets; but, although they were numerous, the
canonical writings of only a few of them have been preserved
among the Jews and among us. In closing the previous book,
I promised to set down something in this one about them, and
I shall now do so.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>Of the times of the prophets whose oracles are contained in books, and who
sang many things about the call of the Gentiles at the time when the Roman
kingdom began and the Assyrian came to an end.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In order that we may be able to consider these times, let us
go back a little to earlier times. At the beginning of the book
of the prophet Hosea, who is placed first of twelve, it is written,
"The word of the Lord which came to Hosea in the days of
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Amos
also writes that he prophesied in the days of Uzziah, and adds
the name of Jeroboam king of Israel, who lived at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
time.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Isaiah the son of Amos&mdash;either the above-named prophet,
or, as is rather affirmed, another who was not a prophet, but
was called by the same name&mdash;also puts at the head of his book
these four kings named by Hosea, saying by way of preface
that he prophesied in their days.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Micah also names the same
times as those of his prophecy, after the days of Uzziah;<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> for
he names the same three kings as Hosea named,&mdash;Jotham,
Ahaz, and Hezekiah. We find from their own writings that
these men prophesied contemporaneously. To these are added
Jonah in the reign of Uzziah, and Joel in that of Jotham, who
succeeded Uzziah. But we can find the date of these two
prophets in the chronicles,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> not in their own writings, for they
say nothing about it themselves. Now these days extend from
Procas king of the Latins, or his predecessor Aventinus, down
to Romulus king of the Romans, or even to the beginning of
the reign of his successor, Numa Pompilius. Hezekiah king
of Judah certainly reigned till then. So that thus these fountains
of prophecy, as I may call them, burst forth at once during
those times when the Assyrian kingdom failed and the Roman
began; so that, just as in the first period of the Assyrian kingdom
Abraham arose, to whom the most distinct promises were
made that all nations should be blessed in his seed, so at the
beginning of the western Babylon, in the time of whose government
Christ was to come in whom these promises were to be
fulfilled, the oracles of the prophets were given not only in
spoken but in written words, for a testimony that so great a
thing should come to pass. For although the people of Israel
hardly ever lacked prophets from the time when they began to
have kings, these were only for their own use, not for that of
the nations. But when the more manifestly prophetic Scripture
began to be formed, which was to benefit the nations
too, it was fitting that it should begin when this city was
founded which was to rule the nations.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>Of the things pertaining to the gospel of Christ which Hosea and Amos
prophesied.</i></p>

<p>The prophet Hosea speaks so very profoundly that it is
laborious work to penetrate his meaning. But, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
promise, we must insert something from his book. He says,
"And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was
said unto them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be
called the sons of the living God."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Even the apostles understood
this as a prophetic testimony of the calling of the nations
who did not formerly belong to God; and because this same
people of the Gentiles is itself spiritually among the children
of Abraham, and for that reason is rightly called Israel, therefore
he goes on to say, "And the children of Judah and the
children of Israel shall be gathered together in one, and shall
appoint themselves one headship, and shall ascend from the
earth."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> We should but weaken the savour of this prophetic
oracle if we set ourselves to expound it. Let the reader but
call to mind that corner-stone and those two walls of partition,
the one of the Jews, the other of the Gentiles,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> and he will recognise
them, the one under the term sons of Judah, the other
as sons of Israel, supporting themselves by one and the same
headship, and ascending from the earth. But that those carnal
Israelites who are now unwilling to believe in Christ shall
afterward believe, that is, their children shall (for they themselves,
of course, shall go to their own place by dying), this
same prophet testifies, saying, "For the children of Israel shall
abide many days without a king, without a prince, without a
sacrifice, without an altar, without a priesthood, without manifestations."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
Who does not see that the Jews are now thus?
But let us hear what he adds: "And afterward shall the children
of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David
their king, and shall be amazed at the Lord and at His goodness
in the latter days."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Nothing is clearer than this prophecy,
in which by David, as distinguished by the title of king,
Christ is to be understood, "who is made," as the apostle says,
"of the seed of David according to the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> This prophet
has also foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third day,
as it behoved to be foretold, with prophetic loftiness, when he
says, "He will heal us after two days, and in the third day we
shall rise again."<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> In agreement with this the apostle says
to us, "If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
above."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Amos also prophesies thus concerning such things:
"Prepare thee, that thou mayst invoke thy God, O Israel; for
lo, I am binding the thunder, and creating the spirit, and announcing
to men their Christ."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> And in another place he
says, "In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that
is fallen, and build up the breaches thereof; and I will raise
up his ruins, and will build them up again as in the days of
old: that the residue of men may inquire for me, and all the
nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord that
doeth this."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>


<p class="center">29. <i>What things are predicted by Isaiah concerning Christ and the Church.</i></p>

<p>The prophecy of Isaiah is not in the book of the twelve
prophets, who are called the minor from the brevity of their
writings, as compared with those who are called the greater
prophets because they published larger volumes. Isaiah belongs
to the latter, yet I connect him with the two above
named, because he prophesied at the same time. Isaiah, then,
together with his rebukes of wickedness, precepts of righteousness,
and predictions of evil, also prophesied much more than
the rest about Christ and the Church, that is, about the King
and that city which he founded; so that some say he should
be called an evangelist rather than a prophet. But, in order
to finish this work, I quote only one out of many in this
place. Speaking in the person of the Father, he says, "Behold,
my servant shall understand, and shall be exalted and glorified
very much. As many shall be astonished at Thee."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> This is
about Christ.</p>

<p>But let us now hear what follows about the Church. He
says, "Rejoice, O barren, thou that barest not; break forth
and cry, thou that didst not travail with child: for many more
are the children of the desolate than of her that has an husband."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
But these must suffice; and some things in them
ought to be expounded; yet I think those parts sufficient which
are so plain that even enemies must be compelled against their
will to understand them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">30. <i>What Micah, Jonah, and Joel prophesied in accordance with the New
Testament.</i></p>

<p>The prophet Micah, representing Christ under the figure of
a great mountain, speaks thus: "It shall come to pass in the
last days, that the manifested mountain of the Lord shall be
prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted
above the hills; and people shall hasten unto it. Many nations
shall go, and shall say, Come, let us go up into the mountain of
the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob; and He
will show us His way, and we will go in His paths: for out
of Zion shall proceed the law, and the word of the Lord out
of Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many people, and
rebuke strong nations afar off."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> This prophet predicts the
very place in which Christ was born, saying, "And thou,
Bethlehem, of the house of Ephratah, art the least that can
be reckoned among the thousands of Judah; out of thee shall
come forth unto me a leader, to be the prince in Israel; and His
going forth is from the beginning, even from the days of eternity.
Therefore will He give them [up] even until the time
when she that travaileth shall bring forth; and the remnant
of His brethren shall be converted to the sons of Israel. And
He shall stand, and see, and feed His flock in the strength of
the Lord, and in the dignity of the name of the Lord His
God: for now shall He be magnified even to the utmost of
the earth."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The prophet Jonah, not so much by speech as by his own
painful experience, prophesied Christ's death and resurrection
much more clearly than if he had proclaimed them with his
voice. For why was he taken into the whale's belly and restored
on the third day, but that he might be a sign that
Christ should return from the depths of hell on the third
day?</p>

<p>I should be obliged to use many words in explaining all
that Joel prophesies in order to make clear those that pertain
to Christ and the Church. But there is one passage I must
not pass by, which the apostles also quoted when the Holy
Spirit came down from above on the assembled believers according
to Christ's promise. He says, "And it shall come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
pass after these things, that I will pour out my Spirit upon
all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
and your old men shall dream, and your young men shall see
visions: and even on my servants and mine handmaids in
those days will I pour out my Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>


<p class="center">31. <i>Of the predictions concerning the salvation of the world in Christ, in
Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk.</i></p>

<p>The date of three of the minor prophets, Obadiah, Nahum,
and Habakkuk, is neither mentioned by themselves nor given
in the chronicles of Eusebius and Jerome. For although
they put Obadiah with Micah, yet when Micah prophesied
does not appear from that part of their writings in which the
dates are noted. And this, I think, has happened through
their error in negligently copying the works of others. But we
could not find the two others now mentioned in the copies of
the chronicles which we have; yet because they are contained
in the canon, we ought not to pass them by.</p>

<p>Obadiah, so far as his writings are concerned, the briefest
of all the prophets, speaks against Idumea, that is, the nation
of Esau, that reprobate elder of the twin sons of Isaac and
grandsons of Abraham. Now if, by that form of speech in
which a part is put for the whole, we take Idumea as put
for the nations, we may understand of Christ what he says
among other things, "But upon Mount Sion shall be safety,
and there shall be a Holy One."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> And a little after, at the
end of the same prophecy, he says, "And those who are saved
again shall come up out of Mount Sion, that they may defend
Mount Esau, and it shall be a kingdom to the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It is
quite evident this was fulfilled when those saved again out of
Mount Sion&mdash;that is, the believers in Christ from Judea, of
whom the apostles are chiefly to be acknowledged&mdash;went up
to defend Mount Esau. How could they defend it except by
making safe, through the preaching of the gospel, those who
believed that they might be "delivered from the power of
darkness and translated into the kingdom of God?"<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> This
he expressed as an inference, adding, "And it shall be to the
Lord a kingdom." For Mount Sion signifies Judea, where
it is predicted there shall be safety, and a Holy One, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Christ Jesus. But Mount Esau is Idumea, which signifies
the Church of the Gentiles, which, as I have expounded, those
saved again out of Sion have defended that it should be a
kingdom to the Lord. This was obscure before it took place;
but what believer does not find it out now that it is done?</p>

<p>As for the prophet Nahum, through him God says, "I will
exterminate the graven and the molten things: I will make
thy burial. For lo, the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings
and announceth peace are swift upon the mountains! O
Judah, celebrate thy festival days, and perform thy vows; for
now they shall not go on any more so as to become antiquated.
It is completed, it is consumed, it is taken away.
He ascendeth who breathes in thy face, delivering thee out of
tribulation."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Let him that remembers the gospel call to
mind who hath ascended from hell and breathed the Holy
Spirit in the face of Judah, that is, of the Jewish disciples;
for they belong to the New Testament, whose festival days are
so spiritually renewed that they cannot become antiquated.
Moreover, we already see the graven and molten things, that
is, the idols of the false gods, exterminated through the
gospel, and given up to oblivion as of the grave, and we
know that this prophecy is fulfilled in this very thing.</p>

<p>Of what else than the advent of Christ, who was to come,
is Habakkuk understood to say, "And the Lord answered me,
and said, Write the vision openly on a tablet of boxwood, that
he that readeth these things may understand. For the vision
is yet for a time appointed, and it will arise in the end, and
will not become void: if it tarry, wait for it; because it will
surely come, and will not be delayed?"<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>


<p class="center">32. <i>Of the prophecy that is contained in the prayer and song of Habakkuk.</i></p>

<p>In his prayer, with a song, to whom but the Lord Christ
does he say, "O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing, and was
afraid: O Lord, I have considered Thy works, and was greatly
afraid?"<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> What is this but the inexpressible admiration of
the foreknown, new, and sudden salvation of men? "In the

is this but either between the two testaments, or between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
two thieves, or between Moses and Elias talking with Him on
the mount? "While the years draw nigh, Thou wilt be recognised;
at the coming of the time Thou wilt be shown,"
does not even need exposition. "While my soul shall be
troubled at Him, in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy."
What is this but that He puts Himself for the Jews, of whose
nation He was, who were troubled with great anger and crucified
Christ, when He, mindful of mercy, said, "Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do?"<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> "God shall come
from Teman, and the Holy One from the shady and close mountain."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
What is said here, "He shall come from Teman," some
interpret "from the south," or "from the south-west," by which
is signified the noonday, that is, the fervour of charity and the
splendour of truth. "The shady and close mountain" might be
understood in many ways, yet I prefer to take it as meaning
the depth of the divine Scriptures, in which Christ is prophesied:
for in the Scriptures there are many things shady and close
which exercise the mind of the reader; and Christ comes
thence when he who has understanding finds Him there.
"His power covereth up the heavens, and the earth is full of
His praise." What is this but what is also said in the psalm,
"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory
above all the earth?"<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> "His splendour shall be as the light."
What is it but that the fame of Him shall illuminate believers?
"Horns are in His hands." What is this but the
trophy of the cross? "And He hath placed the firm charity
of His strength"<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> needs no exposition. "Before His face
shall go the word, and it shall go forth into the field after
His feet." What is this but that He should both be announced
before His coming hither and after His return
hence? "He stood, and the earth was moved." What is
this but that "He stood" for succour, "and the earth was
moved" to believe? "He regarded, and the nations melted;"
that is, He had compassion, and made the people penitent.
"The mountains are broken with violence;" that is, through
the power of those who work miracles the pride of the
haughty is broken. "The everlasting hills flowed down;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
that is, they are humbled in time that they may be lifted
up for eternity. "I saw His goings [made] eternal for His
labours;" that is, I beheld His labour of love not left without
the reward of eternity. "The tents of Ethiopia shall be greatly
afraid, and the tents of the land of Midian;" that is, even
those nations which are not under the Roman authority, being
suddenly terrified by the news of Thy wonderful works, shall
become a Christian people. "Wert Thou angry at the rivers,
O Lord? or was Thy fury against the rivers? or was Thy rage
against the sea?" This is said because He does not now
come to condemn the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> "For Thou shalt mount upon Thy horses,
and Thy riding shall be salvation;" that is, Thine evangelists
shall carry Thee, for they are guided by Thee, and Thy
gospel is salvation to them that believe in Thee. "Bending,
Thou wilt bend Thy bow against the sceptres, saith the Lord;"
that is, Thou wilt threaten even the kings of the earth with
Thy judgment. "The earth shall be cleft with rivers;" that
is, by the sermons of those who preach Thee flowing in upon
them, men's hearts shall be opened to make confession, to
whom it is said, "Rend your hearts and not your garments."<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
What does "The people shall see Thee and grieve"
mean, but that in mourning they shall be blessed?<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> What
is "Scattering the waters in marching," but that by walking in
those who everywhere proclaim Thee, Thou wilt scatter hither
and thither the streams of Thy doctrine? What is "The
abyss uttered its voice?" Is it not that the depth of the
human heart expressed what it perceived? The words, "The
depth of its phantasy," are an explanation of the previous verse,
for the depth is the abyss; and "Uttered its voice" is to be
understood before them, that is, as we have said, it expressed
what it perceived. Now the phantasy is the vision, which it
did not hold or conceal, but poured forth in confession. "The
sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her course;"
that is, Christ ascended into heaven, and the Church was
established under her King. "Thy darts shall go in the
light;" that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but
openly. For He had said to His own disciples, "What I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
you in darkness, that speak ye in the light."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> "By threatening
thou shalt diminish the earth;" that is, by that threatening
Thou shalt humble men. "And in fury Thou shalt cast down
the nations;" for in punishing those who exalt themselves Thou
dashest them one against another. "Thou wentest forth for
the salvation of Thy people, that Thou mightest save Thy
Christ; Thou hast sent death on the heads of the wicked."
None of these words require exposition. "Thou hast lifted
up the bonds, even to the neck." This may be understood
even of the good bonds of wisdom, that the feet may be put
into its fetters, and the neck into its collar. "Thou hast
struck off in amazement of mind the bonds" must be understood
for, He lifts up the good and strikes off the bad, about
which it is said to Him, "Thou hast broken asunder my
bonds,"<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> and that "in amazement of mind," that is, wonderfully.
"The heads of the mighty shall be moved in it;" to
wit, in that wonder. "They shall open their teeth like a poor
man eating secretly." For some of the mighty among the
Jews shall come to the Lord, admiring His works and words,
and shall greedily eat the bread of His doctrine in secret for
fear of the Jews, just as the Gospel has shown they did.
"And Thou hast sent into the sea Thy horses, troubling many
waters," which are nothing else than many people; for unless
all were troubled, some would not be converted with fear,
others pursued with fury. "I gave heed, and my belly
trembled at the voice of the prayer of my lips; and trembling
entered into my bones, and my habit of body was
troubled under me." He gave heed to those things which he
said, and was himself terrified at his own prayer, which he
had poured forth prophetically, and in which he discerned
things to come. For when many people are troubled, he saw
the threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged
himself a member of it, and said, "I shall rest in the
day of tribulation," as being one of those who are rejoicing in
hope, patient in tribulation.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> "That I may ascend," he says,
"among the people of my pilgrimage," departing quite from the
wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims in
this earth, and do not seek the country above.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> "Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the fig-tree," he says, "shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall lie, and the fields
shall yield no meat; the sheep shall be cut off from the
meat, and there shall be no oxen in the stalls." He sees that
nation which was to slay Christ about to lose the abundance
of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set
forth by the figure of earthly plenty. And because that
nation was to suffer such wrath of God, because, being ignorant
of the righteousness of God, it wished to establish its
own,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> he immediately says, "Yet will I rejoice in the Lord; I
will joy in God my salvation. The Lord God is my strength,
and He will set my feet in completion; He will place me
above the heights, that I may conquer in His song," to wit,
in that song of which something similar is said in the psalm,
"He set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings, and put
in my mouth a new song, a hymn to our God."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> He therefore
conquers in the song of the Lord, who takes pleasure in
His praise, not in his own; that "He that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> But some copies have, "I will joy in God
my Jesus," which seems to me better than the version of those
who, wishing to put it in Latin, have not set down that very
name which for us it is dearer and sweeter to name.</p>


<p class="center">33. <i>What Jeremiah and Zephaniah have, by the prophetic Spirit, spoken before
concerning Christ and the calling of the nations.</i></p>

<p>Jeremiah, like Isaiah, is one of the greater prophets, not of
the minor, like the others from whose writings I have just
given extracts. He prophesied when Josiah reigned in Jerusalem,
and Ancus Martius at Rome, when the captivity of the
Jews was already at hand; and he continued to prophesy
down to the fifth month of the captivity, as we find from his
writings. Zephaniah, one of the minor prophets, is put along
with him, because he himself says that he prophesied in the
days of Josiah; but he does not say till when. Jeremiah thus
prophesied not only in the times of Ancus Martius, but also
in those of Tarquinius Priscus, whom the Romans had for
their fifth king. For he had already begun to reign when
that captivity took place. Jeremiah, in prophesying of Christ,
says, "The breath of our mouth, the Lord Christ, was taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
our sins,"<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> thus briefly showing both that Christ is our Lord
and that He suffered for us. Also in another place he says,
"This is my God, and there shall none other be accounted of
in comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of
prudence, and hath given it to Jacob His servant, and to
Israel His beloved: afterward He was seen on the earth, and
conversed with men."<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Some attribute this testimony not to
Jeremiah, but to his secretary, who was called Baruch; but it
is more commonly ascribed to Jeremiah. Again the same
prophet says concerning Him, "Behold the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous shoot,
and a King shall reign and shall be wise, and shall do judgment
and justice in the earth. In those days Judah shall be
saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently: and this is the
name which they shall call Him, Our righteous Lord."<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> And
of the calling of the nations which was to come to pass, and
which we now see fulfilled, he thus spoke: "O Lord my God,
and my refuge in the day of evils, to Thee shall the nations
come from the utmost end of the earth, saying, Truly our
fathers have worshipped lying images, wherein there is no
profit."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> But that the Jews, by whom He behoved even to be
slain, were not going to acknowledge Him, this prophet thus
intimates: "Heavy is the heart through all; and He is a man,
and who shall know Him?"<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> That passage also is his which
I have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new
testament, of which Christ is the Mediator. For Jeremiah
himself says, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will complete over the house of Jacob a new testament," and
the rest, which may be read there.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>For the present I shall put down those predictions about
Christ by the prophet Zephaniah, who prophesied with Jeremiah.
"Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my
resurrection, in the future; because it is my determination to
assemble the nations, and gather together the kingdoms."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
And again he says, "The Lord will be terrible upon them,
and will exterminate all the gods of the earth; and they shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
worship Him every man from his place, even all the isles of
the nations."<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> And a little after he says, "Then will I turn
to the people a tongue, and to His offspring, that they may
call upon the name of the Lord, and serve Him under one
yoke. From the borders of the rivers of Ethiopia shall they
bring sacrifices unto me. In that day thou shalt not be confounded
for all thy curious inventions, which thou hast done
impiously against me: for then I will take away from thee
the naughtiness of thy trespass; and thou shalt no more
magnify thyself above thy holy mountain. And I will leave
in thee a meek and humble people, and they who shall be left
of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> These are the
remnant of whom the apostle quotes that which is elsewhere
prophesied: "Though the number of the children of Israel be
as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> These
are the remnant of that nation who have believed in Christ.</p>


<p class="center">34. <i>Of the prophecy of Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets.</i></p>

<p>Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets, also
first prophesied in the very captivity of Babylon. Daniel even
defined the time when Christ was to come and suffer by the
exact date. It would take too long to show this by computation,
and it has been done often by others before us. But of
His power and glory he has thus spoken: "I saw in a night
vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man was coming with
the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of
days, and He was brought into His presence. And to Him
there was given dominion, and honour, and a kingdom: and
all people, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him. His power is
an everlasting power, which shall not pass away, and His
kingdom shall not be destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>Ezekiel also, speaking prophetically in the person of God
the Father, thus foretells Christ, speaking of Him in the prophetic
manner as David because He assumed flesh of the
seed of David, and on account of that form of a servant in
which He was made man, He who is the Son of God is also
called the servant of God. He says, "And I will set up over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
my sheep one Shepherd, who will feed them, even my servant
David; and He shall feed them, and He shall be their shepherd.
And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant
David a prince in the midst of them. I the Lord have
spoken."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> And in another place he says, "And one King
shall be over them all: and they shall no more be two
nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two
kingdoms: neither shall they defile themselves any more with
their idols, and their abominations, and all their iniquities.
And I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein
they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be
my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David
shall be king over them, and there shall be one Shepherd for
them all."<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>


<p class="center">35. <i>Of the prophecy of the three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</i></p>

<p>There remain three minor prophets, Haggai, Zechariah,
and Malachi, who prophesied at the close of the captivity.
Of these Haggai more openly prophesies of Christ and the
Church thus briefly: "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet one
little while, and I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and
the sea, and the dry land; and I will move all nations, and
the desired of all nations shall come."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The fulfilment of
this prophecy is in part already seen, and in part hoped for
in the end. For He moved the heaven by the testimony of
the angels and the stars, when Christ became incarnate. He
moved the earth by the great miracle of His birth of the
virgin. He moved the sea and the dry land, when Christ
was proclaimed both in the isles and in the whole world. So
we see all nations moved to the faith; and the fulfilment of
what follows, "And the desired of all nations shall come," is
looked for at His last coming. For ere men can desire and
wait for Him, they must believe and love Him.</p>

<p>Zechariah says of Christ and the Church, "Rejoice greatly,
O daughter of Sion; shout joyfully, O daughter of Jerusalem:
behold, thy King shall come unto thee, just and the Saviour;
Himself poor, and mounting an ass, and a colt the foal of an
ass: and His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the
river even to the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> How this was done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
when the Lord Christ on His journey used a beast of burden
of this kind, we read in the Gospel, where, also, as much of
this prophecy is quoted as appears sufficient for the context.
In another place, speaking in the Spirit of prophecy to Christ
Himself of the remission of sins through His blood, he says,
"Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament, hast sent forth
Thy prisoners from the lake wherein is no water."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Different
opinions may be held, consistently with right belief, as
to what he meant by this lake. Yet it seems to me that no
meaning suits better than that of the depth of human misery,
which is, as it were, dry and barren, where there are no
streams of righteousness, but only the mire of iniquity. For
it is said of it in the Psalms, "And He led me forth out of
the lake of misery, and from the miry clay."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>Malachi, foretelling the Church which we now behold propagated
through Christ, says most openly to the Jews, in the
person of God, "I have no pleasure in you, and I will not
accept a gift at your hand. For from the rising even to the
going down of the sun, my name is great among the nations;
and in every place sacrifice shall be made, and a pure oblation
shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great
among the nations, saith the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Since we can already
see this sacrifice offered to God in every place, from the rising
of the sun to his going down, through Christ's priesthood after
the order of Melchisedec, while the Jews, to whom it was
said, "I have no pleasure in you, neither will I accept a gift
at your hand," cannot deny that their sacrifice has ceased, why
do they still look for another Christ, when they read this in
the prophecy, and see it fulfilled, which could not be fulfilled
except through Him? And a little after he says of Him, in
the person of God, "My covenant was with Him of life and
peace; and I gave to Him that He might fear me with fear,
and be afraid before my name. The law of truth was in His
mouth: directing in peace He hath walked with me, and hath
turned many away from iniquity. For the Priest's lips shall
keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth:
for He is the Angel of the Lord Almighty."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Nor is it to be
wondered at that Christ Jesus is called the Angel of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Almighty God. For just as He is called a servant on account
of the form of a servant in which He came to men, so He is
called an angel on account of the <i>evangel</i> which He proclaimed
to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, <i>evangel</i> is
"good news," and <i>angel</i> is "messenger." Again he says of Him,
"Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out the
way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly
come into His temple, even the Angel of the testament,
whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty,
and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand
at His appearing?"<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> In this place he has foretold both the
first and second advent of Christ: the first, to wit, of which he
says, "And He shall come suddenly into His temple;" that
is, into His flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, "Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> And
of the second advent he says, "Behold, He cometh, saith the
Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or
who shall stand at His appearing?" But what he says, "The
Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye
desire," just means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures
which they read, shall seek and desire Christ. But
many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they
sought and desired had come, being blinded in their hearts,
which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now what
he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, "My
testament had been with Him," or here, where he has called
Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to
take to be the new testament, in which the things promised
are eternal, and not the old, in which they are only temporal.
Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the
wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value
them greatly, and serve the true God to be rewarded with
them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal blessedness
of the new testament, which shall be given only to the
good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for the
most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says,
"Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have
said, In what have we spoken ill of Thee? Ye have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it
that we have kept His observances, and that we have walked
as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? And
now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things
are built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are
saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these reproaches
every one to his neighbour: and the Lord hearkened and
heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before Him, for
them that fear the Lord and that revere His name."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> By that
book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what
follows: "And they shall be an acquisition for me, saith the
Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will choose
them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye
shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust,
and between him that serveth God and him that serveth
Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven,
and it shall burn them up; and all the aliens and all that do
wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come will
set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave
neither root nor branch. And unto you that fear my name
shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in
His wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose

<p class="center">36. <i>About Esdras and the books of the Maccabees.</i></p>

<p>After these three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,
during the same period of the liberation of the people from
the Babylonian servitude Esdras also wrote, who is historical
rather than prophetical, as is also the book called Esther, which
is found to relate, for the praise of God, events not far from
those times; unless, perhaps, Esdras is to be understood as
prophesying of Christ in that passage where, on a question
having arisen among certain young men as to what is the
strongest thing, when one had said kings, another wine, the
third women, who for the most part rule kings, yet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
same third youth demonstrated that the truth is victorious
over all.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> For by consulting the Gospel we learn that Christ
is the Truth. From this time, when the temple was rebuilt,
down to the time of Aristobulus, the Jews had not kings but
princes; and the reckoning of their dates is found, not in the
Holy Scriptures which are called canonical, but in others,
among which are also the books of the Maccabees. These
are held as canonical, not by the Jews, but by the Church, on
account of the extreme and wonderful sufferings of certain
martyrs, who, before Christ had come in the flesh, contended
for the law of God even unto death, and endured most grievous
and horrible evils.</p>


<p class="center">37. <i>That prophetic records are found which are more ancient than any fountain
of the Gentile philosophy.</i></p>

<p>In the time of our prophets, then, whose writings had
already come to the knowledge of almost all nations, the
philosophers of the nations had not yet arisen,&mdash;at least, not
those who were called by that name, which originated with
Pythagoras the Samian, who was becoming famous at the
time when the Jewish captivity ended. Much more, then,
are the other philosophers found to be later than the prophets.
For even Socrates the Athenian, the master of all who were
then most famous, holding the pre-eminence in that department
that is called the moral or active, is found after Esdras
in the chronicles. Plato also was born not much later, who
far outwent the other disciples of Socrates. If, besides these,
we take their predecessors, who had not yet been styled
philosophers, to wit, the seven sages, and then the physicists,
who succeeded Thales, and imitated his studious search into
the nature of things, namely, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and
Anaxagoras, and some others, before Pythagoras first professed
himself a philosopher, even these did not precede the
whole of our prophets in antiquity of time, since Thales,
whom the others succeeded, is said to have flourished in the
reign of Romulus, when the stream of prophecy burst forth
from the fountains of Israel in those writings which spread
over the whole world. So that only those theological poets,
Orpheus, Linus, and Musæus, and, it may be, some others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
among the Greeks, are found earlier in date than the Hebrew
prophets whose writings we hold as authoritative. But not
even these preceded in time our true divine, Moses, who
authentically preached the one true God, and whose writings
are first in the authoritative canon; and therefore the Greeks,
in whose tongue the literature of this age chiefly appears, have
no ground for boasting of their wisdom, in which our religion,
wherein is true wisdom, is not evidently more ancient at
least, if not superior. Yet it must be confessed that before
Moses there had already been, not indeed among the Greeks,
but among barbarous nations, as in Egypt, some doctrine
which might be called their wisdom, else it would not have
been written in the holy books that Moses was learned in all
the wisdom of the Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> as he was, when, being born
there, and adopted and nursed by Pharaoh's daughter, he was
also liberally educated. Yet not even the wisdom of the
Egyptians could be antecedent in time to the wisdom of our
prophets, because even Abraham was a prophet. And what
wisdom could there be in Egypt before Isis had given them
letters, whom they thought fit to worship as a goddess after
her death? Now Isis is declared to have been the daughter
of Inachus, who first began to reign in Argos when the grandsons
of Abraham are known to have been already born.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>38. <i>That the ecclesiastical canon has not admitted certain writings on account
of their too great antiquity, lest through them false things should be inserted
instead of true.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If I may recall far more ancient times, our patriarch Noah
was certainly even before that great deluge, and I might not
undeservedly call him a prophet, forasmuch as the ark he made,
in which he escaped with his family, was itself a prophecy of
our times.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> What of Enoch, the seventh from Adam? Does
not the canonical epistle of the Apostle Jude declare that he
prophesied?<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> But the writings of these men could not be
held as authoritative either among the Jews or us, on account
of their too great antiquity, which made it seem needful to
regard them with suspicion, lest false things should be set
forth instead of true. For some writings which are said to
be theirs are quoted by those who, according to their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
humour, loosely believe what they please. But the purity of
the canon has not admitted these writings, not because the
authority of these men who pleased God is rejected, but because
they are not believed to be theirs. Nor ought it to
appear strange if writings for which so great antiquity is
claimed are held in suspicion, seeing that in the very history
of the kings of Judah and Israel containing their acts, which
we believe to belong to the canonical Scripture, very many
things are mentioned which are not explained there, but are
said to be found in other books which the prophets wrote, the
very names of these prophets being sometimes given, and yet
they are not found in the canon which the people of God received.
Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me;
only I think that even those men, to whom certainly the Holy
Spirit revealed those things which ought to be held as of religious
authority, might write some things as men by historical
diligence, and others as prophets by divine inspiration; and
these things were so distinct, that it was judged that the
former should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter to
God speaking through them: and so the one pertained to the
abundance of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion.
In that authority the canon is guarded. So that, if any writings
outside of it are now brought forward under the name of
the ancient prophets, they cannot serve even as an aid to
knowledge, because it is uncertain whether they are genuine;
and on this account they are not trusted, especially those of
them in which some things are found that are even contrary
to the truth of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent
they do not belong to them.</p>


<p class="center">39. <i>About the Hebrew written characters which that language always possessed.</i></p>

<p>Now we must not believe that Heber, from whose name
the word Hebrew is derived, preserved and transmitted the
Hebrew language to Abraham only as a spoken language, and
that the Hebrew letters began with the giving of the law
through Moses; but rather that this language, along with its
letters, was preserved by that succession of fathers. Moses,
indeed, appointed some among the people of God to teach
letters, before they could know any letters of the divine law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
The Scripture calls these men &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, who may
be called in Latin <i>inductores</i> or <i>introductores</i> of letters, because
they, as it were, introduce them into the hearts of the
learners, or rather lead those whom they teach into them.
Therefore no nation could vaunt itself over our patriarchs and
prophets by any wicked vanity for the antiquity of its wisdom;
since not even Egypt, which is wont falsely and vainly to
glory in the antiquity of her doctrines, is found to have preceded
in time the wisdom of our patriarchs in her own wisdom,
such as it is. Neither will any one dare to say that they
were most skilful in wonderful sciences before they knew letters,
that is, before Isis came and taught them there. Besides, what,
for the most part, was that memorable doctrine of theirs which
was called wisdom but astronomy, and it may be some other
sciences of that kind, which usually have more power to exercise
men's wit than to enlighten their minds with true wisdom?
As regards philosophy, which professes to teach men something
which shall make them happy, studies of that kind flourished
in those lands about the times of Mercury whom they called
Trismegistus, long before the sages and philosophers of Greece,
but yet after Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and even
after Moses himself. At that time, indeed, when Moses was
born, Atlas is found to have lived, that great astronomer, the
brother of Prometheus, and maternal grandson of the elder
Mercury, of whom that Mercury Trismegistus was the grandson.</p>


<p class="center">40. <i>About the most mendacious vanity of the Egyptians, in which they ascribe to
their science an antiquity of a hundred thousand years.</i></p>

<p>In vain, then, do some babble with most empty presumption,
saying that Egypt has understood the reckoning of the
stars for more than a hundred thousand years. For in what
books have they collected that number who learned letters
from Isis their mistress, not much more than two thousand
years ago? Varro, who has declared this, is no small authority
in history, and it does not disagree with the truth of the
divine books. For as it is not yet six thousand years since
the first man, who is called Adam, are not those to be ridiculed
rather than refuted who try to persuade us of anything regarding
a space of time so different from, and contrary to, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
ascertained truth? For what historian of the past should
we credit more than him who has also predicted things to
come which we now see fulfilled? And the very disagreement
of the historians among themselves furnishes a good
reason why we ought rather to believe him who does not
contradict the divine history which we hold. But, on the
other hand, the citizens of the impious city, scattered everywhere
through the earth, when they read the most learned
writers, none of whom seems to be of contemptible authority,
and find them disagreeing among themselves about affairs
most remote from the memory of our age, cannot find out
whom they ought to trust. But we, being sustained by divine
authority in the history of our religion, have no doubt that
whatever is opposed to it is most false, whatever may be the
case regarding other things in secular books, which, whether
true or false, yield nothing of moment to our living rightly
and happily.</p>


<p class="center">41. <i>About the discord of philosophic opinion, and the concord of the Scriptures
that are held as canonical by the Church.</i></p>

<p>But let us omit further examination of history, and return
to the philosophers from whom we digressed to these things.
They seem to have laboured in their studies for no other
end than to find out how to live in a way proper for laying
hold of blessedness. Why, then, have the disciples dissented
from their masters, and the fellow-disciples from one
another, except because as men they have sought after these
things by human sense and human reasonings? Now,
although there might be among them a desire of glory, so
that each wished to be thought wiser and more acute than
another, and in no way addicted to the judgment of others,
but the inventor of his own dogma and opinion, yet I may
grant that there were some, or even very many of them,
whose love of truth severed them from their teachers or fellow-disciples,
that they might strive for what they thought
was the truth, whether it was so or not. But what can
human misery do, or how or where can it reach forth, so as
to attain blessedness, if divine authority does not lead it?
Finally, let our authors, among whom the canon of the sacred
books is fixed and bounded, be far from disagreeing in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
respect. It is not without good reason, then, that not merely
a few people prating in the schools and gymnasia in captious
disputations, but so many and great people, both learned and
unlearned, in countries and cities, have believed that God
spoke to them or by them, <i>i.e.</i> the canonical writers, when
they wrote these books. There ought, indeed, to be but few of
them, lest on account of their multitude what ought to be
religiously esteemed should grow cheap; and yet not so few
that their agreement should not be wonderful. For among
the multitude of philosophers, who in their works have left
behind them the monuments of their dogmas, no one will
easily find any who agree in all their opinions. But to show
this is too long a task for this work.</p>

<p>But what author of any sect is so approved in this demon-worshipping
city, that the rest who have differed from or opposed
him in opinion have been disapproved? The Epicureans
asserted that human affairs were not under the providence of
the gods; and the Stoics, holding the opposite opinion, agreed
that they were ruled and defended by favourable and tutelary
gods. Yet were not both sects famous among the Athenians?
I wonder, then, why Anaxagoras was accused of a crime for
saying that the sun was a burning stone, and denying that it
was a god at all; while in the same city Epicurus flourished
gloriously and lived securely, although he not only did not
believe that the sun or any star was a god, but contended
that neither Jupiter nor any of the gods dwelt in the world
at all, so that the prayers and supplications of men might
reach them! Were not both Aristippus and Antisthenes there,
two noble philosophers and both Socratic? yet they placed the
chief end of life within bounds so diverse and contradictory,
that the first made the delight of the body the chief good,
while the other asserted that man was made happy mainly
by the virtue of the mind. The one also said that the wise
man should flee from the republic; the other, that he should
administer its affairs. Yet did not each gather disciples to
follow his own sect? Indeed, in the conspicuous and well-known
porch, in gymnasia, in gardens, in places public and
private, they openly strove in bands each for his own opinion,
some asserting there was one world, others innumerable worlds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
some that this world had a beginning, others that it had
not; some that it would perish, others that it would exist
always; some that it was governed by the divine mind,
others by chance and accident; some that souls are immortal,
others that they are mortal,&mdash;and of those who asserted their
immortality, some said they transmigrated through beasts,
others that it was by no means so, while of those who asserted
their mortality, some said they perished immediately after the
body, others that they survived either a little while or a longer
time, but not always; some fixing supreme good in the body,
some in the mind, some in both; others adding to the mind
and body external good things; some thinking that the bodily
senses ought to be trusted always, some not always, others
never. Now what people, senate, power, or public dignity of
the impious city has ever taken care to judge between all
these and other well-nigh innumerable dissensions of the
philosophers, approving and accepting some, and disapproving
and rejecting others? Has it not held in its bosom at random,
without any judgment, and confusedly, so many controversies
of men at variance, not about fields, houses, or anything of
a pecuniary nature, but about those things which make life
either miserable or happy? Even if some true things were
said in it, yet falsehoods were uttered with the same licence;
so that such a city has not amiss received the title of the
mystic Babylon. For Babylon means confusion, as we remember
we have already explained. Nor does it matter to
the devil, its king, how they wrangle among themselves in
contradictory errors, since all alike deservedly belong to him
on account of their great and varied impiety.</p>

<p>But that nation, that people, that city, that republic, these
Israelites, to whom the oracles of God were entrusted, by no
means confounded with similar licence false prophets with the
true prophets; but, agreeing together, and differing in nothing,
acknowledged and upheld the authentic authors of their sacred
books. These were their philosophers, these were their sages,
divines, prophets, and teachers of probity and piety. Whoever
was wise and lived according to them was wise and lived
not according to men, but according to God who hath spoken
by them. If sacrilege is forbidden there, God hath forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
it. If it is said, "Honour thy father and thy mother,"<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> God
hath commanded it. If it is said, "Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal,"<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and other
similar commandments, not human lips but the divine oracles
have enounced them. Whatever truth certain philosophers,
amid their false opinions, were able to see, and strove by
laborious discussions to persuade men of,&mdash;such as that God
has made this world, and Himself most providently governs
it, or of the nobility of the virtues, of the love of country, of
fidelity in friendship, of good works and everything pertaining
to virtuous manners, although they knew not to what end
and what rule all these things were to be referred,&mdash;all these, by
words prophetic, that is, divine, although spoken by men, were
commended to the people in that city, and not inculcated by
contention in arguments, so that he who should know them
might be afraid of contemning, not the wit of men, but the
oracle of God.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap42"></a>42. <i>By what dispensation of God's providence the sacred Scriptures of the Old
Testament were translated out of Hebrew into Greek, that they might be
made known to all the nations.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, desired to know and
have these sacred books. For after Alexander of Macedon,
who is also styled the Great, had by his most wonderful, but
by no means enduring power, subdued the whole of Asia, yea,
almost the whole world, partly by force of arms, partly by
terror, and, among other kingdoms of the East, had entered and
obtained Judea also, on his death his generals did not peaceably
divide that most ample kingdom among them for a possession,
but rather dissipated it, wasting all things by wars.
Then Egypt began to have the Ptolemies as her kings. The
first of them, the son of Lagus, carried many captive out of
Judea into Egypt. But another Ptolemy, called Philadelphus,
who succeeded him, permitted all whom he had brought under
the yoke to return free; and, more than that, sent kingly gifts
to the temple of God, and begged Eleazar, who was the high
priest, to give him the Scriptures, which he had heard by
report were truly divine, and therefore greatly desired to have
in that most noble library he had made. When the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
priest had sent them to him in Hebrew, he afterwards demanded
interpreters of him, and there were given him seventy-two,
out of each of the twelve tribes six men, most learned in
both languages, to wit, the Hebrew and Greek; and their
translation is now by custom called the Septuagint. It is
reported, indeed, that there was an agreement in their words
so wonderful, stupendous, and plainly divine, that when they
had sat at this work, each one apart (for so it pleased Ptolemy
to test their fidelity), they differed from each other in no word
which had the same meaning and force, or in the order of the
words; but, as if the translators had been one, so what all had
translated was one, because in very deed the one Spirit had
been in them all. And they received so wonderful a gift of
God, in order that the authority of these Scriptures might be
commended not as human but divine, as indeed it was, for the
benefit of the nations who should at some time believe, as we
now see them doing.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>43. <i>Of the authority of the Septuagint translation, which, saving the honour
of the Hebrew original, is to be preferred to all translations.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>For while there were other interpreters who translated these
sacred oracles out of the Hebrew tongue into Greek, as Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion, and also that translation which,
as the name of the author is unknown, is quoted as the fifth
edition, yet the Church has received this Septuagint translation
just as if it were the only one; and it has been used by
the Greek Christian people, most of whom are not aware that
there is any other. From this translation there has also been
made a translation in the Latin tongue, which the Latin
churches use. Our times, however, have enjoyed the advantage
of the presbyter Jerome, a man most learned, and skilled
in all three languages, who translated these same Scriptures
into the Latin speech, not from the Greek, but from the
Hebrew. But although the Jews acknowledge this very
learned labour of his to be faithful, while they contend that
the Septuagint translators have erred in many places, still the
churches of Christ judge that no one should be preferred to
the authority of so many men, chosen for this very great work
by Eleazar, who was then high priest; for even if there had
not appeared in them one spirit, without doubt divine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the seventy learned men had, after the manner of men, compared
together the words of their translation, that what pleased
them all might stand, no single translator ought to be preferred
to them; but since so great a sign of divinity has
appeared in them, certainly, if any other translator of their
Scriptures from the Hebrew into any other tongue is faithful,
in that case he agrees with these seventy translators, and if
he is not found to agree with them, then we ought to believe
that the prophetic gift is with them. For the same Spirit
who was in the prophets when they spoke these things was
also in the seventy men when they translated them, so that
assuredly they could also say something else, just as if the
prophet himself had said both, because it would be the same
Spirit who said both; and could say the same thing differently,
so that, although the words were not the same, yet the same
meaning should shine forth to those of good understanding;
and could omit or add something, so that even by this it
might be shown that there was in that work not human
bondage, which the translator owed to the words, but rather
divine power, which filled and ruled the mind of the translator.
Some, however, have thought that the Greek copies of
the Septuagint version should be emended from the Hebrew
copies; yet they did not dare to take away what the Hebrew
lacked and the Septuagint had, but only added what was
found in the Hebrew copies and was lacking in the Septuagint,
and noted them by placing at the beginning of the verses
certain marks in the form of stars which they call asterisks.
And those things which the Hebrew copies have not, but the
Septuagint have, they have in like manner marked at the
beginning of the verses by horizontal spit-shaped marks like
those by which we denote ounces; and many copies having
these marks are circulated even in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> But we cannot,
without inspecting both kinds of copies, find out those things
which are neither omitted nor added, but expressed differently,
whether they yield another meaning not in itself unsuitable,
or can be shown to explain the same meaning in another way.
If, then, as it behoves us, we behold nothing else in these
Scriptures than what the Spirit of God has spoken through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
men, if anything is in the Hebrew copies and is not in the
version of the Seventy, the Spirit of God did not choose to
say it through them, but only through the prophets. But
whatever is in the Septuagint and not in the Hebrew copies,
the same Spirit chose rather to say through the latter, thus
showing that both were prophets. For in that manner He
spoke as He chose, some things through Isaiah, some through
Jeremiah, some through several prophets, or else the same
thing through this prophet and through that. Further, whatever
is found in both editions, that one and the same Spirit
willed to say through both, but so as that the former preceded
in prophesying, and the latter followed in prophetically
interpreting them; because, as the one Spirit of peace was in
the former when they spoke true and concordant words, so the
selfsame one Spirit hath appeared in the latter, when, without
mutual conference, they yet interpreted all things as if with
one mouth.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap44"></a>44. <i>How the threat of the destruction of the Ninevites is to be understood, which
in the Hebrew extends to forty days, while in the Septuagint it is contracted
to three.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But some one may say, "How shall I know whether the
prophet Jonah said to the Ninevites, 'Yet <i>three</i> days and Nineveh
shall be overthrown,' or <i>forty</i> days?"<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> For who does not see
that the prophet could not say both, when he was sent to
terrify the city by the threat of imminent ruin? For if its
destruction was to take place on the third day, it certainly
could not be on the fortieth; but if on the fortieth, then certainly
not on the third. If, then, I am asked which of these
Jonah may have said, I rather think what is read in the
Hebrew, "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
Yet the Seventy, interpreting long afterward, could say what
was different and yet pertinent to the matter, and agree in
the selfsame meaning, although under a different signification.
And this may admonish the reader not to despise the authority
of either, but to raise himself above the history, and search for
those things which the history itself was written to set forth.
These things, indeed, took place in the city of Nineveh, but
they also signified something else too great to apply to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
city; just as, when it happened that the prophet himself was
three days in the whale's belly, it signified besides, that He
who is Lord of all the prophets should be three days in the
depths of hell. Wherefore, if that city is rightly held as
prophetically representing the Church of the Gentiles, to wit,
as brought down by penitence, so as no longer to be what it
had been, since this was done by Christ in the Church of
the Gentiles, which Nineveh represented, Christ Himself was
signified both by the forty and by the three days: by the
forty, because He spent that number of days with His disciples
after the resurrection, and then ascended into heaven, but by
the three days, because He rose on the third day. So that, if
the reader desires nothing else than to adhere to the history
of events, he may be aroused from his sleep by the Septuagint
interpreters, as well as the prophets, to search into the depth
of the prophecy, as if they had said, In the forty days seek
Him in whom thou mayest also find the three days,&mdash;the one
thou wilt find in His ascension, the other in His resurrection.
Because that which could be most suitably signified by both
numbers, of which one is used by Jonah the prophet, the other
by the prophecy of the Septuagint version, the one and selfsame
Spirit hath spoken. I dread prolixity, so that I must
not demonstrate this by many instances in which the seventy
interpreters may be thought to differ from the Hebrew, and
yet, when well understood, are found to agree. For which
reason I also, according to my capacity, following the footsteps
of the apostles, who themselves have quoted prophetic
testimonies from both, that is, from the Hebrew and the
Septuagint, have thought that both should be used as authoritative,
since both are one, and divine. But let us now follow
out as we can what remains.</p>

<p>45. <i>That the Jews ceased to have prophets after the rebuilding of the temple,
and from that time until the birth of Christ were afflicted with continual
adversity, to prove that the building of another temple had been promised
by prophetic voices.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Jewish nation no doubt became worse after it ceased
to have prophets, just at the very time when, on the rebuilding
of the temple after the captivity in Babylon, it hoped to
become better. For so, indeed, did that carnal people understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
what was foretold by Haggai the prophet, saying, "The
glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the
former."<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Now, that this is said of the new testament, he
showed a little above, where he says, evidently promising
Christ, "And I will move all nations, and the desired One shall
come to all nations."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> In this passage the Septuagint translators,
giving another sense more suitable to the body than
the Head, that is, to the Church than to Christ, have said by
prophetic authority, "The things shall come that are chosen
of the Lord from all nations," that is, <i>men</i>, of whom Jesus
saith in the Gospel, "Many are called, but few are chosen."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
For by such chosen ones of the nations there is built, through
the new testament, with living stones, a house of God far
more glorious than that temple was which was constructed
by king Solomon, and rebuilt after the captivity. For this
reason, then, that nation had no prophets from that time,
but was afflicted with many plagues by kings of alien race,
and by the Romans themselves, lest they should fancy that
this prophecy of Haggai was fulfilled by that rebuilding of
the temple.</p>

<p>For not long after, on the arrival of Alexander, it was subdued,
when, although there was no pillaging, because they dared
not resist him, and thus, being very easily subdued, received
him peaceably, yet the glory of that house was not so great
as it was when under the free power of their own kings.
Alexander, indeed, offered up sacrifices in the temple of God,
not as a convert to His worship in true piety, but thinking,
with impious folly, that He was to be worshipped along with
false gods. Then Ptolemy son of Lagus, whom I have already
mentioned, after Alexander's death carried them captive into
Egypt. His successor, Ptolemy Philadelphus, most benevolently
dismissed them; and by him it was brought about,
as I have narrated a little before, that we should have the
Septuagint version of the Scriptures. Then they were crushed
by the wars which are explained in the books of the Maccabees.
Afterward they were taken captive by Ptolemy king of Alexandria,
who was called Epiphanes. Then Antiochus king of
Syria compelled them by many and most grievous evils to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
worship idols, and filled the temple itself with the sacrilegious
superstitions of the Gentiles. Yet their most vigorous leader
Judas, who is also called Maccabæus, after beating the generals
of Antiochus, cleansed it from all that defilement of idolatry.</p>

<p>But not long after, one Alcimus, although an alien from the
sacerdotal tribe, was, through ambition, made pontiff, which
was an impious thing. After almost fifty years, during which
they never had peace, although they prospered in some affairs,
Aristobulus first assumed the diadem among them, and was
made both king and pontiff. Before that, indeed, from the
time of their return from the Babylonish captivity and the
rebuilding of the temple, they had not kings, but generals or
<i>principes</i>. Although a king himself may be called a prince,
from his principality in governing, and a leader, because he
leads the army, but it does not follow that all who are princes
and leaders may also be called kings, as that Aristobulus was.
He was succeeded by Alexander, also both king and pontiff,
who is reported to have reigned over them cruelly. After
him his wife Alexandra was queen of the Jews, and from her
time downwards more grievous evils pursued them; for this
Alexandra's sons, Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, when contending
with each other for the kingdom, called in the Roman
forces against the nation of Israel. For Hyrcanus asked
assistance from them against his brother. At that time
Rome had already subdued Africa and Greece, and ruled
extensively in other parts of the world also, and yet, as if
unable to bear her own weight, had, in a manner, broken
herself by her own size. For indeed she had come to grave
domestic seditions, and from that to social wars, and by and
by to civil wars, and had enfeebled and worn herself out so
much, that the changed state of the republic, in which she
should be governed by kings, was now imminent. Pompey
then, a most illustrious prince of the Roman people, having
entered Judea with an army, took the city, threw open the
temple, not with the devotion of a suppliant, but with the
authority of a conqueror, and went, not reverently, but profanely,
into the holy of holies, where it was lawful for none
but the pontiff to enter. Having established Hyrcanus in the
pontificate, and set Antipater over the subjugated nation as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
guardian or procurator, as they were then called, he led
Aristobulus with him bound. From that time the Jews also
began to be Roman tributaries. Afterward Cassius plundered
the very temple. Then after a few years it was their desert
to have Herod, a king of foreign birth, in whose reign Christ
was born. For the time had now come signified by the
prophetic Spirit through the mouth of the patriarch Jacob,
when he says, "There shall not be lacking a prince out of
Judah, nor a teacher from his loins, until He shall come for
whom it is reserved; and He is the expectation of the nations."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
There lacked not therefore a Jewish prince of the Jews until
that Herod, who was the first king of a foreign race received
by them. Therefore it was now the time when He should
come for whom that was reserved which is promised in the
New Testament, that He should be the expectation of the
nations. But it was not possible that the nations should
expect He would come, as we see they did, to do judgment in
the splendour of power, unless they should first believe in
Him when He came to suffer judgment in the humility of
patience.</p>

<p>46. <i>Of the birth of our Saviour, whereby the Word was made flesh; and of the
dispersion of the Jews among all nations, as had been prophesied.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>While Herod, therefore, reigned in Judea, and Cæsar
Augustus was emperor at Rome, the state of the republic
being already changed, and the world being set at peace by
him, Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judah, man manifest out
of a human virgin, God hidden out of God the Father. For so
had the prophet foretold: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive in
the womb, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name
Immanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> He
did many miracles that He might commend God in Himself,
some of which, even as many as seemed sufficient to proclaim
Him, are contained in the evangelic Scripture. The first of
these is, that He was so wonderfully born, and the last, that
with His body raised up again from the dead He ascended
into heaven. But the Jews who slew Him, and would not
believe in Him, because it behoved Him to die and rise again,
were yet more miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
rooted out from their kingdom, where aliens had already
ruled over them, and were dispersed through the lands (so
that indeed there is no place where they are not), and are
thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have
not forged the prophecies about Christ. And very many of
them, considering this, even before His passion, but chiefly
after His resurrection, believed on Him, of whom it was predicted,
"Though the number of the children of Israel be as
the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> But the
rest are blinded, of whom it was predicted, "Let their table
be made before them a trap, and a retribution, and a stumbling-block.
Let their eyes be darkened lest they see, and bow
down their back alway."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Therefore, when they do not believe
our Scriptures, their own, which they blindly read, are
fulfilled in them, lest perchance any one should say that the
Christians have forged these prophecies about Christ which
are quoted under the name of the sibyl, or of others, if such
there be, who do not belong to the Jewish people. For us,
indeed, those suffice which are quoted from the books of our
enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account
of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute
by their possession of these books, while they themselves are
dispersed among all nations, wherever the Church of Christ
is spread abroad. For a prophecy about this thing was sent
before in the Psalms, which they also read, where it is written,
"My God, His mercy shall prevent me. My God hath shown
me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay them,
lest they should at last forget Thy law: disperse them in Thy
might."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Therefore God has shown the Church in her enemies
the Jews the grace of His compassion, since, as saith the
apostle, "their offence is the salvation of the Gentiles."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
And therefore He has not slain them, that is, He has not let
the knowledge that they are Jews be lost in them, although
they have been conquered by the Romans, lest they should
forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of no
avail in this matter of which we treat. But it was not
enough that he should say, "Slay them not, lest they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
at last forget Thy law," unless he had also added, "Disperse
them;" because if they had only been in their own land with
that testimony of the Scriptures, and not everywhere, certainly
the Church which is everywhere could not have had them as
witnesses among all nations to the prophecies which were
sent before concerning Christ.</p>


<p class="center">47. <i>Whether before Christian times there were any outside of the Israelite
race who belonged to the fellowship of the heavenly city.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore if we read of any foreigner&mdash;that is, one neither
born of Israel nor received by that people into the canon of
the sacred books&mdash;having prophesied something about Christ,
if it has come or shall come to our knowledge, we can refer
to it over and above; not that this is necessary, even if
wanting, but because it is not incongruous to believe that
even in other nations there may have been men to whom this
mystery was revealed, and who were also impelled to proclaim
it, whether they were partakers of the same grace or had no
experience of it, but were taught by bad angels, who, as we
know, even confessed the present Christ, whom the Jews did
not acknowledge. Nor do I think the Jews themselves dare
contend that no one has belonged to God except the Israelites,
since the increase of Israel began on the rejection of his elder
brother. For in very deed there was no other people who
were specially called the people of God; but they cannot
deny that there have been certain men even of other nations
who belonged, not by earthly but heavenly fellowship, to the
true Israelites, the citizens of the country that is above. Because,
if they deny this, they can be most easily confuted by
the case of the holy and wonderful man Job, who was neither
a native nor a proselyte, that is, a stranger joining the people
of Israel, but, being bred of the Idumean race, arose there
and died there too, and who is so praised by the divine oracle,
that no man of his times is put on a level with him as regards
justice and piety. And although we do not find his date in
the chronicles, yet from his book, which for its merit the
Israelites have received as of canonical authority, we gather
that he was in the third generation after Israel. And I
doubt not it was divinely provided, that from this one case
we might know that among other nations also there might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
men pertaining to the spiritual Jerusalem who have lived
according to God and have pleased Him. And it is not to
be supposed that this was granted to any one, unless the one
Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> was
divinely revealed to him; who was pre-announced to the saints
of old as yet to come in the flesh, even as He is announced
to us as having come, that the selfsame faith through Him
may lead all to God who are predestinated to be the city of
God, the house of God, and the temple of God. But whatever
prophecies concerning the grace of God through Christ
Jesus are quoted, they may be thought to have been forged
by the Christians. So that there is nothing of more weight
for confuting all sorts of aliens, if they contend about this
matter, and for supporting our friends, if they are truly wise,
than to quote those divine predictions about Christ which
are written in the books of the Jews, who have been torn from
their native abode and dispersed over the whole world in
order to bear this testimony, so that the Church of Christ has
everywhere increased.</p>

not in the rebuilding of the temple, but in the Church of Christ.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This house of God is more glorious than that first one
which was constructed of wood and stone, metals, and other
precious things. Therefore the prophecy of Haggai was not
fulfilled in the rebuilding of that temple. For it can never
be shown to have had so much glory after it was rebuilt as
it had in the time of Solomon; yea, rather, the glory of that
house is shown to have been diminished, first by the ceasing
of prophecy, and then by the nation itself suffering so great
calamities, even to the final destruction made by the Romans,
as the things above-mentioned prove. But this house which
pertains to the new testament is just as much more glorious
as the living stones, even believing, renewed men, of which it
is constructed are better. But it was typified by the rebuilding
of that temple for this reason, because the very renovation
of that edifice typifies in the prophetic oracle another testament
which is called the new. When, therefore, God said by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the prophet just named, "And I will give peace in this
place,"<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> He is to be understood who is typified by that typical
place; for since by that rebuilt place is typified the Church
which was to be built by Christ, nothing else can be accepted
as the meaning of the saying, "I will give peace in this
place," except I will give peace in the place which that place
signifies. For all typical things seem in some way to personate
those whom they typify, as it is said by the apostle,
"That Rock was Christ."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Therefore the glory of this new
testament house is greater than the glory of the old testament
house; and it will show itself as greater when it shall
be dedicated. For then "shall come the desired of all nations,"<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
as we read in the Hebrew. For before His advent
He had not yet been desired by all nations. For they knew
not Him whom they ought to desire, in whom they had not
believed. Then, also, according to the Septuagint interpretation
(for it also is a prophetic meaning), "shall come those
who are elected of the Lord out of all nations." For then
indeed there shall come only those who are elected, whereof
the apostle saith, "According as He hath chosen us in Him
before the foundation of the world."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> For the Master

did not say this of those who, on being called, came in such
a way as to be cast out from the feast, but would point out
the house built up of the elect, which henceforth shall dread
no ruin. Yet because the churches are also full of those who
shall be separated by the winnowing as in the threshing-floor,
the glory of this house is not so apparent now as it shall be
when every one who is there shall be there always.</p>


<p class="center">49. <i>Of the indiscriminate increase of the Church, wherein many reprobate are in
this world mixed with the elect.</i></p>

<p>In this wicked world, in these evil days, when the Church
measures her future loftiness by her present humility, and is
exercised by goading fears, tormenting sorrows, disquieting
labours, and dangerous temptations, when she soberly rejoices,
rejoicing only in hope, there are many reprobate mingled with
the good, and both are gathered together by the gospel as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
a drag net;<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and in this world, as in a sea, both swim enclosed
without distinction in the net, until it is brought ashore, when
the wicked must be separated from the good, that in the good,
as in His temple, God may be all in all. We acknowledge,
indeed, that His word is now fulfilled who spake in the psalm,
and said, "I have announced and spoken; they are multiplied
above number."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> This takes place now, since He has spoken,

His own mouth, saying, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven
is at hand."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> He chose disciples, whom He also called apostles,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>
of lowly birth, unhonoured, and illiterate, so that whatever
great thing they might be or do, He might be and do it in
them. He had one among them whose wickedness He could
use well in order to accomplish His appointed passion, and
furnish His Church an example of bearing with the wicked.
Having sown the holy gospel as much as that behoved to be
done by His bodily presence, He suffered, died, and rose again,
showing by His passion what we ought to suffer for the truth,
and by His resurrection what we ought to hope for in adversity;
saving always the mystery of the sacrament, by which
His blood was shed for the remission of sins. He held converse
on the earth forty days with His disciples, and in their
sight ascended into heaven, and after ten days sent the promised
Holy Spirit. It was given as the chief and most necessary
sign of His coming on those who had believed, that every
one of them spoke in the tongues of all nations; thus signifying
that the unity of the catholic Church would embrace all
nations, and would in like manner speak in all tongues.</p>

and the prediction of the Lord Christ Himself, when, after the
resurrection, "He opened the understanding" of His amazed
disciples "that they might understand the Scriptures, and
said unto them that thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> And
again, when, in reply to their questioning about the day of
His last coming, He said, "It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own
power; but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost
coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even unto the
ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> First of all, the Church spread herself
abroad from Jerusalem; and when very many in Judea and
Samaria had believed, she also went into other nations by
those who announced the gospel, whom, as lights, He Himself
had both prepared by His word and kindled by His Holy
Spirit. For He had said to them, "Fear ye not them which
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> And that
they might not be frozen with fear, they burned with the fire
of charity. Finally, the gospel of Christ was preached in the
whole world, not only by those who had seen and heard Him
both before His passion and after His resurrection, but also after
their death by their successors, amid the horrible persecutions,
diverse torments and deaths of the martyrs, God also bearing
them witness, both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles
and gifts of the Holy Ghost,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> that the people of the nations,
believing in Him who was crucified for their redemption, might
venerate with Christian love the blood of the martyrs which
they had poured forth with devilish fury, and the very kings
by whose laws the Church had been laid waste might become
profitably subject to that name they had cruelly striven to
take away from the earth, and might begin to persecute the
false gods for whose sake the worshippers of the true God had
formerly been persecuted.</p>


<p class="center">51. <i>That the catholic faith may be confirmed even by the dissensions of the

the city of God indifferently without any correction, just as
the city of confusion indifferently held the philosophers who
were of diverse and adverse opinions. Those, therefore, in
the Church of Christ who savour anything morbid and depraved,
and, on being corrected that they may savour what
is wholesome and right, contumaciously resist, and will not
amend their pestiferous and deadly dogmas, but persist in defending
them, become heretics, and, going without, are to be
reckoned as enemies who serve for her discipline. For even
thus they profit by their wickedness those true catholic members
of Christ, since God makes a good use even of the wicked,
and all things work together for good to them that love Him.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
For all the enemies of the Church, whatever error blinds or
malice depraves them, exercise her patience if they receive
the power to afflict her corporally; and if they only oppose
her by wicked thought, they exercise her wisdom: but at
the same time, if these enemies are loved, they exercise her
benevolence, or even her beneficence, whether she deals with
them by persuasive doctrine or by terrible discipline. And
thus the devil, the prince of the impious city, when he stirs
up his own vessels against the city of God that sojourns in
this world, is permitted to do her no harm. For without
doubt the divine providence procures for her both consolation
through prosperity, that she may not be broken by adversity,
and trial through adversity, that she may not be corrupted by
prosperity; and thus each is tempered by the other, as we
recognise in the Psalms that voice which arises from no other
cause, "According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart,
Thy consolations have delighted my soul."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Hence also is

who are without do not rage, and thus there seems to be, and
really is, tranquillity, which brings very much consolation,
especially to the weak, yet there are not wanting, yea, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
are many within who by their abandoned manners torment
the hearts of those who live piously, since by them the
Christian and catholic name is blasphemed; and the dearer
that name is to those who will live piously in Christ, the
more do they grieve that through the wicked, who have a
place within, it comes to be less loved than pious minds
desire. The heretics themselves also, since they are thought
to have the Christian name and sacraments, Scriptures, and
profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both
because many who wish to be Christians are compelled by
their dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find
in them matter for blaspheming the Christian name, because
they too are at any rate <i>called</i> Christians. By these and
similar depraved manners and errors of men, those who will
live piously in Christ suffer persecution, even when no one
molests or vexes their body; for they suffer this persecution,
not in their bodies, but in their hearts. Whence is that word,
"According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart;" for
he does not say, in my body. Yet, on the other hand, none
of them can perish, because the immutable divine promises
are thought of. And because the apostle says, "The Lord
knoweth them that are His;<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> for whom He did foreknow, He
also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His
Son,"<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> none of them can perish; therefore it follows in that
psalm, "Thy consolations have delighted my soul."<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But
that grief which arises in the hearts of the pious, who are
persecuted by the manners of bad or false Christians, is profitable
to the sufferers, because it proceeds from the charity
in which they do not wish them either to perish or to hinder
the salvation of others. Finally, great consolations grow out
of their chastisement, which imbue the souls of the pious
with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were
troubled concerning their own perdition. Thus in this world,
in these evil days, not only from the time of the bodily presence
of Christ and His apostles, but even from that of Abel,
whom first his wicked brother slew because he was righteous,<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
and thenceforth even to the end of this world, the Church has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
gone forward on pilgrimage amid the persecutions of the
world and the consolations of God.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>52. <i>Whether we should believe what some think, that, as the ten persecutions which
are past have been fulfilled, there remains no other beyond the eleventh,
which must happen in the very time of Antichrist.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I do not think, indeed, that what some have thought or
may think is rashly said or believed, that until the time of
Antichrist the Church of Christ is not to suffer any persecutions
besides those she has already suffered,&mdash;that is, <i>ten</i>,&mdash;and
that the eleventh and last shall be inflicted by Antichrist.
They reckon as the first that made by Nero, the second by
Domitian, the third by Trajan, the fourth by Antoninus, the
fifth by Severus, the sixth by Maximin, the seventh by Decius,
the eighth by Valerian, the ninth by Aurelian, the tenth by
Diocletian and Maximian. For as there were ten plagues
in Egypt before the people of God could begin to go out,
they think this is to be referred to as showing that the last
persecution by Antichrist must be like the eleventh plague,
in which the Egyptians, while following the Hebrews with
hostility, perished in the Red Sea when the people of God
passed through on dry land. Yet I do not think persecutions
were prophetically signified by what was done in Egypt, however
nicely and ingeniously those who think so may seem to
have compared the two in detail, not by the prophetic Spirit,
but by the conjecture of the human mind, which sometimes
hits the truth, and sometimes is deceived. But what can
those who think this say of the persecution in which the
Lord Himself was crucified? In which number will they
put it? And if they think the reckoning is to be made exclusive
of this one, as if those must be counted which pertain
to the body, and not that in which the Head Himself was set
upon and slain, what can they make of that one which, after
Christ ascended into heaven, took place in Jerusalem, when
the blessed Stephen was stoned; when James the brother of
John was slaughtered with the sword; when the Apostle
Peter was imprisoned to be killed, and was set free by the
angel; when the brethren were driven away and scattered
from Jerusalem; when Saul, who afterward became the
Apostle Paul, wasted the Church; and when he himself, publishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
the glad tidings of the faith he had persecuted, suffered
such things as he had inflicted, either from the Jews or from
other nations, where he most fervently preached Christ everywhere?
Why, then, do they think fit to start with Nero,
when the Church in her growth had reached the times of
Nero amid the most cruel persecutions, about which it would
be too long to say anything? But if they think that only
the persecutions made by kings ought to be reckoned, it was
king Herod who also made a most grievous one after the
ascension of the Lord. And what account do they give of
Julian, whom they do not number in the ten? Did not he
persecute the Church, who forbade the Christians to teach or
learn liberal letters? Under him, the elder Valentinian, who
was the third emperor after him, stood forth as a confessor of
the Christian faith, and was dismissed from his command in
the army. I shall say nothing of what he did at Antioch,
except to mention his being struck with wonder at the freedom
and cheerfulness of one most faithful and stedfast young
man, who, when many were seized to be tortured, was tortured
during a whole day, and sang under the instrument of torture,
until the emperor feared lest he should succumb under the
continued cruelties and put him to shame at last, which made
him dread and fear that he would be yet more dishonourably
put to the blush by the rest. Lastly, within our own recollection,
did not Valens the Arian, brother of the foresaid
Valentinian, waste the catholic Church by great persecution
throughout the East? But how unreasonable it is not to
consider that the Church, which bears fruit and grows through
the whole world, may suffer persecution from kings in some
nations even when she does not suffer it in others! Perhaps,
however, it was not to be reckoned a persecution when the
king of the Goths, in Gothia itself, persecuted the Christians
with wonderful cruelty, when there were none but catholics
there, of whom very many were crowned with martyrdom, as we
have heard from certain brethren who had been there at that
time as boys, and unhesitatingly called to mind that they had
seen these things? And what took place in Persia of late?
Was not persecution so hot against the Christians (if even yet
it is allayed) that some of the fugitives from it came even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Roman towns? When I think of these and the like things,
it does not seem to me that the number of persecutions with
which the Church is to be tried can be definitely stated. But,
on the other hand, it is no less rash to affirm that there will
be some persecutions by kings besides that last one, about
which no Christian is in doubt. Therefore we leave this undecided,
supporting or refuting neither side of this question,
but only restraining men from the audacious presumption of
affirming either of them.</p>


<p class="center">53. <i>Of the hidden time of the final persecution.</i></p>

<p>Truly Jesus Himself shall extinguish by His presence that
last persecution which is to be made by Antichrist. For so
it is written, that "He shall slay him with the breath of His
mouth, and empty him with the brightness of His presence."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
It is customary to ask, When shall that be? But this is
quite unreasonable. For had it been profitable for us to
know this, by whom could it better have been told than by
God Himself, the Master, when the disciples questioned Him?
For they were not silent when with Him, but inquired of
Him, saying, "Lord, wilt Thou at this time present the kingdom
to Israel, or when?"<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> But He said, "It is not for you
to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own
power." When they got that answer, they had not at all
questioned Him about the hour, or day, or year, but about the
time. In vain, then, do we attempt to compute definitely the
years that may remain to this world, when we may hear from
the mouth of the Truth that it is not for us to know this.
Yet some have said that four hundred, some five hundred,
others a thousand years, may be completed from the ascension
of the Lord up to His final coming. But to point out how
each of them supports his own opinion would take too long,
and is not necessary; for indeed they use human conjectures,
and bring forward nothing certain from the authority of the
canonical Scriptures. But on this subject He puts aside the
figures of the calculators, and orders silence, who says, "It is
not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in
His own power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>But because this sentence is in the Gospel, it is no wonder
that the worshippers of the many and false gods have been
none the less restrained from feigning that by the responses
of the demons, whom they worship as gods, it has been fixed
how long the Christian religion is to last. For when they
saw that it could not be consumed by so many and great persecutions,
but rather drew from them wonderful enlargements,
they invented I know not what Greek verses, as if poured
forth by a divine oracle to some one consulting it, in which,
indeed, they make Christ innocent of this, as it were, sacrilegious
crime, but add that Peter by enchantments brought it
about that the name of Christ should be worshipped for three
hundred and sixty-five years, and, after the completion of
that number of years, should at once take end. Oh the hearts
of learned men! Oh, learned wits, meet to believe such things
<i>about</i> Christ as you are not willing to believe <i>in</i> Christ, that
His disciple Peter did not learn magic arts from Him, yet
that, although He was innocent, His disciple was an enchanter,
and chose that His name rather than his own should be worshipped
through his magic arts, his great labours and perils,
and at last even the shedding of his blood! If Peter the
enchanter made the world so love Christ, what did Christ the
innocent do to make Peter so love Him? Let them answer
themselves then, and, if they can, let them understand that
the world, for the sake of eternal life, was made to love Christ
by that same supernal grace which made Peter also love
Christ for the sake of the eternal life to be received from
Him, and that even to the extent of suffering temporal death
for Him. And then, what kind of gods are these who are
able to predict such things, yet are not able to avert them,
succumbing in such a way to a single enchanter and wicked
magician (who, as they say, having slain a yearling boy and
torn him to pieces, buried him with nefarious rites), that
they permitted the sect hostile to themselves to gain strength
for so great a time, and to surmount the horrid cruelties of so
many great persecutions, not by resisting but by suffering, and
to procure the overthrow of their own images, temples, rituals,
and oracles? Finally, what god was it&mdash;not ours, certainly,
but one of their own&mdash;who was either enticed or compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
by so great wickedness to perform these things? For those
verses say that Peter bound, not any demon, but a god to do
these things. Such a god have they who have not Christ.</p>


<p class="center">54. <i>Of the very foolish lie of the pagans, in feigning that the Christian religion
was not to last beyond three hundred and sixty-five years.</i></p>

<p>I might collect these and many similar arguments, if that
year had not already passed by which lying divination has
promised, and deceived vanity has believed. But as a few
years ago three hundred and sixty-five years were completed
since the time when the worship of the name of Christ was
established by His presence in the flesh, and by the apostles,
what other proof need we seek to refute that falsehood? For,
not to place the beginning of this period at the nativity of
Christ, because as an infant and boy He had no disciples, yet,
when He began to have them, beyond doubt the Christian
doctrine and religion then became known through His bodily
presence, that is, after He was baptized in the river Jordan
by the ministry of John. For on this account that prophecy
went before concerning Him: "He shall reign from sea even
to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
But since, before He suffered and rose from the dead, the faith
had not yet been defined to all, but was defined in the resurrection
of Christ (for so the Apostle Paul speaks to the
Athenians, saying, "But now He announces to men that all
everywhere should repent, because He hath appointed a day
in which to judge the world in equity, by the Man in whom
He hath defined the faith to all men, raising Him from the
dead"<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>), it is better that, in settling this question, we should
start from that point, especially because the Holy Spirit was
then given, just as He behoved to be given after the resurrection
of Christ in that city from which the second law, that
is, the new testament, ought to begin. For the first, which
is called the old testament, was given from Mount Sinai
through Moses. But concerning this which was to be given
by Christ it was predicted, "Out of Sion shall go forth the
law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem;"<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> whence
He Himself said, that repentance in His name behoved to be
preached among all nations, but yet beginning at Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
There, therefore, the worship of this name took its rise, that
Jesus should be believed in, who died and rose again. There
this faith blazed up with such noble beginnings, that several
thousand men, being converted to the name of Christ with
wonderful alacrity, sold their goods for distribution among the
needy, thus, by a holy resolution and most ardent charity,
coming to voluntary poverty, and prepared themselves, amid
the Jews who raged and thirsted for their blood, to contend
for the truth even to death, not with armed power, but with
more powerful patience. If this was accomplished by no
magic arts, why do they hesitate to believe that the other
could be done throughout the whole world by the same divine
power by which this was done? But supposing Peter wrought
that enchantment so that so great a multitude of men at
Jerusalem was thus kindled to worship the name of Christ,
who had either seized and fastened Him to the cross, or reviled
Him when fastened there, we must still inquire when
the three hundred and sixty-five years must be completed,
counting from that year. Now Christ died when the Gemini
were consuls, on the eighth day before the kalends of April.
He rose the third day, as the apostles have proved by the
evidence of their own senses. Then forty days after, He
ascended into heaven. Ten days after, that is, on the fiftieth
after His resurrection, He sent the Holy Spirit; then three
thousand men believed when the apostles preached Him.
Then, therefore, arose the worship of that name, as we believe,
and according to the real truth, by the efficacy of the
Holy Spirit, but, as impious vanity has feigned or thought,
by the magic arts of Peter. A little afterward, too, on a
wonderful sign being wrought, when at Peter's own word a
certain beggar, so lame from his mother's womb that he was
carried by others and laid down at the gate of the temple,
where he begged alms, was made whole in the name of Jesus
Christ, and leaped up, five thousand men believed, and thenceforth
the Church grew by sundry accessions of believers. Thus
we gather the very day with which that year began, namely,
that on which the Holy Spirit was sent, that is, during the
ides of May. And, on counting the consuls, the three hundred
and sixty-five years are found completed on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
ides in the consulate of Honorius and Eutychianus. Now, in
the following year, in the consulate of Mallius Theodorus,
when, according to that oracle of the demons or figment of
men, there ought already to have been no Christian religion,
it was not necessary to inquire what perchance was done in
other parts of the earth. But, as we know, in the most noted
and eminent city Carthage, in Africa, Gaudentius and Jovius,
officers of the Emperor Honorius, on the fourteenth day before
the kalends of April, overthrew the temples and broke the
images of the false gods. And from that time to the present,
during almost thirty years, who does not see how much the
worship of the name of Christ has increased, especially after
many of those became Christians who had been kept back from
the faith by thinking that divination true, but saw when that
same number of years was completed that it was empty and
ridiculous? We, therefore, who are called and <i>are</i> Christians,
do not believe in Peter, but in Him whom Peter believed,&mdash;being
edified by Peter's sermons about Christ, not poisoned by
his incantations; and not deceived by his enchantments, but
aided by his good deeds. Christ Himself, who was Peter's
Master in the doctrine which leads to eternal life, is our
Master too.</p>

<p>But let us now at last finish this book, after thus far treating
of, and showing as far as seemed sufficient, what is the
mortal course of the two cities, the heavenly and the earthly,
which are mingled together from the beginning down to the
end. Of these, the earthly one has made to herself of whom
she would, either from any other quarter, or even from among
men, false gods whom she might serve by sacrifice; but she
which is heavenly, and is a pilgrim on the earth, does not
make false gods, but is herself made by the true God, of
whom she herself must be the true sacrifice. Yet both alike
either enjoy temporal good things, or are afflicted with temporal
evils, but with diverse faith, diverse hope, and diverse
love, until they must be separated by the last judgment, and
each must receive her own end, of which there is no end.
About these ends of both we must next treat.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>1. <i>That Varro has made out that two hundred and eighty-eight different sects
of philosophy might be formed by the various opinions regarding the
supreme good.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>As I see that I have still to discuss the fit destinies of the
two cities, the earthly and the heavenly, I must first
explain, so far as the limits of this work allow me, the reasonings
by which men have attempted to make for themselves a
happiness in this unhappy life, in order that it may be evident,
not only from divine authority, but also from such reasons
as can be adduced to unbelievers, how the empty dreams of
the philosophers differ from the hope which God gives to us,
and from the substantial fulfilment of it which He will give
us as our blessedness. Philosophers have expressed a great
variety of diverse opinions regarding the ends of goods and of
evils, and this question they have eagerly canvassed, that they
might, if possible, discover what makes a man happy. For
the end of our good is that for the sake of which other things
are to be desired, while it is to be desired for its own sake;
and the end of evil is that on account of which other things
are to be shunned, while it is avoided on its own account.
Thus, by the <i>end of good</i>, we at present mean, not that by
which good is destroyed, so that it no longer exists, but that
by which it is finished, so that it becomes complete; and by
the <i>end of evil</i> we mean, not that which abolishes it, but that
which completes its development. These two ends, therefore,
are the supreme good and the supreme evil; and, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
said, those who have in this vain life professed the study of
wisdom have been at great pains to discover these ends, and
to obtain the supreme good and avoid the supreme evil in
this life. And although they erred in a variety of ways, yet
natural insight has prevented them from wandering from the
truth so far that they have not placed the supreme good and
evil, some in the soul, some in the body, and some in both.
From this tripartite distribution of the sects of philosophy,
Marcus Varro, in his book <i>De Philosophia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> has drawn so large
a variety of opinions, that, by a subtle and minute analysis of
distinctions, he numbers without difficulty as many as 288
sects,&mdash;not that these have actually existed, but sects which
are possible.</p>

<p>To illustrate briefly what he means, I must begin with his
own introductory statement in the above-mentioned book,
that there are four things which men desire, as it were by
nature without a master, without the help of any instruction,
without industry or the art of living which is called virtue,
and which is certainly learned:<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> either pleasure, which is
an agreeable stirring of the bodily sense; or repose, which
excludes every bodily inconvenience; or both these, which
Epicurus calls by the one name, pleasure; or the primary
objects of nature,<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> which comprehend the things already named
and other things, either bodily, such as health, and safety, and
integrity of the members, or spiritual, such as the greater and
less mental gifts that are found in men. Now these four
things&mdash;pleasure, repose, the two combined, and the primary
objects of nature&mdash;exist in us in such sort that we must either
desire virtue on their account, or them for the sake of virtue,
or both for their own sake; and consequently there arise from
this distinction twelve sects, for each is by this consideration
tripled. I will illustrate this in one instance, and, having
done so, it will not be difficult to understand the others.
According, then, as bodily pleasure is subjected, preferred, or
united to virtue, there are three sects. It is subjected to
virtue when it is chosen as subservient to virtue. Thus it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
a duty of virtue to live for one's country, and for its sake to
beget children, neither of which can be done without bodily
pleasure. For there is pleasure in eating and drinking, pleasure
also in sexual intercourse. But when it is preferred to
virtue, it is desired for its own sake, and virtue is chosen only
for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment or
preservation of bodily pleasure. And this, indeed, is to make
life hideous; for where virtue is the slave of pleasure it no
longer deserves the name of virtue. Yet even this disgraceful
distortion has found some philosophers to patronize and
defend it. Then virtue is united to pleasure when neither is
desired for the other's sake, but both for their own. And
therefore, as pleasure, according as it is subjected, preferred, or
united to virtue, makes three sects, so also do repose, pleasure
and repose combined, and the prime natural blessings,
make their three sects each. For as men's opinions vary, and
these four things are sometimes subjected, sometimes preferred,
and sometimes united to virtue, there are produced twelve
sects. But this number again is doubled by the addition of
one difference, viz. the social life; for whoever attaches himself
to any of these sects does so either for his own sake alone,
or for the sake of a companion, for whom he ought to wish
what he desires for himself. And thus there will be twelve
of those who think some one of these opinions should be held
for their own sakes, and other twelve who decide that they
ought to follow this or that philosophy not for their own sakes
only, but also for the sake of others whose good they desire as
their own. These twenty-four sects again are doubled, and
become forty-eight by adding a difference taken from the New
Academy. For each of these four and twenty sects can hold
and defend their opinion as certain, as the Stoics defended the
position that the supreme good of man consisted solely in
virtue; or they can be held as probable, but not certain, as
the New Academics did. There are, therefore, twenty-four
who hold their philosophy as certainly true, other twenty-four
who hold their opinions as probable, but not certain.
Again, as each person who attaches himself to any of these
sects may adopt the mode of life either of the Cynics or of
the other philosophers, this distinction will double the number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and so make ninety-six sects. Then, lastly, as each of these
sects may be adhered to either by men who love a life of ease,
as those who have through choice or necessity addicted themselves
to study, or by men who love a busy life, as those who,
while philosophizing, have been much occupied with state
affairs and public business, or by men who choose a mixed life,
in imitation of those who have apportioned their time partly
to erudite leisure, partly to necessary business: by these differences
the number of the sects is tripled, and becomes 288.</p>

<p>I have thus, as briefly and lucidly as I could, given in my
own words the opinions which Varro expresses in his book.
But how he refutes all the rest of these sects, and chooses one,
the Old Academy, instituted by Plato, and continuing to
Polemo, the fourth teacher of that school of philosophy which
held that their system was certain; and how on this ground
he distinguishes it from the New Academy,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> which began with
Polemo's successor Arcesilaus, and held that all things are uncertain;
and how he seeks to establish that the Old Academy
was as free from error as from doubt,&mdash;all this, I say, were too
long to enter upon in detail, and yet I must not altogether
pass it by in silence. Varro then rejects, as a first step, all
those differences which have multiplied the number of sects;
and the ground on which he does so is that they are not differences
about the supreme good. He maintains that in
philosophy a sect is created only by its having an opinion of
its own different from other schools on the point of the ends-in-chief.
For man has no other reason for philosophizing
than that he may be happy; but that which makes him happy
is itself the supreme good. In other words, the supreme good
is the reason of philosophizing; and therefore that cannot be
called a sect of philosophy which pursues no way of its own
towards the supreme good. Thus, when it is asked whether a
wise man will adopt the social life, and desire and be interested
in the supreme good of his friend as in his own, or
will, on the contrary, do all that he does merely for his own
sake, there is no question here about the supreme good, but
only about the propriety of associating or not associating a
friend in its participation: whether the wise man will do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
not for his own sake, but for the sake of his friend in whose
good he delights as in his own. So, too, when it is asked
whether all things about which philosophy is concerned are
to be considered uncertain, as by the New Academy, or certain,
as the other philosophers maintain, the question here is
not what end should be pursued, but whether or not we are to
believe in the substantial existence of that end; or, to put it
more plainly, whether he who pursues the supreme good must
maintain that it is a true good, or only that it appears to him
to be true, though possibly it may be delusive,&mdash;both pursuing
one and the same good. The distinction, too, which is founded
on the dress and manners of the Cynics, does not touch the
question of the chief good, but only the question whether he
who pursues that good which seems to himself true should
live as do the Cynics. There were, in fact, men who, though
they pursued different things as the supreme good, some
choosing pleasure, others virtue, yet adopted that mode of life
which gave the Cynics their name. Thus, whatever it is
which distinguishes the Cynics from other philosophers, this
has no bearing on the choice and pursuit of that good which
constitutes happiness. For if it had any such bearing, then
the same habits of life would necessitate the pursuit of the
same chief good, and diverse habits would necessitate the pursuit
of different ends.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>2. <i>How Varro, by removing all the differences which do not form sects, but are
merely secondary questions, reaches three definitions of the chief good, of
which we must choose one.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The same may be said of those three kinds of life, the life
of studious leisure and search after truth, the life of easy
engagement in affairs, and the life in which both these are
mingled. When it is asked, which of these should be adopted,
this involves no controversy about the end of good, but inquires
which of these three puts a man in the best position for finding
and retaining the supreme good. For this good, as soon as
a man finds it, makes him happy; but lettered leisure, or public
business, or the alternation of these, do not necessarily constitute
happiness. Many, in fact, find it possible to adopt one
or other of these modes of life, and yet to miss what makes a
man happy. The question, therefore, regarding the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
good and the supreme evil, and which distinguishes sects of
philosophy, is one; and these questions concerning the social
life, the doubt of the Academy, the dress and food of the
Cynics, the three modes of life&mdash;the active, the contemplative,
and the mixed&mdash;these are different questions, into none of
which the question of the chief good enters. And therefore,
as Marcus Varro multiplied the sects to the number of 288
(or whatever larger number he chose) by introducing these
four differences derived from the social life, the New Academy,
the Cynics, and the threefold form of life, so, by removing
these differences as having no bearing on the supreme good,
and as therefore not constituting what can properly be called
sects, he returns to those twelve schools which concern themselves
with inquiring what that good is which makes man
happy, and he shows that one of these is true, the rest false.
In other words, he dismisses the distinction founded on the
threefold mode of life, and so decreases the whole number by
two-thirds, reducing the sects to ninety-six. Then, putting
aside the Cynic peculiarities, the number decreases by a half,
to forty-eight. Taking away next the distinction occasioned
by the hesitancy of the New Academy, the number is again
halved, and reduced to twenty-four. Treating in a similar
way the diversity introduced by the consideration of the
social life, there are left but twelve, which this difference had
doubled to twenty-four. Regarding these twelve, no reason
can be assigned why they should not be called sects. For in
them the sole inquiry is regarding the supreme good and the
ultimate evil,&mdash;that is to say, regarding the supreme good, for
this being found, the opposite evil is thereby found. Now, to
make these twelve sects, he multiplies by three these four
things&mdash;pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the
primary objects of nature which Varro calls <i>primigenia</i>. For
as these four things are sometimes subordinated to virtue, so
that they seem to be desired not for their own sake, but for
virtue's sake; sometimes preferred to it, so that virtue seems
to be necessary not on its own account, but in order to attain
these things; sometimes joined with it, so that both they and
virtue are desired for their own sakes,&mdash;we must multiply the
four by three, and thus we get twelve sects. But from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
four things Varro eliminates three&mdash;pleasure, repose, pleasure
and repose combined&mdash;not because he thinks these are not
worthy of the place assigned them, but because they are
included in the primary objects of nature. And what need
is there, at any rate, to make a threefold division out of these
two ends, pleasure and repose, taking them first severally and
then conjunctly, since both they, and many other things besides,
are comprehended in the primary objects of nature? Which
of the three remaining sects must be chosen? This is the
question that Varro dwells upon. For whether one of these
three or some other be chosen, reason forbids that more than
one be true. This we shall afterwards see; but meanwhile
let us explain as briefly and distinctly as we can how Varro
makes his selection from these three, that is, from the sects
which severally hold that the primary objects of nature are to
be desired for virtue's sake, that virtue is to be desired for
their sake, and that virtue and these objects are to be desired
each for their own sake.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>3. <i>Which of the three leading opinions regarding the chief good should be preferred,
according to Varro, who follows Antiochus and the Old Academy.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Which of these three is true and to be adopted he attempts
to show in the following manner. As it is the supreme
good, not of a tree, or of a beast, or of a god, but of man,
that philosophy is in quest of, he thinks that, first of all,
we must define man. He is of opinion that there are two
parts in human nature, body and soul, and makes no doubt
that of these two the soul is the better and by far the more
worthy part. But whether the soul alone is the man, so that
the body holds the same relation to it as a horse to the
horseman, this he thinks has to be ascertained. The horseman
is not a horse and a man, but only a man, yet he is
called a horseman, because he is in some relation to the horse.
Again, is the body alone the man, having a relation to the
soul such as the cup has to the drink? For it is not the cup
and the drink it contains which are called the cup, but the
cup alone; yet it is so called because it is made to hold the
drink. Or, lastly, is it neither the soul alone nor the body
alone, but both together, which are man, the body and the soul
being each a part, but the whole man being both together, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
we call two horses yoked together a pair, of which pair the
near and the off horse is each a part, but we do not call either
of them, no matter how connected with the other, a pair, but
only both together? Of these three alternatives, then, Varro
chooses the third, that man is neither the body alone, nor the
soul alone, but both together. And therefore the highest good,
in which lies the happiness of man, is composed of goods
of both kinds, both bodily and spiritual. And consequently
he thinks that the primary objects of nature are to be sought
for their own sake, and that virtue, which is the art of living,
and can be communicated by instruction, is the most excellent
of spiritual goods. This virtue, then, or art of regulating life,
when it has received these primary objects of nature which
existed independently of it, and prior to any instruction,
seeks them all, and itself also, for its own sake; and it uses
them, as it also uses itself, that from them all it may derive
profit and enjoyment, greater or less, according as they are
themselves greater or less; and while it takes pleasure in all
of them, it despises the less that it may obtain or retain the
greater when occasion demands. Now, of all goods, spiritual
or bodily, there is none at all to compare with virtue. For
virtue makes a good use both of itself and of all other goods
in which lies man's happiness; and where it is absent, no
matter how many good things a man has, they are not for his
good, and consequently should not be called good things while
they belong to one who makes them useless by using them
badly. The life of man, then, is called happy when it enjoys
virtue and these other spiritual and bodily good things without
which virtue is impossible. It is called happier if it enjoys
some or many other good things which are not essential to
virtue; and happiest of all, if it lacks not one of the good
things which pertain to the body and the soul. For life is
not the same thing as virtue, since not every life, but a wisely
regulated life, is virtue; and yet, while there can be life of
some kind without virtue, there cannot be virtue without life.
This I might apply to memory and reason, and such mental
faculties; for these exist prior to instruction, and without them
there cannot be any instruction, and consequently no virtue,
since virtue is learned. But bodily advantages, such as swiftness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of foot, beauty, or strength, are not essential to virtue,
neither is virtue essential to them, and yet they are good
things; and, according to our philosophers, even these advantages
are desired by virtue for its own sake, and are used and
enjoyed by it in a becoming manner.</p>

<p>They say that this happy life is also social, and loves the
advantages of its friends as its own, and for their sake wishes
for them what it desires for itself, whether these friends live
in the same family, as a wife, children, domestics; or in the
locality where one's home is, as the citizens of the same town;
or in the world at large, as the nations bound in common human
brotherhood; or in the universe itself, comprehended in the
heavens and the earth, as those whom they call gods, and
provide as friends for the wise man, and whom we more
familiarly call angels. Moreover, they say that, regarding the
supreme good and evil, there is no room for doubt, and that
they therefore differ from the New Academy in this respect,
and they are not concerned whether a philosopher pursues
those ends which they think true in the Cynic dress and
manner of life or in some other. And, lastly, in regard to
the three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the
composite, they declare in favour of the third. That these
were the opinions and doctrines of the Old Academy, Varro
asserts on the authority of Antiochus, Cicero's master and his
own, though Cicero makes him out to have been more frequently
in accordance with the Stoics than with the Old Academy.
But of what importance is this to us, who ought to judge the
matter on its own merits, rather than to understand accurately
what different men have thought about it?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>4. <i>What the Christians believe regarding the supreme good and evil, in opposition
to the philosophers, who have maintained that the supreme good is in
themselves.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If, then, we be asked what the city of God has to say
upon these points, and, in the first place, what its opinion
regarding the supreme good and evil is, it will reply that life
eternal is the supreme good, death eternal the supreme evil,
and that to obtain the one and escape the other we must live
rightly. And thus it is written, "The just lives by faith,"<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
we do not as yet see our good, and must therefore live by
faith; neither have we in ourselves power to live rightly, but
can do so only if He who has given us faith to believe in His
help do help us when we believe and pray. As for those who
have supposed that the sovereign good and evil are to be
found in this life, and have placed it either in the soul or the
body, or in both, or, to speak more explicitly, either in pleasure
or in virtue, or in both; in repose or in virtue, or in
both; in pleasure and repose, or in virtue, or in all combined;
in the primary objects of nature, or in virtue, or in both,&mdash;all
these have, with a marvellous shallowness, sought to find their
blessedness in this life and in themselves. Contempt has
been poured upon such ideas by the Truth, saying by the prophet,
"The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men" (or, as the
Apostle Paul cites the passage, "The Lord knoweth the
thoughts of the <i>wise</i>") "that they are vain."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>For what flood of eloquence can suffice to detail the miseries
of this life? Cicero, in the <i>Consolation</i> on the death of his
daughter, has spent all his ability in lamentation; but how
inadequate was even his ability here? For when, where,
how, in this life can these primary objects of nature be possessed
so that they may not be assailed by unforeseen accidents?
Is the body of the wise man exempt from any pain
which may dispel pleasure, from any disquietude which may
banish repose? The amputation or decay of the members of
the body puts an end to its integrity, deformity blights its
beauty, weakness its health, lassitude its vigour, sleepiness or
sluggishness its activity,&mdash;and which of these is it that may
not assail the flesh of the wise man? Comely and fitting attitudes
and movements of the body are numbered among the
prime natural blessings; but what if some sickness makes the
members tremble? what if a man suffers from curvature of
the spine to such an extent that his hands reach the ground,
and he goes upon all-fours like a quadruped? Does not this
destroy all beauty and grace in the body, whether at rest or in
motion? What shall I say of the fundamental blessings of
the soul, sense and intellect, of which the one is given for the
perception, and the other for the comprehension of truth?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
But what kind of sense is it that remains when a man becomes
deaf and blind? where are reason and intellect when
disease makes a man delirious? We can scarcely, or not at
all, refrain from tears, when we think of or see the actions and
words of such frantic persons, and consider how different from
and even opposed to their own sober judgment and ordinary
conduct their present demeanour is. And what shall I say of
those who suffer from demoniacal possession? Where is their
own intelligence hidden and buried while the malignant spirit
is using their body and soul according to his own will? And
who is quite sure that no such thing can happen to the wise
man in this life? Then, as to the perception of truth, what
can we hope for even in this way while in the body, as we read
in the true book of Wisdom, "The corruptible body weigheth
down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle presseth down the
mind that museth upon many things?"<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> And eagerness,
or desire of action, if this is the right meaning to put upon
the Greek &#8001;&#961;&#956;&#8053;, is also reckoned among the primary advantages
of nature; and yet is it not this which produces those
pitiable movements of the insane, and those actions which we
shudder to see, when sense is deceived and reason deranged?</p>

<p>In fine, virtue itself, which is not among the primary objects
of nature, but succeeds to them as the result of learning, though
it holds the highest place among human good things, what is
its occupation save to wage perpetual war with vices,&mdash;not
those that are outside of us, but within; not other men's, but
our own,&mdash;a war which is waged especially by that virtue
which the Greeks call &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;, and we temperance,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> and
which bridles carnal lusts, and prevents them from winning
the consent of the spirit to wicked deeds? For we must not
fancy that there is no vice in us, when, as the apostle says,
"The flesh lusteth against the spirit;"<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> for to this vice there is
a contrary virtue, when, as the same writer says, "The spirit
lusteth against the flesh." "For these two," he says, "are contrary
one to the other, so that you cannot do the things which
you would." But what is it we wish to do when we seek to
attain the supreme good, unless that the flesh should cease
to lust against the spirit, and that there be no vice in us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
against which the spirit may lust? And as we cannot attain
to this in the present life, however ardently we desire it,
let us by God's help accomplish at least this, to preserve the
soul from succumbing and yielding to the flesh that lusts
against it, and to refuse our consent to the perpetration of
sin. Far be it from us, then, to fancy that while we are still
engaged in this intestine war, we have already found the
happiness which we seek to reach by victory. And who is
there so wise that he has no conflict at all to maintain against
his vices?</p>

<p>What shall I say of that virtue which is called prudence?
Is not all its vigilance spent in the discernment of good from
evil things, so that no mistake may be admitted about what
we should desire and what avoid? And thus it is itself a
proof that we are in the midst of evils, or that evils are in us;
for it teaches us that it is an evil to consent to sin, and a
good to refuse this consent. And yet this evil, to which prudence
teaches and temperance enables us not to consent, is
removed from this life neither by prudence nor by temperance.
And justice, whose office it is to render to every man
his due, whereby there is in man himself a certain just order
of nature, so that the soul is subjected to God, and the flesh
to the soul, and consequently both soul and flesh to God,&mdash;does
not this virtue demonstrate that it is as yet rather labouring
towards its end than resting in its finished work? For
the soul is so much the less subjected to God as it is less
occupied with the thought of God; and the flesh is so much the
less subjected to the spirit as it lusts more vehemently against
the spirit. So long, therefore, as we are beset by this weakness,
this plague, this disease, how shall we dare to say that we are
safe? and if not safe, then how can we be already enjoying
our final beatitude? Then that virtue which goes by the
name of fortitude is the plainest proof of the ills of life, for
it is these ills which it is compelled to bear patiently. And
this holds good, no matter though the ripest wisdom co-exists
with it. And I am at a loss to understand how the Stoic
philosophers can presume to say that these are no ills, though
at the same time they allow the wise man to commit suicide
and pass out of this life if they become so grievous that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
cannot or ought not to endure them. But such is the stupid
pride of these men who fancy that the supreme good can be
found in this life, and that they can become happy by their
own resources, that their wise man, or at least the man whom
they fancifully depict as such, is always happy, even though
he become blind, deaf, dumb, mutilated, racked with pains,
or suffer any conceivable calamity such as may compel him to
make away with himself; and they are not ashamed to call
the life that is beset with these evils happy. O happy life,
which seeks the aid of death to end it! If it is happy, let the
wise man remain in it; but if these ills drive him out of
it, in what sense is it happy? Or how can they say that
these are not evils which conquer the virtue of fortitude, and
force it not only to yield, but so to rave that it in one
breath calls life happy and recommends it to be given up?
For who is so blind as not to see that if it were happy it
would not be fled from? And if they say we should flee
from it on account of the infirmities that beset it, why then
do they not lower their pride and acknowledge that it is
miserable? Was it, I would ask, fortitude or weakness which
prompted Cato to kill himself? for he would not have done
so had he not been too weak to endure Cæsar's victory.
Where, then, is his fortitude? It has yielded, it has succumbed,
it has been so thoroughly overcome as to abandon,
forsake, flee this happy life. Or was it no longer happy?
Then it was miserable. How, then, were these not evils
which made life miserable, and a thing to be escaped from?</p>

<p>And therefore those who admit that these are evils, as the
Peripatetics do, and the Old Academy, the sect which Varro
advocates, express a more intelligible doctrine; but theirs
also is a surprising mistake, for they contend that this is a
happy life which is beset by these evils, even though they be
so great that he who endures them should commit suicide to
escape them. "Pains and anguish of body," says Varro, "are
evils, and so much the worse in proportion to their severity;
and to escape them you must quit this life." What life, I
pray? This life, he says, which is oppressed by such evils.
Then it is happy in the midst of these very evils on account
of which you say we must quit it? Or do you call it happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
because you are at liberty to escape these evils by death?
What, then, if by some secret judgment of God you were
held fast and not permitted to die, nor suffered to live without
these evils? In that case, at least, you would say that
such a life was miserable. It is soon relinquished, no doubt,
but this does not make it not miserable; for were it eternal,
you yourself would pronounce it miserable. Its brevity,
therefore, does not clear it of misery; neither ought it to be
called happiness because it is a brief misery. Certainly there
is a mighty force in these evils which compel a man&mdash;according
to them, even a wise man&mdash;to cease to be a man that he
may escape them, though they say, and say truly, that it is
as it were the first and strongest demand of nature that a
man cherish himself, and naturally therefore avoid death, and
should so stand his own friend as to wish and vehemently
aim at continuing to exist as a living creature, and subsisting
in this union of soul and body. There is a mighty force in
these evils to overcome this natural instinct by which death
is by every means and with all a man's efforts avoided, and
to overcome it so completely that what was avoided is desired,
sought after, and if it cannot in any other way be obtained,
is inflicted by the man on himself. There is a mighty force
in these evils which make fortitude a homicide,&mdash;if, indeed,
that is to be called fortitude which is so thoroughly overcome
by these evils, that it not only cannot preserve by patience
the man whom it undertook to govern and defend, but is
itself obliged to kill him. The wise man, I admit, ought to
bear death with patience, but when it is inflicted by another.
If, then, as these men maintain, he is obliged to inflict it on
himself, certainly it must be owned that the ills which compel
him to this are not only evils, but intolerable evils. The
life, then, which is either subject to accidents, or environed
with evils so considerable and grievous, could never have been
called happy, if the men who give it this name had condescended
to yield to the truth, and to be conquered by valid
arguments, when they inquired after the happy life, as they
yield to unhappiness, and are overcome by overwhelming
evils, when they put themselves to death, and if they had not
fancied that the supreme good was to be found in this mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
life; for the very virtues of this life, which are certainly its
best and most useful possessions, are all the more telling
proofs of its miseries in proportion as they are helpful against
the violence of its dangers, toils, and woes. For if these are
true virtues,&mdash;and such cannot exist save in those who have
true piety,&mdash;they do not profess to be able to deliver the men
who possess them from all miseries; for true virtues tell no
such lies, but they profess that by the hope of the future
world this life, which is miserably involved in the many and
great evils of this world, is happy as it is also safe. For if
not yet safe, how could it be happy? And therefore the
Apostle Paul, speaking not of men without prudence, temperance,
fortitude, and justice, but of those whose lives were
regulated by true piety, and whose virtues were therefore true,
says, "For we are saved by hope: now hope which is seen
is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
wait for it."<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> As, therefore, we are saved, so we are made
happy by hope. And as we do not as yet possess a present,
but look for a future salvation, so is it with our happiness,
and this "with patience;" for we are encompassed with evils,
which we ought patiently to endure, until we come to the
ineffable enjoyment of unmixed good; for there shall be no
longer anything to endure. Salvation, such as it shall be in
the world to come, shall itself be our final happiness. And
this happiness these philosophers refuse to believe in, because
they do not see it, and attempt to fabricate for themselves a
happiness in this life, based upon a virtue which is as deceitful
as it is proud.</p>

many distresses.</i></p>

<p>We give a much more unlimited approval to their idea that

than the nineteenth book of this work) either take a beginning

honourable friendships? On all hands we experience these
slights, suspicions, quarrels, war, all of which are undoubted
evils; while, on the other hand, peace is a doubtful good, because
we do not know the heart of our friend, and though
we did know it to-day, we should be as ignorant of what it
might be to-morrow. Who ought to be, or who are more
friendly than those who live in the same family? And yet
who can rely even upon this friendship, seeing that secret
treachery has often broken it up, and produced enmity as bitter
as the amity was sweet, or seemed sweet by the most perfect
dissimulation? It is on this account that the words of Cicero
so move the heart of every one, and provoke a sigh: "There
are no snares more dangerous than those which lurk under
the guise of duty or the name of relationship. For the man
who is your declared foe you can easily baffle by precaution;
but this hidden, intestine, and domestic danger not merely
exists, but overwhelms you before you can foresee and examine
it."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> It is also to this that allusion is made by the divine
saying, "A man's foes are those of his own household,"<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>&mdash;words
which one cannot hear without pain; for though a man have
sufficient fortitude to endure it with equanimity, and sufficient
sagacity to baffle the malice of a pretended friend, yet if he
himself is a good man, he cannot but be greatly pained at the
discovery of the perfidy of wicked men, whether they have
always been wicked and merely feigned goodness, or have
fallen from a better to a malicious disposition. If, then, home,
the natural refuge from the ills of life, is itself not safe, what
shall we say of the city, which, as it is larger, is so much the
more filled with lawsuits civil and criminal, and is never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
free from the fear, if sometimes from the actual outbreak, of
disturbing and bloody insurrections and civil wars?</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap6"></a>6. <i>Of the error of human judgments when the truth is hidden.</i></p>

<p>What shall I say of these judgments which men pronounce
on men, and which are necessary in communities, whatever
outward peace they enjoy? Melancholy and lamentable
judgments they are, since the judges are men who cannot
discern the consciences of those at their bar, and are therefore
frequently compelled to put innocent witnesses to the torture
to ascertain the truth regarding the crimes of other men.
What shall I say of torture applied to the accused himself?
He is tortured to discover whether he is guilty, so that, though
innocent, he suffers most undoubted punishment for crime that
is still doubtful, not because it is proved that he committed it,
but because it is not ascertained that he did not commit it.
Thus the ignorance of the judge frequently involves an innocent
person in suffering. And what is still more unendurable&mdash;a
thing, indeed, to be bewailed, and, if that were possible, watered
with fountains of tears&mdash;is this, that when the judge puts the
accused to the question, that he may not unwittingly put an
innocent man to death, the result of this lamentable ignorance
is that this very person, whom he tortured that he might not
condemn him if innocent, is condemned to death both tortured
and innocent. For if he has chosen, in obedience to the
philosophical instructions to the wise man, to quit this life
rather than endure any longer such tortures, he declares that
he has committed the crime which in fact he has not committed.
And when he has been condemned and put to
death, the judge is still in ignorance whether he has put to
death an innocent or a guilty person, though he put the
accused to the torture for the very purpose of saving himself
from condemning the innocent; and consequently he has
both tortured an innocent man to discover his innocence, and
has put him to death without discovering it. If such darkness
shrouds social life, will a wise judge take his seat on
the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For human
society, which he thinks it a wickedness to abandon, constrains
him and compels him to this duty. And he thinks it no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
wickedness that innocent witnesses are tortured regarding the
crimes of which other men are accused; or that the accused
are put to the torture, so that they are often overcome with
anguish, and, though innocent, make false confessions regarding
themselves, and are punished; or that, though they be not
condemned to die, they often die during, or in consequence of,
the torture; or that sometimes the accusers, who perhaps
have been prompted by a desire to benefit society by bringing
criminals to justice, are themselves condemned through the
ignorance of the judge, because they are unable to prove the
truth of their accusations though they are true, and because
the witnesses lie, and the accused endures the torture without
being moved to confession. These numerous and important
evils he does not consider sins; for the wise judge does these
things, not with any intention of doing harm, but because his
ignorance compels him, and because human society claims
him as a judge. But though we therefore acquit the judge
of malice, we must none the less condemn human life as
miserable. And if he is compelled to torture and punish the
innocent because his office and his ignorance constrain him, is
he a happy as well as a guiltless man? Surely it were proof
of more profound considerateness and finer feeling were he to
recognise the misery of these necessities, and shrink from his
own implication in that misery; and had he any piety about
him, he would cry to God, "From my necessities deliver Thou
me."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the diversity of languages, by which the intercourse of men is prevented;
and of the misery of wars, even of those called just.</i></p>

<p>After the state or city comes the world, the third circle of
human society,&mdash;the first being the house, and the second the
city. And the world, as it is larger, so it is fuller of dangers,
as the greater sea is the more dangerous. And here, in the
first place, man is separated from man by the difference of
languages. For if two men, each ignorant of the other's
language, meet, and are not compelled to pass, but, on the
contrary, to remain in company, dumb animals, though of
different species, would more easily hold intercourse than
they, human beings though they be. For their common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
nature is no help to friendliness when they are prevented by
diversity of language from conveying their sentiments to one
another; so that a man would more readily hold intercourse
with his dog than with a foreigner. But the imperial city
has endeavoured to impose on subject nations not only her
yoke, but her language, as a bond of peace, so that interpreters,
far from being scarce, are numberless. This is true;
but how many great wars, how much slaughter and bloodshed,
have provided this unity! And though these are past, the
end of these miseries has not yet come. For though there
have never been wanting, nor are yet wanting, hostile nations
beyond the empire, against whom wars have been and are
waged, yet, supposing there were no such nations, the very
extent of the empire itself has produced wars of a more obnoxious
description&mdash;social and civil wars&mdash;and with these
the whole race has been agitated, either by the actual conflict
or the fear of a renewed outbreak. If I attempted to give an
adequate description of these manifold disasters, these stern
and lasting necessities, though I am quite unequal to the
task, what limit could I set? But, say they, the wise man
will wage just wars. As if he would not all the rather
lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is
a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them,
and would therefore be delivered from all wars. For it is the
wrong-doing of the opposing party which compels the wise
man to wage just wars; and this wrong-doing, even though it
gave rise to no war, would still be matter of grief to man because
it is man's wrong-doing. Let every one, then, who
thinks with pain on all these great evils, so horrible, so ruthless,
acknowledge that this is misery. And if any one either
endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more
miserable plight still, for he thinks himself happy because he
has lost human feeling.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>That the friendship of good men cannot be securely rested in, so long as the
dangers of this life force us to be anxious.</i></p>

<p>In our present wretched condition we frequently mistake a
friend for an enemy, and an enemy for a friend. And if we
escape this pitiable blindness, is not the unfeigned confidence
and mutual love of true and good friends our one solace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
human society, filled as it is with misunderstandings and
calamities? And yet the more friends we have, and the more
widely they are scattered, the more numerous are our fears
that some portion of the vast masses of the disasters of life
may light upon them. For we are not only anxious lest they
suffer from famine, war, disease, captivity, or the inconceivable
horrors of slavery, but we are also affected with the
much more painful dread that their friendship may be
changed into perfidy, malice, and injustice. And when these
contingencies actually occur,&mdash;as they do the more frequently
the more friends we have, and the more widely they are
scattered,&mdash;and when they come to our knowledge, who but
the man who has experienced it can tell with what pangs the
heart is torn? We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they
were dead, although we could not without anguish hear of
even this. For if their life has solaced us with the charms of
friendship, can it be that their death should affect us with no
sadness? He who will have none of this sadness must, if
possible, have no friendly intercourse. Let him interdict or
extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless insensibility
the bonds of every human relationship; or let him
contrive so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into his
spirit. But if this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive
to feel no bitterness in the death of those whose life has
been sweet to us? Hence arises that grief which affects the
tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and which is healed by
the application of kindly consolation. For though the cure
is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better condition
the soul is in, we must not on this account suppose that there
is nothing at all to heal. Although, then, our present life is
afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more painful
degree, by the death of those very dear to us, and especially
of useful public men, yet we would prefer to hear that such
men were dead rather than to hear or perceive that they had
fallen from the faith, or from virtue,&mdash;in other words, that
they were spiritually dead. Of this vast material for misery
the earth is full, and therefore it is written, "Is not human
life upon earth a trial?"<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> And with the same reference the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Lord says, "Woe to the world because of offences!"<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> and
again, "Because iniquity abounded, the love of many shall
wax cold."<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> And hence we enjoy some gratification when
our good friends die; for though their death leaves us in
sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are
beyond the ills by which in this life even the best of men are
broken down or corrupted, or are in danger of both results.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>9. <i>Of the friendship of the holy angels, which men cannot be sure of in this life,
owing to the deceit of the demons who hold in bondage the worshippers of
a plurality of gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The philosophers who wished us to have the gods for our
friends rank the friendship of the holy angels in the fourth
circle of society, advancing now from the three circles of
society on earth to the universe, and embracing heaven itself.
And in this friendship we have indeed no fear that the angels
will grieve us by their death or deterioration. But as we
cannot mingle with them as familiarly as with men (which
itself is one of the grievances of this life), and as Satan, as
we read,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light,
to tempt those whom it is necessary to discipline, or just to
deceive, there is great need of God's mercy to preserve us
from making friends of demons in disguise, while we fancy
we have good angels for our friends; for the astuteness and
deceitfulness of these wicked spirits is equalled by their hurtfulness.
And is this not a great misery of human life, that
we are involved in such ignorance as, but for God's mercy,
makes us a prey to these demons? And it is very certain
that the philosophers of the godless city, who have maintained
that the gods were their friends, had fallen a prey to
the malignant demons who rule that city, and whose eternal
punishment is to be shared by it. For the nature of these
beings is sufficiently evinced by the sacred or rather sacrilegious
observances which form their worship, and by the
filthy games in which their crimes are celebrated, and which
they themselves originated and exacted from their worshippers
as a fit propitiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">10. <i>The reward prepared for the saints after they have endured the
trial of this life.</i></p>

<p>But not even the saints and faithful worshippers of the
one true and most high God are safe from the manifold temptations
and deceits of the demons. For in this abode of
weakness, and in these wicked days, this state of anxiety has
also its use, stimulating us to seek with keener longing for
that security where peace is complete and unassailable. There
we shall enjoy the gifts of nature, that is to say, all that God
the Creator of all natures has bestowed upon ours,&mdash;gifts not
only good, but eternal,&mdash;not only of the spirit, healed now by
wisdom, but also of the body renewed by the resurrection.
There the virtues shall no longer be struggling against any
vice or evil, but shall enjoy the reward of victory, the eternal
peace which no adversary shall disturb. This is the final
blessedness, this the ultimate consummation, the unending end.
Here, indeed, we are said to be blessed when we have such
peace as can be enjoyed in a good life; but such blessedness
is mere misery compared to that final felicity. When we
mortals possess such peace as this mortal life can afford,
virtue, if we are living rightly, makes a right use of the advantages
of this peaceful condition; and when we have it not,
virtue makes a good use even of the evils a man suffers.
But this is true virtue, when it refers all the advantages it
makes a good use of, and all that it does in making good use
of good and evil things, and itself also, to that end in which
we shall enjoy the best and greatest peace possible.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the happiness of the eternal peace, which constitutes the end or true
perfection of the saints.</i></p>

<p>And thus we may say of peace, as we have said of eternal
life, that it is the end of our good; and the rather because
the Psalmist says of the city of God, the subject of this laborious
work, "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God,
O Zion: for He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He
hath blessed thy children within thee; who hath made thy
borders peace."<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> For when the bars of her gates shall be
strengthened, none shall go in or come out from her; consequently
we ought to understand the peace of her borders as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that final peace we are wishing to declare. For even the
mystical name of the city itself, that is, <i>Jerusalem</i>, means, as I
have already said, "Vision of Peace." But as the word peace is
employed in connection with things in this world in which
certainly life eternal has no place, we have preferred to call
the end or supreme good of this city life eternal rather than
peace. Of this end the apostle says, "But now, being freed
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
holiness, and the end life eternal."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> But, on the other hand,
as those who are not familiar with Scripture may suppose that
the life of the wicked is eternal life, either because of the
immortality of the soul, which some of the philosophers even
have recognised, or because of the endless punishment of the
wicked, which forms a part of our faith, and which seems
impossible unless the wicked live for ever, it may therefore
be advisable, in order that every one may readily understand
what we mean, to say that the end or supreme good of this
city is either peace in eternal life, or eternal life in peace. For
peace is a good so great, that even in this earthly and mortal
life there is no word we hear with such pleasure, nothing we
desire with such zest, or find to be more thoroughly gratifying.
So that if we dwell for a little longer on this subject,
we shall not, in my opinion, be wearisome to our readers, who
will attend both for the sake of understanding what is the
end of this city of which we speak, and for the sake of the
sweetness of peace which is dear to all.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>That even the fierceness of war and all the disquietude of men make
towards this one end of peace, which every nature desires.</i></p>

<p>Whoever gives even moderate attention to human affairs
and to our common nature, will recognise that if there is
no man who does not wish to be joyful, neither is there
any one who does not wish to have peace. For even they
who make war desire nothing but victory,&mdash;desire, that is
to say, to attain to peace with glory. For what else is victory
than the conquest of those who resist us? and when this is
done there is peace. It is therefore with the desire for peace
that wars are waged, even by those who take pleasure in
exercising their warlike nature in command and battle. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
hence it is obvious that peace is the end sought for by war.
For every man seeks peace by waging war, but no man seeks
war by making peace. For even they who intentionally
interrupt the peace in which they are living have no hatred
of peace, but only wish it changed into a peace that suits
them better. They do not, therefore, wish to have no peace,
but only one more to their mind. And in the case of sedition,
when men have separated themselves from the community,
they yet do not effect what they wish, unless they maintain
some kind of peace with their fellow-conspirators. And
therefore even robbers take care to maintain peace with their
comrades, that they may with greater effect and greater safety
invade the peace of other men. And if an individual happen
to be of such unrivalled strength, and to be so jealous of partnership,
that he trusts himself with no comrades, but makes
his own plots, and commits depredations and murders on his
own account, yet he maintains some shadow of peace with
such persons as he is unable to kill, and from whom he
wishes to conceal his deeds. In his own home, too, he makes
it his aim to be at peace with his wife and children, and any
other members of his household; for unquestionably their
prompt obedience to his every look is a source of pleasure to
him. And if this be not rendered, he is angry, he chides and
punishes; and even by this storm he secures the calm peace
of his own home, as occasion demands. For he sees that
peace cannot be maintained unless all the members of the
same domestic circle be subject to one head, such as he himself
is in his own house. And therefore if a city or nation
offered to submit itself to him, to serve him in the same style
as he had made his household serve him, he would no longer
lurk in a brigand's hiding-places, but lift his head in open
day as a king, though the same covetousness and wickedness
should remain in him. And thus all men desire to have
peace with their own circle whom they wish to govern as
suits themselves. For even those whom they make war
against they wish to make their own, and impose on them
the laws of their own peace.</p>

<p>But let us suppose a man such as poetry and mythology
speak of,&mdash;a man so insociable and savage as to be called rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
a semi-man than a man.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Although, then, his kingdom was
the solitude of a dreary cave, and he himself was so singularly
bad-hearted that he was named &#922;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#962;, which is the Greek
word for <i>bad</i>; though he had no wife to soothe him with endearing
talk, no children to play with, no sons to do his bidding, no
friend to enliven him with intercourse, not even his father
Vulcan (though in one respect he was happier than his father,
not having begotten a monster like himself); although he gave
to no man, but took as he wished whatever he could, from
whomsoever he could, when he could; yet in that solitary den,
the floor of which, as Virgil<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> says, was always reeking with
recent slaughter, there was nothing else than peace sought, a
peace in which no one should molest him, or disquiet him with
any assault or alarm. With his own body he desired to be at
peace; and he was satisfied only in proportion as he had this
peace. For he ruled his members, and they obeyed him; and
for the sake of pacifying his mortal nature, which rebelled when
it needed anything, and of allaying the sedition of hunger which
threatened to banish the soul from the body, he made forays,
slew, and devoured, but used the ferocity and savageness he
displayed in these actions only for the preservation of his own
life's peace. So that, had he been willing to make with other
men the same peace which he made with himself in his own
cave, he would neither have been called bad, nor a monster,
nor a semi-man. Or if the appearance of his body and his
vomiting smoky fires frightened men from having any dealings
with him, perhaps his fierce ways arose not from a desire to
do mischief, but from the necessity of finding a living. But he
may have had no existence, or, at least, he was not such as the
poets fancifully describe him, for they had to exalt Hercules,
and did so at the expense of Cacus. It is better, then, to
believe that such a man or semi-man never existed, and that
this, in common with many other fancies of the poets, is mere
fiction. For the most savage animals (and he is said to have
been almost a wild beast) encompass their own species with a
ring of protecting peace. They cohabit, beget, produce, suckle,
and bring up their young, though very many of them are not
gregarious, but solitary,&mdash;not like sheep, deer, pigeons, starlings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
bees, but such as lions, foxes, eagles, bats. For what tigress
does not gently purr over her cubs, and lay aside her ferocity
to fondle them? What kite, solitary as he is when circling
over his prey, does not seek a mate, build a nest, hatch the
eggs, bring up the young birds, and maintain with the mother
of his family as peaceful a domestic alliance as he can? How
much more powerfully do the laws of man's nature move him
to hold fellowship and maintain peace with all men so far as
in him lies, since even wicked men wage war to maintain the
peace of their own circle, and wish that, if possible, all men
belonged to them, that all men and things might serve but one
head, and might, either through love or fear, yield themselves
to peace with him! It is thus that pride in its perversity apes
God. It abhors equality with other men under Him; but,
instead of His rule, it seeks to impose a rule of its own upon
its equals. It abhors, that is to say, the just peace of God,
and loves its own unjust peace; but it cannot help loving peace
of one kind or other. For there is no vice so clean contrary
to nature that it obliterates even the faintest traces of nature.</p>

<p>He, then, who prefers what is right to what is wrong, and
what is well-ordered to what is perverted, sees that the peace
of unjust men is not worthy to be called peace in comparison
with the peace of the just. And yet even what is perverted
must of necessity be in harmony with, and in dependence on,
and in some part of the order of things, for otherwise it would
have no existence at all. Suppose a man hangs with his head
downwards, this is certainly a perverted attitude of body and
arrangement of its members; for that which nature requires
to be above is beneath, and <i>vice versâ</i>. This perversity disturbs
the peace of the body, and is therefore painful. Nevertheless
the spirit is at peace with its body, and labours for its preservation,
and hence the suffering; but if it is banished from the
body by its pains, then, so long as the bodily framework holds
together, there is in the remains a kind of peace among the
members, and hence the body remains suspended. And inasmuch
as the earthy body tends towards the earth, and rests on
the bond by which it is suspended, it tends thus to its natural
peace, and the voice of its own weight demands a place for it
to rest; and though now lifeless and without feeling, it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
not fall from the peace that is natural to its place in creation,
whether it already has it, or is tending towards it. For if you
apply embalming preparations to prevent the bodily frame from
mouldering and dissolving, a kind of peace still unites part to
part, and keeps the whole body in a suitable place on the earth,&mdash;in
other words, in a place that is at peace with the body. If,
on the other hand, the body receive no such care, but be left
to the natural course, it is disturbed by exhalations that do not
harmonize with one another, and that offend our senses; for
it is this which is perceived in putrefaction until it is assimilated
to the elements of the world, and particle by particle
enters into peace with them. Yet throughout this process the
laws of the most high Creator and Governor are strictly observed,
for it is by Him the peace of the universe is administered. For
although minute animals are produced from the carcase of a
larger animal, all these little atoms, by the law of the same
Creator, serve the animals they belong to in peace. And although
the flesh of dead animals be eaten by others, no matter where
it be carried, nor what it be brought into contact with, nor what
it be converted and changed into, it still is ruled by the same
laws which pervade all things for the conservation of every
mortal race, and which bring things that fit one another into
harmony.</p>

<p>13. <i>Of the universal peace which the law of nature preserves through all disturbances,
and by which every one reaches his desert in a way regulated by
the just Judge.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The peace of the body then consists in the duly proportioned
arrangement of its parts. The peace of the irrational soul is
the harmonious repose of the appetites, and that of the rational
soul the harmony of knowledge and action. The peace of body
and soul is the well-ordered and harmonious life and health of
the living creature. Peace between man and God is the well-ordered
obedience of faith to eternal law. Peace between man
and man is well-ordered concord. Domestic peace is the well-ordered
concord between those of the family who rule and
those who obey. Civil peace is a similar concord among the
citizens. The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered
and harmonious enjoyment of God, and of one another in God.
The peace of all things is the tranquillity of order. Order is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the distribution which allots things equal and unequal, each to
its own place. And hence, though the miserable, in so far as
they are such, do certainly not enjoy peace, but are severed
from that tranquillity of order in which there is no disturbance,
nevertheless, inasmuch as they are deservedly and justly miserable,
they are by their very misery connected with order.
They are not, indeed, conjoined with the blessed, but they are
disjoined from them by the law of order. And though they
are disquieted, their circumstances are notwithstanding adjusted
to them, and consequently they have some tranquillity of order,
and therefore some peace. But they are wretched because,
although not wholly miserable, they are not in that place where
any mixture of misery is impossible. They would, however,
be more wretched if they had not that peace which arises from
being in harmony with the natural order of things. When
they suffer, their peace is in so far disturbed; but their peace
continues in so far as they do not suffer, and in so far as their
nature continues to exist. As, then, there may be life without
pain, while there cannot be pain without some kind of life,
so there may be peace without war, but there cannot be war
without some kind of peace, because war supposes the existence
of some natures to wage it, and these natures cannot
exist without peace of one kind or other.</p>

<p>And therefore there is a nature in which evil does not or
even cannot exist; but there cannot be a nature in which
there is no good. Hence not even the nature of the devil
himself is evil, in so far as it is nature, but it was made evil
by being perverted. Thus he did not abide in the truth,<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> but
could not escape the judgment of the Truth; he did not abide
in the tranquillity of order, but did not therefore escape the
power of the Ordainer. The good imparted by God to his
nature did not screen him from the justice of God by which
order was preserved in his punishment; neither did God
punish the good which He had created, but the evil which
the devil had committed. God did not take back all He had
imparted to his nature, but something He took and something
He left, that there might remain enough to be sensible of the
loss of what was taken. And this very sensibility to pain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
evidence of the good which has been taken away and the
good which has been left. For, were nothing good left, there
could be no pain on account of the good which had been lost.
For he who sins is still worse if he rejoices in his loss of
righteousness. But he who is in pain, if he derives no benefit
from it, mourns at least the loss of health. And as righteousness
and health are both good things, and as the loss of any
good thing is matter of grief, not of joy,&mdash;if, at least, there is
no compensation, as spiritual righteousness may compensate
for the loss of bodily health,&mdash;certainly it is more suitable
for a wicked man to grieve in punishment than to rejoice in
his fault. As, then, the joy of a sinner who has abandoned
what is good is evidence of a bad will, so his grief for the
good he has lost when he is punished is evidence of a good
nature. For he who laments the peace his nature has lost is
stirred to do so by some relics of peace which make his nature
friendly to itself. And it is very just that in the final
punishment the wicked and godless should in anguish bewail
the loss of the natural advantages they enjoyed, and should
perceive that they were most justly taken from them by that
God whose benign liberality they had despised. God, then,
the most wise Creator and most just Ordainer of all natures,
who placed the human race upon earth as its greatest ornament,
imparted to men some good things adapted to this life,
to wit, temporal peace, such as we can enjoy in this life from
health and safety and human fellowship, and all things needful
for the preservation and recovery of this peace, such as
the objects which are accommodated to our outward senses,
light, night, the air, and waters suitable for us, and everything
the body requires to sustain, shelter, heal, or beautify
it: and all under this most equitable condition, that every
man who made a good use of these advantages suited to the
peace of this mortal condition, should receive ampler and
better blessings, namely, the peace of immortality, accompanied
by glory and honour in an endless life made fit for the enjoyment
of God and of one another in God; but that he who
used the present blessings badly should both lose them and
should not receive the others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">14. <i>Of the order and law which obtain in heaven and earth, whereby it comes to
pass that human society is served by those who rule it.</i></p>

<p>The whole use, then, of things temporal has a reference to
this result of earthly peace in the earthly community, while
in the city of God it is connected with eternal peace. And
therefore, if we were irrational animals, we should desire
nothing beyond the proper arrangement of the parts of the
body and the satisfaction of the appetites,&mdash;nothing, therefore,
but bodily comfort and abundance of pleasures, that the
peace of the body might contribute to the peace of the soul.
For if bodily peace be awanting, a bar is put to the peace
even of the irrational soul, since it cannot obtain the gratification
of its appetites. And these two together help out the
mutual peace of soul and body, the peace of harmonious life
and health. For as animals, by shunning pain, show that they
love bodily peace, and, by pursuing pleasure to gratify their
appetites, show that they love peace of soul, so their shrinking
from death is a sufficient indication of their intense love of
that peace which binds soul and body in close alliance. But,
as man has a rational soul, he subordinates all this which he
has in common with the beasts to the peace of his rational
soul, that his intellect may have free play and may regulate
his actions, and that he may thus enjoy the well-ordered harmony
of knowledge and action which constitutes, as we have
said, the peace of the rational soul. And for this purpose he
must desire to be neither molested by pain, nor disturbed by
desire, nor extinguished by death, that he may arrive at some
useful knowledge by which he may regulate his life and
manners. But, owing to the liability of the human mind to
fall into mistakes, this very pursuit of knowledge may be a
snare to him unless he has a divine Master, whom he may
obey without misgiving, and who may at the same time give
him such help as to preserve his own freedom. And because,
so long as he is in this mortal body, he is a stranger to God,
he walks by faith, not by sight; and he therefore refers all
peace, bodily or spiritual or both, to that peace which mortal
man has with the immortal God, so that he exhibits the well-ordered
obedience of faith to eternal law. But as this divine
Master inculcates two precepts,&mdash;the love of God and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
love of our neighbour,&mdash;and as in these precepts a man finds
three things he has to love,&mdash;God, himself, and his neighbour,&mdash;and
that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows
that he must endeavour to get his neighbour to love God,
since he is ordered to love his neighbour as himself. He
ought to make this endeavour in behalf of his wife, his children,
his household, all within his reach, even as he would
wish his neighbour to do the same for him if he needed it;
and consequently he will be at peace, or in well-ordered concord,
with all men, as far as in him lies. And this is the
order of this concord, that a man, in the first place, injure no
one, and, in the second, do good to every one he can reach.
Primarily, therefore, his own household are his care, for the
law of nature and of society gives him readier access to them
and greater opportunity of serving them. And hence the
apostle says, "Now, if any provide not for his own, and
specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the
faith, and is worse than an infidel."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> This is the origin of
domestic peace, or the well-ordered concord of those in the
family who rule and those who obey. For they who care
for the rest rule,&mdash;the husband the wife, the parents the
children, the masters the servants; and they who are cared
for obey,&mdash;the women their husbands, the children their
parents, the servants their masters. But in the family of
the just man who lives by faith and is as yet a pilgrim
journeying on to the celestial city, even those who rule
serve those whom they seem to command; for they rule
not from a love of power, but from a sense of the duty they
owe to others&mdash;not because they are proud of authority, but
because they love mercy.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>Of the liberty proper to man's nature, and the servitude introduced by sin,&mdash;a
servitude in which the man whose will is wicked is the slave of his own
lust, though he is free so far as regards other men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This is prescribed by the order of nature: it is thus that
God has created man. For "let them," He says, "have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over every creeping thing which creepeth on the
earth."<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> He did not intend that His rational creature, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
was made in His image, should have dominion over anything
but the irrational creation,&mdash;not man over man, but man over
the beasts. And hence the righteous men in primitive times
were made shepherds of cattle rather than kings of men, God
intending thus to teach us what the relative position of the
creatures is, and what the desert of sin; for it is with justice,
we believe, that the condition of slavery is the result of sin.
And this is why we do not find the word "slave" in any part
of Scripture until righteous Noah branded the sin of his son
with this name. It is a name, therefore, introduced by sin
and not by nature. The origin of the Latin word for slave
is supposed to be found in the circumstance that those who
by the law of war were liable to be killed were sometimes
preserved by their victors, and were hence called servants.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
And these circumstances could never have arisen save through
sin. For even when we wage a just war, our adversaries
must be sinning; and every victory, even though gained by
wicked men, is a result of the first judgment of God, who
humbles the vanquished either for the sake of removing or
of punishing their sins. Witness that man of God, Daniel,
who, when he was in captivity, confessed to God his own sins
and the sins of his people, and declares with pious grief that
these were the cause of the captivity.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> The prime cause, then,
of slavery is sin, which brings man under the dominion of his
fellow,&mdash;that which does not happen save by the judgment of
God, with whom is no unrighteousness, and who knows how
to award fit punishments to every variety of offence. But our
Master in heaven says, "Every one who doeth sin is the servant
of sin."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> And thus there are many wicked masters who
have religious men as their slaves, and who are yet themselves
in bondage; "for of whom a man is overcome, of the same
is he brought in bondage."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> And beyond question it is a
happier thing to be the slave of a man than of a lust; for even
this very lust of ruling, to mention no others, lays waste men's
hearts with the most ruthless dominion. Moreover, when men
are subjected to one another in a peaceful order, the lowly
position does as much good to the servant as the proud position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
does harm to the master. But by nature, as God first
created us, no one is the slave either of man or of sin. This
servitude is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law
which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids
its disturbance; for if nothing had been done in violation
of that law, there would have been nothing to restrain by
penal servitude. And therefore the apostle admonishes slaves
to be subject to their masters, and to serve them heartily
and with good-will, so that, if they cannot be freed by their
masters, they may themselves make their slavery in some sort
free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love, until
all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every
human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of equitable rule.</i></p>

<p>And therefore, although our righteous fathers<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> had slaves,
and administered their domestic affairs so as to distinguish
between the condition of slaves and the heirship of sons in
regard to the blessings of this life, yet in regard to the worship
of God, in whom we hope for eternal blessings, they took
an equally loving oversight of all the members of their household.
And this is so much in accordance with the natural
order, that the head of the household was called <i>paterfamilias</i>;
and this name has been so generally accepted, that even those
whose rule is unrighteous are glad to apply it to themselves.
But those who are true fathers of their households desire and
endeavour that all the members of their household, equally
with their own children, should worship and win God, and
should come to that heavenly home in which the duty of
ruling men is no longer necessary, because the duty of caring
for their everlasting happiness has also ceased; but, until they
reach that home, masters ought to feel their position of authority
a greater burden than servants their service. And if any
member of the family interrupts the domestic peace by disobedience,
he is corrected either by word or blow, or some
kind of just and legitimate punishment, such as society permits,
that he may himself be the better for it, and be readjusted
to the family harmony from which he had dislocated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
himself. For as it is not benevolent to give a man help at
the expense of some greater benefit he might receive, so it is
not innocent to spare a man at the risk of his falling into
graver sin. To be innocent, we must not only do harm to
no man, but also restrain him from sin or punish his sin, so
that either the man himself who is punished may profit by
his experience, or others be warned by his example. Since,
then, the house ought to be the beginning or element of the
city, and every beginning bears reference to some end of its
own kind, and every element to the integrity of the whole of
which it is an element, it follows plainly enough that domestic
peace has a relation to civic peace,&mdash;in other words, that the
well-ordered concord of domestic obedience and domestic rule
has a relation to the well-ordered concord of civic obedience
and civic rule. And therefore it follows, further, that the
father of the family ought to frame his domestic rule in accordance
with the law of the city, so that the household may
be in harmony with the civic order.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>What produces peace, and what discord, between the heavenly and
earthly cities.</i></p>

<p>But the families which do not live by faith seek their
peace in the earthly advantages of this life; while the families
which live by faith look for those eternal blessings which
are promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time
and of earth as do not fascinate and divert them from God,
but rather aid them to endure with greater ease, and to keep
down the number of those burdens of the corruptible body
which weigh upon the soul. Thus the things necessary for
this mortal life are used by both kinds of men and families
alike, but each has its own peculiar and widely different aim
in using them. The earthly city, which does not live by faith,
seeks an earthly peace, and the end it proposes, in the well-ordered
concord of civic obedience and rule, is the combination
of men's wills to attain the things which are helpful to
this life. The heavenly city, or rather the part of it which
sojourns on earth and lives by faith, makes use of this peace
only because it must, until this mortal condition which necessitates
it shall pass away. Consequently, so long as it lives
like a captive and a stranger in the earthly city, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
has already received the promise of redemption, and the gift
of the Spirit as the earnest of it, it makes no scruple to obey
the laws of the earthly city, whereby the things necessary for
the maintenance of this mortal life are administered; and
thus, as this life is common to both cities, so there is a harmony
between them in regard to what belongs to it. But, as
the earthly city has had some philosophers whose doctrine is
condemned by the divine teaching, and who, being deceived
either by their own conjectures or by demons, supposed that
many gods must be invited to take an interest in human
affairs, and assigned to each a separate function and a separate
department,&mdash;to one the body, to another the soul; and
in the body itself, to one the head, to another the neck, and
each of the other members to one of the gods; and in like
manner, in the soul, to one god the natural capacity was assigned,
to another education, to another anger, to another lust;
and so the various affairs of life were assigned,&mdash;cattle to one,
corn to another, wine to another, oil to another, the woods to
another, money to another, navigation to another, wars and
victories to another, marriages to another, births and fecundity
to another, and other things to other gods: and as the celestial
city, on the other hand, knew that one God only was to
be worshipped, and that to Him alone was due that service
which the Greeks call &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, and which can be given only
to a god, it has come to pass that the two cities could not
have common laws of religion, and that the heavenly city has
been compelled in this matter to dissent, and to become
obnoxious to those who think differently, and to stand the
brunt of their anger and hatred and persecutions, except in so
far as the minds of their enemies have been alarmed by the
multitude of the Christians and quelled by the manifest protection
of God accorded to them. This heavenly city, then,
while it sojourns on earth, calls citizens out of all nations, and
gathers together a society of pilgrims of all languages, not
scrupling about diversities in the manners, laws, and institutions
whereby earthly peace is secured and maintained, but
recognising that, however various these are, they all tend to
one and the same end of earthly peace. It therefore is so far
from rescinding and abolishing these diversities, that it even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
preserves and adopts them, so long only as no hindrance to
the worship of the one supreme and true God is thus introduced.
Even the heavenly city, therefore, while in its state
of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as
it can without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains
a common agreement among men regarding the acquisition
of the necessaries of life, and makes this earthly peace
bear upon the peace of heaven; for this alone can be truly
called and esteemed the peace of the reasonable creatures, consisting
as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment
of God and of one another in God. When we shall
have reached that peace, this mortal life shall give place
to one that is eternal, and our body shall be no more this
animal body which by its corruption weighs down the soul,
but a spiritual body feeling no want, and in all its members
subjected to the will. In its pilgrim state the heavenly
city possesses this peace by faith; and by this faith it lives
righteously when it refers to the attainment of that peace
every good action towards God and man; for the life of the
city is a social life.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>How different the uncertainty of the New Academy is from the certainty of
the Christian faith.</i></p>

<p>As regards the uncertainty about everything which Varro
alleges to be the differentiating characteristic of the New
Academy, the city of God thoroughly detests such doubt as
madness. Regarding matters which it apprehends by the
mind and reason it has most absolute certainty, although its
knowledge is limited because of the corruptible body pressing
down the mind, for, as the apostle says, "We know in part."<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
It believes also the evidence of the senses which the mind
uses by aid of the body; for [if one who trusts his senses is
sometimes deceived], he is more wretchedly deceived who
fancies he should never trust them. It believes also the
Holy Scriptures, old and new, which we call canonical, and
which are the source of the faith by which the just lives,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> and
by which we walk without doubting whilst we are absent
from the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> So long as this faith remains inviolate and
firm, we may without blame entertain doubts regarding some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
things which we have neither perceived by sense nor by
reason, and which have not been revealed to us by the
canonical Scriptures, nor come to our knowledge through
witnesses whom it is absurd to disbelieve.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the dress and habits of the Christian people.</i></p>

<p>It is a matter of no moment in the city of God whether
he who adopts the faith that brings men to God adopts it in
one dress and manner of life or another, so long only as he
lives in conformity with the commandments of God. And
hence, when philosophers themselves become Christians, they
are compelled, indeed, to abandon their erroneous doctrines, but
not their dress and mode of living, which are no obstacle to
religion. So that we make no account of that distinction of
sects which Varro adduced in connection with the Cynic
school, provided always nothing indecent or self-indulgent is
retained. As to these three modes of life, the contemplative,
the active, and the composite, although, so long as a man's
faith is preserved, he may choose any of them without detriment
to his eternal interests, yet he must never overlook the
claims of truth and duty. No man has a right to lead such
a life of contemplation as to forget in his own ease the service
due to his neighbour; nor has any man a right to be so immersed
in active life as to neglect the contemplation of God.
The charm of leisure must not be indolent vacancy of mind,
but the investigation or discovery of truth, that thus every
man may make solid attainments without grudging that others
do the same. And, in active life, it is not the honours or
power of this life we should covet, since all things under the
sun are vanity, but we should aim at using our position and
influence, if these have been honourably attained, for the welfare
of those who are under us, in the way we have already
explained.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> It is to this the apostle refers when he says,
"He that desireth the episcopate desireth a good work."<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> He
wished to show that the episcopate is the title of a work, not
of an honour. It is a Greek word, and signifies that he who
governs, superintends or takes care of those whom he governs:
for &#7952;&#960;&#8055; means <i>over</i>, and &#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, <i>to see</i>; therefore <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;
means "to oversee."<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> So that he who loves to govern rather
than to do good is no bishop. Accordingly no one is prohibited
from the search after truth, for in this leisure may
most laudably be spent; but it is unseemly to covet the high
position requisite for governing the people, even though that
position be held and that government be administered in a
seemly manner. And therefore holy leisure is longed for by
the love of truth; but it is the necessity of love to undertake
requisite business. If no one imposes this burden upon us,
we are free to sift and contemplate truth; but if it be laid
upon us, we are necessitated for love's sake to undertake it.
And yet not even in this case are we obliged wholly to relinquish
the sweets of contemplation; for were these to be
withdrawn, the burden might prove more than we could bear.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>That the saints are in this life blessed in hope.</i></p>

<p>Since, then, the supreme good of the city of God is perfect
and eternal peace, not such as mortals pass into and out of
by birth and death, but the peace of freedom from all evil, in
which the immortals ever abide, who can deny that that
future life is most blessed, or that, in comparison with it, this
life which now we live is most wretched, be it filled with all
blessings of body and soul and external things? And yet, if
any man uses this life with a reference to that other which
he ardently loves and confidently hopes for, he may well be
called even now blessed, though not in reality so much as in
hope. But the actual possession of the happiness of this
life, without the hope of what is beyond, is but a false happiness
and profound misery. For the true blessings of the soul
are not now enjoyed; for that is no true wisdom which does
not direct all its prudent observations, manly actions, virtuous
self-restraint, and just arrangements, to that end in which
God shall be all and all in a secure eternity and perfect
peace.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Whether there ever was a Roman republic answering to the definitions
of Scipio in Cicero's dialogue.</i></p>

<p>This, then, is the place where I should fulfil the promise I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
gave in the second book of this work,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and explain, as briefly

laid down by Scipio in Cicero's <i>De Republica</i>, there never was
a Roman republic; for he briefly defines a republic as the
weal of the people. And if this definition be true, there
never was a Roman republic, for the people's weal was never
attained among the Romans. For the people, according to
his definition, is an assemblage associated by a common
acknowledgment of right and by a community of interests.
And what he means by a common acknowledgment of right
he explains at large, showing that a republic cannot be administered
without justice. Where, therefore, there is no
true justice there can be no right. For that which is done
by right is justly done, and what is unjustly done cannot be
done by right. For the unjust inventions of men are neither
to be considered nor spoken of as rights; for even they themselves
say that right is that which flows from the fountain of
justice, and deny the definition which is commonly given by
those who misconceive the matter, that right is that which is
useful to the stronger party. Thus, where there is not true
justice there can be no assemblage of men associated by a
common acknowledgment of right, and therefore there can
be no people, as defined by Scipio or Cicero; and if no
people, then no weal of the people, but only of some promiscuous
multitude unworthy of the name of people. Consequently,
if the republic is the weal of the people, and there is
no people if it be not associated by a common acknowledgment
of right, and if there is no right where there is no justice,
then most certainly it follows that there is no republic where
there is no justice. Further, justice is that virtue which
gives every one his due. Where, then, is the justice of man,
when he deserts the true God and yields himself to impure
demons? Is this to give every one his due? Or is he who
keeps back a piece of ground from the purchaser, and gives it
to a man who has no right to it, unjust, while he who keeps
back himself from the God who made him, and serves wicked
spirits, is just?</p>

<p>This same book, <i>De Republica</i>, advocates the cause of justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
against injustice with great force and keenness. The pleading
for injustice against justice was first heard, and it was
asserted that without injustice a republic could neither increase
nor even subsist, for it was laid down as an absolutely
unassailable position that it is unjust for some men to rule
and some to serve; and yet the imperial city to which the
republic belongs cannot rule her provinces without having
recourse to this injustice. It was replied in behalf of justice,
that this ruling of the provinces is just, because servitude may
be advantageous to the provincials, and is so when rightly
administered,&mdash;that is to say, when lawless men are prevented
from doing harm. And further, as they became worse and
worse so long as they were free, they will improve by subjection.
To confirm this reasoning, there is added an eminent
example drawn from nature: for "why," it is asked, "does
God rule man, the soul the body, the reason the passions and
other vicious parts of the soul?" This example leaves no
doubt that, to some, servitude is useful; and, indeed, to serve
God is useful to all. And it is when the soul serves God
that it exercises a right control over the body; and in the
soul itself the reason must be subject to God if it is to govern
as it ought the passions and other vices. Hence, when a
man does not serve God, what justice can we ascribe to him,
since in this case his soul cannot exercise a just control over
the body, nor his reason over his vices? And if there is no
justice in such an individual, certainly there can be none in a
community composed of such persons. Here, therefore, there
is not that common acknowledgment of right which makes
an assemblage of men a people whose affairs we call a republic.
And why need I speak of the advantageousness, the
common participation in which, according to the definition,
makes a people? For although, if you choose to regard the
matter attentively, you will see that there is nothing advantageous
to those who live godlessly, as every one lives who
does not serve God but demons, whose wickedness you may
measure by their desire to receive the worship of men though
they are most impure spirits, yet what I have said of the
common acknowledgment of right is enough to demonstrate
that, according to the above definition, there can be no people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
and therefore no republic, where there is no justice. For if
they assert that in their republic the Romans did not serve
unclean spirits, but good and holy gods, must we therefore
again reply to this evasion, though already we have said
enough, and more than enough, to expose it? He must be
an uncommonly stupid, or a shamelessly contentious person,
who has read through the foregoing books to this point, and
can yet question whether the Romans served wicked and
impure demons. But, not to speak of their character, it is
written in the law of the true God, "He that sacrificeth unto
any god save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
He, therefore, who uttered so menacing a commandment
decreed that no worship should be given either to
good or bad gods.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Whether the God whom the Christians serve is the true God to whom alone
sacrifice ought to be paid.</i></p>

<p>But it may be replied, Who is this God, or what proof is
there that He alone is worthy to receive sacrifice from the
Romans? One must be very blind to be still asking who
this God is. He is the God whose prophets predicted the
things we see accomplished. He is the God from whom
Abraham received the assurance, "In thy seed shall all nations
be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> That this was fulfilled in Christ, who according
to the flesh sprang from that seed, is recognised, whether
they will or no, even by those who have continued to be the
enemies of this name. He is the God whose divine Spirit
spake by the men whose predictions I cited in the preceding
books, and which are fulfilled in the Church which has extended
over all the world. This is the God whom Varro, the
most learned of the Romans, supposed to be Jupiter, though
he knows not what he says; yet I think it right to note the
circumstance that a man of such learning was unable to suppose
that this God had no existence or was contemptible, but
believed Him to be the same as the supreme God. In fine,
He is the God whom Porphyry, the most learned of the philosophers,
though the bitterest enemy of the Christians, confesses
to be a great God, even according to the oracles of those
whom he esteems gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">23. <i>Porphyry's account of the responses given by the oracles of the gods concerning
Christ.</i></p>

<p>For in his book called &#7952;&#954; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#969;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;&#962;, in which he
collects and comments upon the responses which he pretends
were uttered by the gods concerning divine things, he says&mdash;I
give his own words as they have been translated from the
Greek: "To one who inquired what god he should propitiate
in order to recall his wife from Christianity, Apollo replied in
the following verses." Then the following words are given as
those of Apollo: "You will probably find it easier to write
lasting characters on the water, or lightly fly like a bird
through the air, than to restore right feeling in your impious
wife once she has polluted herself. Let her remain as she
pleases in her foolish deception, and sing false laments to her
dead God, who was condemned by right-minded judges, and
perished ignominiously by a violent death." Then after these
verses of Apollo (which we have given in a Latin version that
does not preserve the metrical form), he goes on to say: "In
these verses Apollo exposed the incurable corruption of the
Christians, saying that the Jews, rather than the Christians,
recognised God." See how he misrepresents Christ, giving
the Jews the preference to the Christians in the recognition of
God. This was his explanation of Apollo's verses, in which
he says that Christ was put to death by right-minded or just
judges,&mdash;in other words, that He deserved to die. I leave the
responsibility of this oracle regarding Christ on the lying interpreter
of Apollo, or on this philosopher who believed it or
possibly himself invented it; as to its agreement with Porphyry's
opinions or with other oracles, we shall in a little
have something to say. In this passage, however, he says
that the Jews, as the interpreters of God, judged justly in
pronouncing Christ to be worthy of the most shameful death.
He should have listened, then, to this God of the Jews to whom
he bears this testimony, when that God says, "He that sacrificeth
to any other god save to the Lord alone shall be utterly destroyed."
But let us come to still plainer expressions, and
hear how great a God Porphyry thinks the God of the Jews
is. Apollo, he says, when asked whether word, <i>i.e.</i> reason, or
law is the better thing, replied in the following verses. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
he gives the verses of Apollo, from which I select the following
as sufficient: "God, the Generator, and the King prior to
all things, before whom heaven and earth, and the sea, and
the hidden places of hell tremble, and the deities themselves
are afraid, for their law is the Father whom the holy Hebrews
honour." In this oracle of his god Apollo, Porphyry avowed
that the God of the Hebrews is so great that the deities themselves
are afraid before Him. I am surprised, therefore, that
when God said, He that sacrificeth to other gods shall be
utterly destroyed, Porphyry himself was not afraid lest he
should be destroyed for sacrificing to other gods.</p>

<p>This philosopher, however, has also some good to say of
Christ, oblivious, as it were, of that contumely of his of which
we have just been speaking; or as if his gods spoke evil of
Christ only while asleep, and recognised Him to be good, and
gave Him His deserved praise, when they awoke. For, as if
he were about to proclaim some marvellous thing passing
belief, he says, "What we are going to say will certainly take
some by surprise. For the gods have declared that Christ
was very pious, and has become immortal, and that they
cherish his memory: that the Christians, however, are polluted,
contaminated, and involved in error. And many other
such things," he says, "do the gods say against the Christians."
Then he gives specimens of the accusations made, as he says,
by the gods against them, and then goes on: "But to some
who asked Hecate whether Christ were a God, she replied,
You know the condition of the disembodied immortal soul,
and that if it has been severed from wisdom it always errs.
The soul you refer to is that of a man foremost in piety: they
worship it because they mistake the truth." To this so-called
oracular response he adds the following words of his own:
"Of this very pious man, then, Hecate said that the soul, like
the souls of other good men, was after death dowered with immortality,
and that the Christians through ignorance worship
it. And to those who ask why he was condemned to die,
the oracle of the goddess replied, The body, indeed, is always
exposed to torments, but the souls of the pious abide in heaven.
And the soul you inquire about has been the fatal cause of
error to other souls which were not fated to receive the gifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of the gods, and to have the knowledge of immortal Jove.
Such souls are therefore hated by the gods; for they who
were fated not to receive the gifts of the gods, and not to
know God, were fated to be involved in error by means of
him you speak of. He himself, however, was good, and
heaven has been opened to him as to other good men. You
are not, then, to speak evil of him, but to pity the folly of
men: and through him men's danger is imminent."</p>

<p>Who is so foolish as not to see that these oracles were
either composed by a clever man with a strong animus against
the Christians, or were uttered as responses by impure demons
with a similar design,&mdash;that is to say, in order that their
praise of Christ may win credence for their vituperation of
Christians; and that thus they may, if possible, close the way
of eternal salvation, which is identical with Christianity?
For they believe that they are by no means counterworking
their own hurtful craft by promoting belief in Christ, so long
as their calumniation of Christians is also accepted; for they
thus secure that even the man who thinks well of Christ declines
to become a Christian, and is therefore not delivered
from their own rule by the Christ he praises. Besides, their
praise of Christ is so contrived that whosoever believes in
Him as thus represented will not be a true Christian but
a Photinian heretic, recognising only the humanity, and not
also the divinity of Christ, and will thus be precluded from
salvation and from deliverance out of the meshes of these
devilish lies. For our part, we are no better pleased with
Hecate's praises of Christ than with Apollo's calumniation of
Him. Apollo says that Christ was put to death by right-minded
judges, implying that He was unrighteous. Hecate
says that He was a most pious man, but no more. The intention
of both is the same, to prevent men from becoming Christians,
because if this be secured, men shall never be rescued
from their power. But it is incumbent on our philosopher, or
rather on those who believe in these pretended oracles against
the Christians, first of all, if they can, to bring Apollo and
Hecate to the same mind regarding Christ, so that either both
may condemn or both praise Him. And even if they succeeded
in this, we for our part would notwithstanding repudiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the testimony of demons, whether favourable or adverse to
Christ. But when our adversaries find a god and goddess of
their own at variance about Christ, the one praising, the other
vituperating Him, they can certainly give no credence, if they
have any judgment, to mere men who blaspheme the Christians.</p>

<p>When Porphyry or Hecate praises Christ, and adds that He
gave Himself to the Christians as a fatal gift, that they might
be involved in error, he exposes, as he thinks, the causes of
this error. But before I cite his words to that purpose, I
would ask, If Christ did thus give Himself to the Christians
to involve them in error, did He do so willingly, or against
His will? If willingly, how is He righteous? If against
His will, how is He blessed? However, let us hear the
causes of this error. "There are," he says, "in a certain
place very small earthly spirits, subject to the power of evil
demons. The wise men of the Hebrews, among whom was
this Jesus, as you have heard from the oracles of Apollo cited
above, turned religious persons from these very wicked demons
and minor spirits, and taught them rather to worship the
celestial gods, and especially to adore God the Father. This,"
he said, "the gods enjoin; and we have already shown how
they admonish the soul to turn to God, and command it to
worship Him. But the ignorant and the ungodly, who are
not destined to receive favours from the gods, nor to know the
immortal Jupiter, not listening to the gods and their messages,
have turned away from all gods, and have not only refused to
hate, but have venerated the prohibited demons. Professing
to worship God, they refuse to do those things by which alone
God is worshipped. For God, indeed, being the Father of all,
is in need of nothing; but for us it is good to adore Him by
means of justice, chastity, and other virtues, and thus to make
life itself a prayer to Him, by inquiring into and imitating His
nature. For inquiry," says he, "purifies and imitation deifies
us, by moving us nearer to Him." He is right in so far as
he proclaims God the Father, and the conduct by which we
should worship Him. Of such precepts the prophetic books
of the Hebrews are full, when they praise or blame the life of
the saints. But in speaking of the Christians he is in error,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and calumniates them as much as is desired by the demons
whom he takes for gods, as if it were difficult for any man to
recollect the disgraceful and shameful actions which used to
be done in the theatres and temples to please the gods, and
to compare with these things what is heard in our churches,
and what is offered to the true God, and from this comparison
to conclude where character is edified, and where it is ruined.
But who but a diabolical spirit has told or suggested to this
man so manifest and vain a lie, as that the Christians reverenced
rather than hated the demons, whose worship the Hebrews
prohibited? But that God, whom the Hebrew sages worshipped,
forbids sacrifice to be offered even to the holy angels
of heaven and divine powers, whom we, in this our pilgrimage,
venerate and love as our most blessed fellow-citizens. For in
the law which God gave to His Hebrew people He utters
this menace, as in a voice of thunder: "He that sacrificeth
unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly
destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> And that no one might suppose that this prohibition
extends only to the very wicked demons and earthly
spirits, whom this philosopher calls very small and inferior,&mdash;for
even these are in the Scripture called gods, not of the
Hebrews, but of the nations, as the Septuagint translators have
shown in the psalm where it is said, "For all the gods of the
nations are demons,"<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>&mdash;that no one might suppose, I say, that
sacrifice to these demons was prohibited, but that sacrifice
might be offered to all or some of the celestials, it was immediately
added, "save unto the Lord alone."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The God of
the Hebrews, then, to whom this renowned philosopher bears
this signal testimony, gave to His Hebrew people a law,
composed in the Hebrew language, and not obscure and
unknown, but published now in every nation, and in this
law it is written, "He that sacrificeth unto any god, save
unto the Lord alone, he shall be utterly destroyed." What
need is there to seek further proofs in the law or the prophets
of this same thing? <i>Seek</i>, we need not say, for the passages
are neither few nor difficult to find; but what need to collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
and apply to my argument the proofs which are thickly sown
and obvious, and by which it appears clear as day that sacrifice
may be paid to none but the supreme and true God? Here
is one brief but decided, even menacing, and certainly true
utterance of that God whom the wisest of our adversaries so
highly extol. Let this be listened to, feared, fulfilled, that
there may be no disobedient soul cut off. "He that sacrifices,"
He says, not because He needs anything, but because it behoves
us to be His possession. Hence the Psalmist in the Hebrew
Scriptures sings, "I have said to the Lord, Thou art my God,
for Thou needest not my good."<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> For we ourselves, who are
His own city, are His most noble and worthy sacrifice, and it
is this mystery we celebrate in our sacrifices, which are well
known to the faithful, as we have explained in the preceding
books. For through the prophets the oracles of God declared
that the sacrifices which the Jews offered as a shadow of that
which was to be would cease, and that the nations, from the
rising to the setting of the sun, would offer one sacrifice.
From these oracles, which we now see accomplished, we have
made such selections as seemed suitable to our purpose in this
work. And therefore, where there is not this righteousness
whereby the one supreme God rules the obedient city according
to His grace, so that it sacrifices to none but Him, and
whereby, in all the citizens of this obedient city, the soul consequently
rules the body and reason the vices in the rightful
order, so that, as the individual just man, so also the community
and people of the just, live by faith, which works by
love, that love whereby man loves God as He ought to be
loved, and his neighbour as himself,&mdash;there, I say, there is
not an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment
of right, and by a community of interests. But if there is
not this, there is not a people, if our definition be true, and
therefore there is no republic; for where there is no people
there can be no republic.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>24. <i>The definition which must be given of a people and a republic, in order to
vindicate the assumption of these titles by the Romans and by other kingdoms.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But if we discard this definition of a people, and, assuming
another, say that a people is an assemblage of reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects
of their love, then, in order to discover the character of any
people, we have only to observe what they love. Yet whatever
it loves, if only it is an assemblage of reasonable beings
and not of beasts, and is bound together by an agreement as
to the objects of love, it is reasonably called a people; and
it will be a superior people in proportion as it is bound together
by higher interests, inferior in proportion as it is bound
together by lower. According to this definition of ours, the
Roman people is a people, and its weal is without doubt a
commonwealth or republic. But what its tastes were in its
early and subsequent days, and how it declined into sanguinary
seditions and then to social and civil wars, and so burst
asunder or rotted off the bond of concord in which the health
of a people consists, history shows, and in the preceding books
I have related at large. And yet I would not on this account
say either that it was not a people, or that its administration
was not a republic, so long as there remains an assemblage of
reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as
to the objects of love. But what I say of this people and of
this republic I must be understood to think and say of the
Athenians or any Greek state, of the Egyptians, of the early
Assyrian Babylon, and of every other nation, great or small,
which had a public government. For, in general, the city of
the ungodly, which did not obey the command of God that
it should offer no sacrifice save to Him alone, and which,
therefore, could not give to the soul its proper command over
the body, nor to the reason its just authority over the vices,
is void of true justice.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>That where there is no true religion there are no true virtues.</i></p>

<p>For though the soul may seem to rule the body admirably,
and the reason the vices, if the soul and reason do not themselves
obey God, as God has commanded them to serve Him,
they have no proper authority over the body and the vices. For
what kind of mistress of the body and the vices can that mind
be which is ignorant of the true God, and which, instead of
being subject to His authority, is prostituted to the corrupting
influences of the most vicious demons? It is for this reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
that the virtues which it seems to itself to possess, and by
which it restrains the body and the vices that it may obtain
and keep what it desires, are rather vices than virtues so long
as there is no reference to God in the matter. For although
some suppose that virtues which have a reference only to
themselves, and are desired only on their own account, are
yet true and genuine virtues, the fact is that even then they
are inflated with pride, and are therefore to be reckoned vices
rather than virtues. For as that which gives life to the flesh
is not derived from flesh, but is above it, so that which gives
blessed life to man is not derived from man, but is something
above him; and what I say of man is true of every celestial
power and virtue whatsoever.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>Of the peace which is enjoyed by the people that are alienated from God, and
the use made of it by the people of God in the time of its pilgrimage.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore, as the life of the flesh is the soul, so the blessed
life of man is God, of whom the sacred writings of the Hebrews
say, "Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Miserable,
therefore, is the people which is alienated from God. Yet
even this people has a peace of its own which is not to be
lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall not in the end enjoy
it, because it makes no good use of it before the end. But it
is our interest that it enjoy this peace meanwhile in this life;
for as long as the two cities are commingled, we also enjoy the
peace of Babylon. For from Babylon the people of God is so
freed that it meanwhile sojourns in its company. And therefore
the apostle also admonished the Church to pray for kings
and those in authority, assigning as the reason, "that we may
live a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and love."<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
And the prophet Jeremiah, when predicting the captivity that
was to befall the ancient people of God, and giving them the
divine command to go obediently to Babylonia, and thus serve
their God, counselled them also to pray for Babylonia, saying,
"In the peace thereof shall ye have peace,"<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>&mdash;the temporal
peace which the good and the wicked together enjoy.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>That the peace of those who serve God cannot in this mortal life be
apprehended in its perfection.</i></p>

<p>But the peace which is peculiar to ourselves we enjoy now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
with God by faith, and shall hereafter enjoy eternally with
Him by sight. But the peace which we enjoy in this life,
whether common to all or peculiar to ourselves, is rather the
solace of our misery than the positive enjoyment of felicity.
Our very righteousness, too, though true in so far as it has
respect to the true good, is yet in this life of such a kind that
it consists rather in the remission of sins than in the perfecting
of virtues. Witness the prayer of the whole city of God
in its pilgrim state, for it cries to God by the mouth of all its
members, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
And this prayer is efficacious not for those whose faith is
"without works and dead,"<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> but for those whose faith "worketh
by love."<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> For as reason, though subjected to God, is yet
"pressed down by the corruptible body,"<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> so long as it is in
this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over vice,
and therefore this prayer is needed by the righteous. For
though it exercises authority, the vices do not submit without
a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and
however thoroughly he has subdued these enemies, there steals
in some evil thing, which, if it do not find ready expression in
act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought;
and therefore his peace is not full so long as he is at war
with his vices. For it is a doubtful conflict he wages with
those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated
is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these
temptations, therefore, of all which it has been summarily
said in the divine oracles, "Is not human life upon earth a
temptation?"<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> who but a proud man can presume that he so
lives that he has no need to say to God, "Forgive us our
debts?" And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed
up with vanity, and is justly resisted by Him who abundantly
gives grace to the humble. Whence it is said, "God resisteth
the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> In this, then,
consists the righteousness of a man, that he submit himself to
God, his body to his soul, and his vices, even when they rebel,
to his reason, which either defeats or at least resists them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and also that he beg from God grace to do his duty,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and the
pardon of his sins, and that he render to God thanks for all
the blessings he receives. But, in that final peace to which
all our righteousness has reference, and for the sake of which
it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound immortality
and incorruption, and shall have no more vices, and as we
shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from
others, it will not be necessary that reason should rule vices
which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the
soul shall rule the body, with a sweetness and facility suitable
to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage. And
this condition shall there be eternal, and we shall be assured
of its eternity; and thus the peace of this blessedness and
the blessedness of this peace shall be the supreme good.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>The end of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>But, on the other hand, they who do not belong to this city
of God shall inherit eternal misery, which is also called the
second death, because the soul shall then be separated from
God its life, and therefore cannot be said to live, and the
body shall be subjected to eternal pains. And consequently
this second death shall be the more severe, because no death
shall terminate it. But war being contrary to peace, as misery
to happiness, and life to death, it is not without reason asked
what kind of war can be found in the end of the wicked
answering to the peace which is declared to be the end of the
righteous? The person who puts this question has only to
observe what it is in war that is hurtful and destructive, and he
shall see that it is nothing else than the mutual opposition and
conflict of things. And can he conceive a more grievous and
bitter war than that in which the will is so opposed to passion,
and passion to the will, that their hostility can never be terminated
by the victory of either, and in which the violence
of pain so conflicts with the nature of the body, that neither
yields to the other? For in this life, when this conflict has
arisen, either pain conquers and death expels the feeling of it,
or nature conquers and health expels the pain. But in the
world to come the pain continues that it may torment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the nature endures that it may be sensible of it; and neither
ceases to exist, lest punishment also should cease. Now, as it
is through the last judgment that men pass to these ends,
the good to the supreme good, the evil to the supreme evil,
I will treat of this judgment in the following book.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_TWENTIETH" id="BOOK_TWENTIETH">BOOK TWENTIETH.</a></h2>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<p class="center">CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT, AND THE DECLARATIONS REGARDING IT IN
THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>That although God is always judging, it is nevertheless reasonable to confine
our attention in this book to His last judgment.</i></p>

<p>Intending to speak, in dependence on God's grace, of
the day of His final judgment, and to affirm it against
the ungodly and incredulous, we must first of all lay, as it
were, in the foundation of the edifice the divine declarations.
Those persons who do not believe such declarations do their
best to oppose to them false and illusive sophisms of their
own, either contending that what is adduced from Scripture
has another meaning, or altogether denying that it is an utterance
of God's. For I suppose no man who understands what
is written, and believes it to be communicated by the supreme
and true God through holy men, refuses to yield and consent
to these declarations, whether he orally confesses his consent,
or is from some evil influence ashamed or afraid to do so; or
even, with an opinionativeness closely resembling madness,
makes strenuous efforts to defend what he knows and believes
to be false against what he knows and believes to be true.</p>

<p>That, therefore, which the whole Church of the true God
holds and professes as its creed, that Christ shall come from
heaven to judge quick and dead, this we call the last day, or
last time, of the divine judgment. For we do not know how
many days this judgment may occupy; but no one who reads
the Scriptures, however negligently, need be told that in them
"day" is customarily used for "time." And when we speak
of the day of God's judgment, we add the word last or final
for this reason, because even now God judges, and has judged
from the beginning of human history, banishing from paradise,
and excluding from the tree of life, those first men who perpetrated
so great a sin. Yea, He was certainly exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
judgment also when He did not spare the angels who sinned,
whose prince, overcome by envy, seduced men after being
himself seduced. Neither is it without God's profound and
just judgment that the life of demons and men, the one in
the air, the other on earth, is filled with misery, calamities,
and mistakes. And even though no one had sinned, it could
only have been by the good and right judgment of God that
the whole rational creation could have been maintained in
eternal blessedness by a persevering adherence to its Lord.
He judges, too, not only in the mass, condemning the race of
devils and the race of men to be miserable on account of the
original sin of these races, but He also judges the voluntary
and personal acts of individuals. For even the devils pray
that they may not be tormented,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> which proves that without
injustice they might either be spared or tormented according
to their deserts. And men are punished by God for their
sins often visibly, always secretly, either in this life or after
death, although no man acts rightly save by the assistance of
divine aid; and no man or devil acts unrighteously save by
the permission of the divine and most just judgment. For, as
the apostle says, "There is no unrighteousness with God;"<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
and as he elsewhere says, "His judgments are inscrutable,
and His ways past finding out."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> In this book, then, I shall
speak, as God permits, not of those first judgments, nor of
these intervening judgments of God, but of the last judgment,
when Christ is to come from heaven to judge the quick and
the dead. For that day is properly called the day of judgment,
because in it there shall be no room left for the ignorant
questioning why this wicked person is happy and that
righteous man unhappy. In that day true and full happiness
shall be the lot of none but the good, while deserved and
supreme misery shall be the portion of the wicked, and of
them only.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>That in the mingled web of human affairs God's judgment is present, though
it cannot be discerned.</i></p>

<p>In this present time we learn to bear with equanimity the
ills to which even good men are subject, and to hold cheap
the blessings which even the wicked enjoy. And consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
even in those conditions of life in which the justice
of God is not apparent, His teaching is salutary. For we do
not know by what judgment of God this good man is poor
and that bad man rich; why he who, in our opinion, ought
to suffer acutely for his abandoned life enjoys himself, while
sorrow pursues him whose praiseworthy life leads us to suppose
he should be happy; why the innocent man is dismissed from
the bar not only unavenged, but even condemned, being either
wronged by the iniquity of the judge, or overwhelmed by
false evidence, while his guilty adversary, on the other hand,
is not only discharged with impunity, but even has his claims
admitted; why the ungodly enjoys good health, while the godly
pines in sickness; why ruffians are of the soundest constitution,
while they who could not hurt any one even with a
word are from infancy afflicted with complicated disorders;
why he who is useful to society is cut off by premature death,
while those who, as it might seem, ought never to have been
so much as born have lives of unusual length; why he who
is full of crimes is crowned with honours, while the blameless
man is buried in the darkness of neglect. But who can collect
or enumerate all the contrasts of this kind? But if this
anomalous state of things were uniform in this life, in which,
as the sacred Psalmist says, "Man is like to vanity, his days
as a shadow that passeth away,"<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>&mdash;so uniform that none but
wicked men won the transitory prosperity of earth, while only
the good suffered its ills,&mdash;this could be referred to the just and
even benign judgment of God. We might suppose that they
who were not destined to obtain those everlasting benefits
which constitute human blessedness were either deluded by
transitory blessings as the just reward of their wickedness, or
were, in God's mercy, consoled by them, and that they who
were not destined to suffer eternal torments were afflicted
with temporal chastisement for their sins, or were stimulated to
greater attainment in virtue. But now, as it is, since we not
only see good men involved in the ills of life, and bad men
enjoying the good of it, which seems unjust, but also that evil
often overtakes evil men, and good surprises the good, the
rather on this account are God's judgments unsearchable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
His ways past finding out. Although, therefore, we do not
know by what judgment these things are done or permitted
to be done by God, with whom is the highest virtue, the
highest wisdom, the highest justice, no infirmity, no rashness,
no unrighteousness, yet it is salutary for us to learn to hold
cheap such things, be they good or evil, as attach indifferently
to good men and bad, and to covet those good things
which belong only to good men, and flee those evils which
belong only to evil men. But when we shall have come to
that judgment, the date of which is called peculiarly the day
of judgment, and sometimes the day of the Lord, we shall
then recognise the justice of all God's judgments, not only of
such as shall then be pronounced, but of all which take effect
from the beginning, or may take effect before that time. And
in that day we shall also recognise with what justice so many,
or almost all, the just judgments of God in the present life
defy the scrutiny of human sense or insight, though in this
matter it is not concealed from pious minds that what is concealed
is just.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>What Solomon, in the book of Ecclesiastes, says regarding the things which
happen alike to good and wicked men.</i></p>

<p>Solomon, the wisest king of Israel, who reigned in Jerusalem,
thus commences the book called Ecclesiastes, which
the Jews number among their canonical Scriptures: "Vanity
of vanities, said Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he hath
taken under the sun?"<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> And after going on to enumerate,
with this as his text, the calamities and delusions of this
life, and the shifting nature of the present time, in which
there is nothing substantial, nothing lasting, he bewails,
among the other vanities that are under the sun, this also,
that though wisdom excelleth folly as light excelleth darkness,
and though the eyes of the wise man are in his head, while
the fool walketh in darkness,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> yet one event happeneth to
them all, that is to say, in this life under the sun, unquestionably
alluding to those evils which we see befall good and
bad men alike. He says, further, that the good suffer the ills
of life as if they were evil-doers, and the bad enjoy the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of life as if they were good. "There is a vanity which is
done upon the earth; that there be just men unto whom it
happeneth according to the work of the wicked: again, there
be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work
of the righteous. I said, that this also is vanity."<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> This
wisest man devoted this whole book to a full exposure of this
vanity, evidently with no other object than that we might
long for that life in which there is no vanity under the sun,
but verity under Him who made the sun. In this vanity,
then, was it not by the just and righteous judgment of God
that man, made like to vanity, was destined to pass away?
But in these days of vanity it makes an important difference
whether he resists or yields to the truth, and whether he is destitute
of true piety or a partaker of it,&mdash;important not so far as
regards the acquirement of the blessings or the evasion of the
calamities of this transitory and vain life, but in connection
with the future judgment which shall make over to good men
good things, and to bad men bad things, in permanent, inalienable
possession. In fine, this wise man concludes this
book of his by saying, "Fear God, and keep His commandments:
for this is every man. For God shall bring every
work into judgment, with every despised person, whether it
be good, or whether it be evil."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> What truer, terser, more
salutary enouncement could be made? "Fear God," he says,
"and keep His commandments: for this is every man." For
whosoever has real existence, is this, is a keeper of God's
commandments; and he who is not this, is nothing. For so
long as he remains in the likeness of vanity, he is not renewed
in the image of the truth. "For God shall bring into judgment
every work,"&mdash;that is, whatever man does in this life,&mdash;"whether
it be good or whether it be evil, with every
despised person,"&mdash;that is, with every man who here seems
despicable, and is therefore not considered; for God sees
even him, and does not despise him nor pass him over in His
judgment.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>That proofs of the last judgment will be adduced, first from the New
Testament, and then from the Old.</i></p>

<p>The proofs, then, of this last judgment of God which I propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
to adduce shall be drawn first from the New Testament,
and then from the Old. For although the Old Testament is
prior in point of time, the New has the precedence in intrinsic
value; for the Old acts the part of herald to the New. We
shall therefore first cite passages from the New Testament,
and confirm them by quotations from the Old Testament.
The Old contains the law and the prophets, the New the gospel
and the apostolic epistles. Now the apostle says, "By the
law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of
God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the
law and the prophets; now the righteousness of God is by
faith of Jesus Christ upon all them that believe."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> This
righteousness of God belongs to the New Testament, and
evidence for it exists in the old books, that is to say, in
the law and the prophets. I shall first, then, state the case,
and then call the witnesses. This order Jesus Christ Himself
directs us to observe, saying, "The scribe instructed in the
kingdom of God is like a good householder, bringing out of
his treasure things new and old."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> He did not say "old and
new," which He certainly would have said had He not wished
to follow the order of merit rather than that of time.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>The passages in which the Saviour declares that there shall be a divine judgment
in the end of the world.</i></p>

<p>The Saviour Himself, while reproving the cities in which
He had done great works, but which had not believed, and
while setting them in unfavourable comparison with foreign
cities, says, "But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you."<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
And a little after He says, "Verily, I say unto you, It shall
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment
than for thee."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Here He most plainly predicts that a
day of judgment is to come. And in another place He says,
"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with
this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
uttermost parts of the earth to hear the words of Solomon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Two things
we learn from this passage, that a judgment is to take place,
and that it is to take place at the resurrection of the dead.
For when He spoke of the Ninevites and the queen of the
south, He certainly spoke of dead persons, and yet He said
that they should rise up in the day of judgment. He did not
say, "They shall condemn," as if they themselves were to be
the judges, but because, in comparison with them, the others
shall be justly condemned.</p>

<p>Again, in another passage, in which He was speaking of the
present intermingling and future separation of the good and
bad,&mdash;the separation which shall be made in the day of judgment,&mdash;He
adduced a comparison drawn from the sown wheat
and the tares sown among them, and gave this explanation of
it to His disciples: "He that soweth the good seed is the Son
of man,"<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> etc. Here, indeed, He did not name the judgment
or the day of judgment, but indicated it much more clearly by
describing the circumstances, and foretold that it should take
place in the end of the world.</p>

<p>In like manner He says to His disciples, "Verily I say
unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration,
when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye
also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Here we learn that Jesus shall judge with His
disciples. And therefore He said elsewhere to the Jews,
"If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
Neither ought we to suppose that only twelve men shall judge
along with Him, though He says that they shall sit upon
twelve thrones, for by the number twelve is signified the
completeness of the multitude of those who shall judge. For
the two parts of the number seven (which commonly symbolizes
totality), that is to say, four and three, multiplied into one
another, give twelve. For four times three, or three times
four, are twelve. There are other meanings, too, in this
number twelve. Were not this the right interpretation of
the twelve thrones, then since we read that Matthias was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
ordained an apostle in the room of Judas the traitor, the
Apostle Paul, though he laboured more than them all,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> should
have no throne of judgment; but he unmistakeably considers
himself to be included in the number of the judges when he
says, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The same
rule is to be observed in applying the number twelve to those
who are to be judged. For though it was said, "judging the
twelve tribes of Israel," the tribe of Levi, which is the
thirteenth, shall not on this account be exempt from judgment,
neither shall judgment be passed only on Israel and
not on the other nations. And by the words "in the regeneration"
He certainly meant the resurrection of the dead
to be understood; for our flesh shall be regenerated by incorruption,
as our soul is regenerated by faith.</p>

<p>Many passages I omit, because, though they seem to refer
to the last judgment, yet on a closer examination they are
found to be ambiguous, or to allude rather to some other
event,&mdash;whether to that coming of the Saviour which continually
occurs in His Church, that is, in His members, in
which He comes little by little, and piece by piece, since the
whole Church is His body, or to the destruction of the
earthly Jerusalem. For when He speaks even of this, He often
uses language which is applicable to the end of the world and
that last and great day of judgment, so that these two events
cannot be distinguished unless all the corresponding passages
bearing on the subject in the three evangelists, Matthew,
Mark, and Luke, are compared with one another,&mdash;for some
things are put more obscurely by one evangelist and more
plainly by another,&mdash;so that it becomes apparent what things
are meant to be referred to one event. It is this which I
have been at pains to do in a letter which I wrote to Hesychius
of blessed memory, bishop of Salon, and entitled, "Of
the End of the World."<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>I shall now cite from the Gospel according to Matthew the
passage which speaks of the separation of the good from the
wicked by the most efficacious and final judgment of Christ:
"When the Son of man," he says, "shall come in His glory, ...
then shall He say also unto them on His left hand, Depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels."<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Then He in like manner recounts to the
wicked the things they had not done, but which He had said
those on the right hand had done. And when they ask when
they had seen Him in need of these things, He replies that,
inasmuch as they had not done it to the least of His brethren,
they had not done it unto Him, and concludes His address in
the words, "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment,
but the righteous into life eternal." Moreover, the evangelist
John most distinctly states that He had predicted that the
judgment should be at the resurrection of the dead. For after
saying, "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
judgment unto the Son; that all men should honour the Son,
even as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the
Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent Him;" He immediately
adds, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth
my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death
to life."<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Here He said that believers on Him should not
come into judgment. How, then, shall they be separated from
the wicked by judgment, and be set at His right hand, unless
judgment be in this passage used for condemnation? For into
judgment, in this sense, they shall not come who hear His
word, and believe on Him that sent Him.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>What is the first resurrection, and what the second.</i></p>

<p>After that He adds the words, "Verily, verily, I say unto
you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall
hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall
live. For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He
given to the Son to have life in Himself."<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> As yet He does
not speak of the second resurrection, that is, the resurrection
of the body, which shall be in the end, but of the first, which
now is. It is for the sake of making this distinction that He
says, "The hour is coming, and now is." Now this resurrection
regards not the body, but the soul. For souls, too, have a
death of their own in wickedness and sins, whereby they are
the dead of whom the same lips say, "Suffer the dead to bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
their dead,"<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>&mdash;that is, let those who are dead in soul bury them
that are dead in body. It is of these dead, then&mdash;the dead
in ungodliness and wickedness&mdash;that He says, "The hour is
coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the
Son of God; and they that hear shall live." "They that hear,"
that is, they who obey, believe, and persevere to the end.
Here no difference is made between the good and the bad.
For it is good for all men to hear His voice and live, by
passing to the life of godliness from the death of ungodliness.
Of this death the Apostle Paul says, "Therefore all are dead,
and He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them and
rose again."<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Thus all, without one exception, were dead in
sins, whether original or voluntary sins, sins of ignorance, or
sins committed against knowledge; and for all the dead there
died the one only person who lived, that is, who had no sin
whatever, in order that they who live by the remission of
their sins should live, not to themselves, but to Him who
died for all, for our sins, and rose again for our justification,
that we, believing in Him who justifies the ungodly, and
being justified from ungodliness or quickened from death,
may be able to attain to the first resurrection which now is.
For in this first resurrection none have a part save those who
shall be eternally blessed; but in the second, of which He
goes on to speak, all, as we shall learn, have a part, both the
blessed and the wretched. The one is the resurrection of
mercy, the other of judgment. And therefore it is written in
the psalm, "I will sing of mercy and of judgment: unto Thee,
O Lord, will I sing."<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>And of this judgment He went on to say, "And hath given
Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the
Son of man." Here He shows that He will come to judge in
that flesh in which He had come to be judged. For it is to
show this He says, "because He is the Son of man." And
then follow the words for our purpose: "Marvel not at this:
for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have
done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> This judgment
He uses here in the same sense as a little before, when
He says, "He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him
that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
<i>judgment</i>, but is passed from death to life;" <i>i.e.</i>, by having a
part in the first resurrection, by which a transition from death
to life is made in this present time, he shall not come into
damnation, which He mentions by the name of judgment, as
also in the place where He says, "but they that have done evil
unto the resurrection of judgment," <i>i.e.</i> of damnation. He,
therefore, who would not be damned in the second resurrection,
let him rise in the first. For "the hour is coming, and now
is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
they that hear shall live," <i>i.e.</i> shall not come into damnation,
which is called the second death; into which death, after the
second or bodily resurrection, they shall be hurled who do not
rise in the first or spiritual resurrection. For "the hour is
coming" (but here He does not say, "and now is," because it
shall come in the end of the world in the last and greatest
judgment of God) "when all that are in the graves shall hear
His voice and shall come forth." He does not say, as in the
first resurrection, "And they that hear shall live." For all
shall not live, at least with such life as ought alone to be
called life because it alone is blessed. For some kind of life
they must have in order to hear, and come forth from the
graves in their rising bodies. And why all shall not live He
teaches in the words that follow: "They that have done good,
to the resurrection of life,"&mdash;these are they who shall live;
"but they that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment,"&mdash;these
are they who shall not live, for they shall die
in the second death. They have done evil because their life
has been evil; and their life has been evil because it has not
been renewed in the first or spiritual resurrection which now
is, or because they have not persevered to the end in their
renewed life. As, then, there are two regenerations, of which
I have already made mention,&mdash;the one according to faith, and
which takes place in the present life by means of baptism;
the other according to the flesh, and which shall be accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
in its incorruption and immortality by means of the
great and final judgment,&mdash;so are there also two resurrections,&mdash;the
one the first and spiritual resurrection, which has place in
this life, and preserves us from coming into the second death;
the other the second, which does not occur now, but in the
end of the world, and which is of the body, not of the soul,
and which by the last judgment shall dismiss some into the
second death, others into that life which has no death.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>7. <i>What is written in the Revelation of John regarding the two resurrections,
and the thousand years, and what may reasonably be held on these points.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The evangelist John has spoken of these two resurrections
in the book which is called the Apocalypse, but in such a
way that some Christians do not understand the first of the
two, and so construe the passage into ridiculous fancies. For
the Apostle John says in the foresaid book, "And I saw an
angel come down from heaven.... Blessed and holy is he
that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second
death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of
Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> Those
who, on the strength of this passage, have suspected that the
first resurrection is future and bodily, have been moved, among
other things, specially by the number of a thousand years, as
if it were a fit thing that the saints should thus enjoy a kind
of Sabbath-rest during that period, a holy leisure after the
labours of the six thousand years since man was created, and
was on account of his great sin dismissed from the blessedness
of paradise into the woes of this mortal life, so that thus, as it
is written, "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
and a thousand years as one day,"<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> there should follow on
the completion of six thousand years, as of six days, a kind of
seventh-day Sabbath in the succeeding thousand years; and
that it is for this purpose the saints rise, viz. to celebrate
this Sabbath. And this opinion would not be objectionable,
if it were believed that the joys of the saints in that Sabbath
shall be spiritual, and consequent on the presence of God;
for I myself, too, once held this opinion.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> But, as they assert
that those who then rise again shall enjoy the leisure of immoderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
carnal banquets, furnished with an amount of meat
and drink such as not only to shock the feeling of the temperate,
but even to surpass the measure of credulity itself,
such assertions can be believed only by the carnal. They who
do believe them are called by the spiritual Chiliasts, which
we may literally reproduce by the name Millenarians.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> It
were a tedious process to refute these opinions point by point:
we prefer proceeding to show how that passage of Scripture
should be understood.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus Christ Himself says, "No man can enter
into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first
bind the strong man,"<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>&mdash;meaning by the strong man the devil,
because he had power to take captive the human race; and
meaning by his goods which he was to take, those who had
been held by the devil in divers sins and iniquities, but were
to become believers in Himself. It was then for the binding
of this strong one that the apostle saw in the Apocalypse "an
angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss,
and a chain in his hand. And he laid hold," he says, "on the
dragon, that old serpent, which is called the devil and Satan,
and bound him a thousand years,"&mdash;that is, bridled and restrained
his power so that he could not seduce and gain possession
of those who were to be freed. Now the thousand
years may be understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me:
either because these things happen in the sixth thousand of
years or sixth millennium (the latter part of which is now passing),
as if during the sixth day, which is to be followed by a
Sabbath which has no evening, the endless rest of the saints,
so that, speaking of a part under the name of the whole, he
calls the last part of the millennium&mdash;the part, that is, which
had yet to expire before the end of the world&mdash;a thousand
years; or he used the thousand years as an equivalent for the
whole duration of this world, employing the number of perfection
to mark the fulness of time. For a thousand is the
cube of ten. For ten times ten makes a hundred, that is, the
square on a plane superficies. But to give this superficies
height, and make it a cube, the hundred is again multiplied
by ten, which gives a thousand. Besides, if a hundred is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
sometimes used for totality, as when the Lord said by way of
promise to him that left all and followed Him, "He shall receive
in this world an hundredfold;"<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> of which the apostle gives,
as it were, an explanation when he says, "As having nothing,
yet possessing all things,"<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>&mdash;for even of old it had been said,
The whole world is the wealth of a believer,&mdash;with how much
greater reason is a thousand put for totality since it is the
cube, while the other is only the square? And for the same
reason we cannot better interpret the words of the psalm,
"He hath been mindful of His covenant for ever, the word
which He commanded to a thousand generations,"<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> than by
understanding it to mean "to all generations."</p>

<p>"And he cast him into the abyss,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> cast the devil
into the abyss. By the <i>abyss</i> is meant the countless multitude
of the wicked whose hearts are unfathomably deep in
malignity against the Church of God; not that the devil was
not there before, but he is said to be cast in thither, because,
when prevented from harming believers, he takes more complete
possession of the ungodly. For that man is more abundantly
possessed by the devil who is not only alienated from
God, but also gratuitously hates those who serve God. "And
shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive
the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled."
"Shut him up,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> prohibited him from going out, from doing
what was forbidden. And the addition of "set a seal upon
him" seems to me to mean that it was designed to keep it a
secret who belonged to the devil's party and who did not.
For in this world this is a secret, for we cannot tell whether
even the man who seems to stand shall fall, or whether he
who seems to lie shall rise again. But by the chain and
prisonhouse of this interdict the devil is prohibited and restrained
from seducing those nations which belong to Christ,
but which he formerly seduced or held in subjection. For
before the foundation of the world God chose to rescue these
from the power of darkness, and to translate them into the
kingdom of the Son of His love, as the apostle says.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> For
what Christian is not aware that he seduces nations even now,
and draws them with himself to eternal punishment, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
those predestined to eternal life? And let no one be dismayed
by the circumstance that the devil often seduces even those
who have been regenerated in Christ, and begun to walk in
God's way. For "the Lord knoweth them that are His,"<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> and
of these the devil seduces none to eternal damnation. For
it is as God, from whom nothing is hid even of things future,
that the Lord knows them; not as a man, who sees a man at
the present time (if he can be said to see one whose heart he
does not see), but does not see even himself so far as to be
able to know what kind of person he is to be. The devil,
then, is bound and shut up in the abyss that he may not
seduce the nations from which the Church is gathered, and
which he formerly seduced before the Church existed. For
it is not said "that he should not seduce any man," but "that
he should not seduce the nations"&mdash;meaning, no doubt, those
among which the Church exists&mdash;"till the thousand years
should be fulfilled,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> either what remains of the sixth day
which consists of a thousand years, or all the years which are
to elapse till the end of the world.</p>

<p>The words, "that he should not seduce the nations till the
thousand years should be fulfilled," are not to be understood
as indicating that afterwards he is to seduce only those nations
from which the predestined Church is composed, and from
seducing whom he is restrained by that chain and imprisonment;
but they are used in conformity with that usage frequently
employed in Scripture and exemplified in the psalm,
"So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until He have
mercy upon us,"<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>&mdash;not as if the eyes of His servants would no
longer wait upon the Lord their God when He had mercy upon
them. Or the order of the words is unquestionably this, "And
he shut him up and set a seal upon him, till the thousand
years should be fulfilled;" and the interposed clause, "that he
should seduce the nations no more," is not to be understood
in the connection in which it stands, but separately, and as if
added afterwards, so that the whole sentence might be read,
"And He shut him up and set a seal upon him till the
thousand years should be fulfilled, that he should seduce the
nations no more,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> he is shut up till the thousand years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
be fulfilled, on this account, that he may no more deceive the
nations.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of the binding and loosing of the devil.</i></p>

<p>"After that," says John, "he must be loosed a little season."
If the binding and shutting up of the devil means his being
made unable to seduce the Church, must his loosing be the
recovery of this ability? By no means. For the Church predestined
and elected before the foundation of the world, the
Church of which it is said, "The Lord knoweth them that are
His," shall never be seduced by him. And yet there shall be
a Church in this world even when the devil shall be loosed,
as there has been since the beginning, and shall be always,
the places of the dying being filled by new believers. For a
little after John says that the devil, being loosed, shall draw
the nations whom he has seduced in the whole world to make
war against the Church, and that the number of these enemies
shall be as the sand of the sea. "And they went up on the
breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints
about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God
out of heaven and devoured them. And the devil who seduced
them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the
beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and
night for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> This relates to the last judgment,
but I have thought fit to mention it now, lest any one might
suppose that in that short time during which the devil shall
be loose there shall be no Church upon earth, whether because
the devil finds no Church, or destroys it by manifold persecutions.
The devil, then, is not bound during the whole time
which this book embraces,&mdash;that is, from the first coming of
Christ to the end of the world, when He shall come the second
time,&mdash;not bound in this sense, that during this interval, which
goes by the name of a thousand years, he shall not seduce the
Church, for not even when loosed shall he seduce it. For certainly
if his being bound means that he is not able or not permitted
to seduce the Church, what can the loosing of him
mean but his being able or permitted to do so? But God
forbid that such should be the case! But the binding of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
devil is his being prevented from the exercise of his whole
power to seduce men, either by violently forcing or fraudulently
deceiving them into taking part with him. If he were
during so long a period permitted to assail the weakness of
men, very many persons, such as God would not wish to expose
to such temptation, would have their faith overthrown, or
would be prevented from believing; and that this might not
happen, he is bound.</p>

<p>But when the short time comes he shall be loosed. For he
shall rage with the whole force of himself and his angels for
three years and six months; and those with whom he makes war
shall have power to withstand all his violence and stratagems.
And if he were never loosed, his malicious power would be less
patent, and less proof would be given of the stedfast fortitude of
the holy city: it would, in short, be less manifest what good
use the Almighty makes of his great evil. For the Almighty
does not absolutely seclude the saints from his temptation, but
shelters only their inner man, where faith resides, that by outward
temptation they may grow in grace. And He binds him
that he may not, in the free and eager exercise of his malice,
hinder or destroy the faith of those countless weak persons,
already believing or yet to believe, from whom the Church
must be increased and completed; and he will in the end
loose him, that the city of God may see how mighty an adversary
it has conquered, to the great glory of its Redeemer,
Helper, Deliverer. And what are we in comparison with those
believers and saints who shall then exist, seeing that they
shall be tested by the loosing of an enemy with whom we
make war at the greatest peril even when he is bound?
Although it is also certain that even in this intervening period
there have been and are some soldiers of Christ so wise and
strong, that if they were to be alive in this mortal condition
at the time of his loosing, they would both most wisely
guard against, and most patiently endure, all his snares and
assaults.</p>

<p>Now the devil was thus bound not only when the Church
began to be more and more widely extended among the nations
beyond Judea, but is now and shall be bound till the end of
the world, when he is to be loosed. Because even now men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
are, and doubtless to the end of the world shall be, converted
to the faith from the unbelief in which he held them.
And this strong one is bound in each instance in which he is
spoiled of one of his goods; and the abyss in which he is shut
up is not at an end when those die who were alive when first
he was shut up in it, but these have been succeeded, and shall
to the end of the world be succeeded, by others born after
them with a like hate of the Christians, and in the depth of
whose blind hearts he is continually shut up as in an abyss.
But it is a question whether, during these three years and six
months when he shall be loose, and raging with all his force,
any one who has not previously believed shall attach himself
to the faith. For how in that case would the words hold
good, "Who entereth into the house of a strong one to spoil
his goods, unless first he shall have bound the strong one?"
Consequently this verse seems to compel us to believe that
during that time, short as it is, no one will be added to the
Christian community, but that the devil will make war with
those who have previously become Christians, and that, though
some of these may be conquered and desert to the devil, these
do not belong to the predestinated number of the sons of
God: For it is not without reason that John, the same
apostle as wrote this Apocalypse, says in his epistle regarding
certain persons, "They went out from us, but they were not
of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have
remained with us."<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> But what shall become of the little
ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days there shall
not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized,
and that there shall not also be some born during that very
period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their
parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver
of regeneration. But if this shall be the case, how shall these
goods be snatched from the devil when he is loose, since into
his house no man enters to spoil his goods unless he has first
bound him? On the contrary, we are rather to believe that
in these days there shall be no lack either of those who fall
away from, or of those who attach themselves to the Church;
but there shall be such resoluteness, both in parents to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
baptism for their little ones, and in those who shall then first
believe, that they shall conquer that strong one, even though
unbound,&mdash;that is, shall both vigilantly comprehend, and
patiently bear up against him, though employing such wiles
and putting forth such force as he never before used; and
thus they shall be snatched from him even though unbound.
And yet the verse of the Gospel will not be untrue, "Who
entereth into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods,
unless he shall first have bound the strong one?" For in
accordance with this true saying that order is observed&mdash;the
strong one first bound, and then his goods spoiled; for the
Church is so increased by the weak and strong from all
nations far and near, that by its most robust faith in things
divinely predicted and accomplished, it shall be able to spoil
the goods of even the unbound devil. For as we must own
that, "when iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold,"<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>
and that those who have not been written in the book of life
shall in large numbers yield to the severe and unprecedented
persecutions and stratagems of the devil now loosed, so we
cannot but think that not only those whom that time shall
find sound in the faith, but also some who till then shall be
without, shall become firm in the faith they have hitherto
rejected, and mighty to conquer the devil even though unbound,
God's grace aiding them to understand the Scriptures,
in which, among other things, there is foretold that very end
which they themselves see to be arriving. And if this shall
be so, his binding is to be spoken of as preceding, that there
might follow a spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it
is of this it is said, "Who shall enter into the house of the
strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound
the strong one?"</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>What the reign of the saints with Christ for a thousand years is, and how it
differs from the eternal kingdom.</i></p>

<p>But while the devil is bound, the saints reign with Christ
during the same thousand years, understood in the same way,
that is, of the time of His first coming.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> For, leaving out of

called His kingdom or the kingdom of heaven unless His
saints were even now reigning with Him, though in another
and far different way; for to His saints He says, "Lo, I am
with you always, even to the end of the world."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Certainly
it is in this present time that the scribe well instructed in the
kingdom of God, and of whom we have already spoken, brings
forth from his treasure things new and old. And from the
Church those reapers shall gather out the tares which He
suffered to grow with the wheat till the harvest, as He explains
in the words, "The harvest is the end of the world; and
the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered
together and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of the
world. The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall
gather out of His kingdom all offences."<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Can He mean out
of that kingdom in which are no offences? Then it must be
out of His present kingdom, the Church, that they are gathered.
So He says, "He that breaketh one of the least of these commandments,
and teacheth men so, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth and teacheth thus
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> He speaks
of both as being in the kingdom of heaven, both the man who
does not perform the commandments which He teaches,&mdash;for
"to break" means not to keep, not to perform,&mdash;and the man
who does and teaches as He did; but the one He calls least,
the other great. And He immediately adds, "For I say unto
you, that except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes
and Pharisees,"&mdash;that is, the righteousness of those who break
what they teach; for of the scribes and Pharisees He elsewhere
says, "For they say and do not;"<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>&mdash;unless, therefore,
your righteousness exceed theirs, that is, so that you do not
break but rather do what you teach, "ye shall not enter the
kingdom of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> We must understand in one sense the
kingdom of heaven in which exist together both he who breaks
what he teaches and he who does it, the one being least, the
other great, and in another sense the kingdom of heaven into
which only he who does what he teaches shall enter. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now
is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the Church as it
is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in her.
Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and
the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, even now His saints
reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign
hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church
along with the wheat, they do not reign with Him. For they
reign with Him who do what the apostle says, "If ye be risen
with Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ
sitteth at the right hand of God. Seek those things which
are above, not the things which are on the earth."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Of such
persons he also says that their conversation is in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
In fine, they reign with Him who are so in His kingdom that
they themselves are His kingdom. But in what sense are
those the kingdom of Christ who, to say no more, though
they are in it until all offences are gathered out of it at the
end of the world, yet seek their own things in it, and not the
things that are Christ's?<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>It is then of this kingdom militant, in which conflict with
the enemy is still maintained, and war carried on with warring
lusts, or government laid upon them as they yield, until
we come to that most peaceful kingdom in which we shall
reign without an enemy, and it is of this first resurrection in
the present life, that the Apocalypse speaks in the words just
quoted. For, after saying that the devil is bound a thousand
years and is afterwards loosed for a short season, it goes on
to give a sketch of what the Church does or of what is done
in the Church in those days, in the words, "And I saw seats
and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given." It
is not to be supposed that this refers to the last judgment, but
to the seats of the rulers and to the rulers themselves by whom
the Church is now governed. And no better interpretation of
judgment being given can be produced than that which we
have in the words, "What ye bind on earth shall be bound
in heaven; and what ye loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Whence the apostle says, "What have I to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
with judging them that are without? do not ye judge them
that are within?"<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> "And the souls," says John, "of those
who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of
God,"&mdash;understanding what he afterwards says, "reigned with
Christ a thousand years,"<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>&mdash;that is, the souls of the martyrs
not yet restored to their bodies. For the souls of the pious
dead are not separated from the Church, which even now is
the kingdom of Christ; otherwise there would be no remembrance
made of them at the altar of God in the partaking
of the body of Christ, nor would it do any good in danger
to run to His baptism, that we might not pass from this life
without it; nor to reconciliation, if by penitence or a bad
conscience any one may be severed from His body. For why
are these things practised, if not because the faithful, even
though dead, are His members? Therefore, while these thousand
years run on, their souls reign with Him, though not as yet in
conjunction with their bodies. And therefore in another part
of this same book we read, "Blessed are the dead who die in
the Lord from henceforth: and now, saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours; for their works do follow them."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
The Church, then, begins its reign with Christ now in the
living and in the dead. For, as the apostle says, "Christ died
that He might be Lord both of the living and of the dead."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
But he mentioned the souls of the martyrs only, because they
who have contended even to death for the truth, themselves
principally reign after death; but, taking the part for the
whole, we understand the words of all others who belong to
the Church, which is the kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>As to the words following, "And if any have not worshipped
the beast nor his image, nor have received his inscription
on their forehead, or on their hand," we must take
them of both the living and the dead. And what this beast is,
though it requires a more careful investigation, yet it is not
inconsistent with the true faith to understand it of the ungodly
city itself, and the community of unbelievers set in
opposition to the faithful people and the city of God. "His
image" seems to me to mean his simulation, to wit, in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
men who profess to believe, but live as unbelievers. For they
pretend to be what they are not, and are called Christians,
not from a true likeness, but from a deceitful image. For to
this beast belong not only the avowed enemies of the name
of Christ and His most glorious city, but also the tares which
are to be gathered out of His kingdom, the Church, in the end
of the world. And who are they who do not worship the
beast and his image, if not those who do what the apostle
says, "Be not yoked with unbelievers?"<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> For such do not
worship, <i>i.e.</i> do not consent, are not subjected; neither do
they receive the inscription, the brand of crime, on their forehead
by their profession, on their hand by their practice.
They, then, who are free from these pollutions, whether they
still live in this mortal flesh, or are dead, reign with Christ
even now, through this whole interval which is indicated by
the thousand years, in a fashion suited to this time.</p>

<p>"The rest of them," he says, "did not live." For now is
the hour when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God, and they that hear shall live; and the rest of them
shall not live. The words added, "until the thousand years
are finished," mean that they did not live in the time in which
they ought to have lived by passing from death to life. And
therefore, when the day of the bodily resurrection arrives, they
shall come out of their graves, not to life, but to judgment,
namely, to damnation, which is called the second death. For
whosoever has not lived until the thousand years be finished,
<i>i.e.</i> during this whole time in which the first resurrection is
going on,&mdash;whosoever has not heard the voice of the Son of
God, and passed from death to life,&mdash;that man shall certainly in
the second resurrection, the resurrection of the flesh, pass with
his flesh into the second death. For he goes on to say, "This
is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath
part in the first resurrection," or who experiences it. Now
he experiences it who not only revives from the death of sin,
but continues in this renewed life. "In these the second
death hath no power." Therefore it has power in the rest, of
whom he said above, "The rest of them did not live until the
thousand years were finished;" for in this whole intervening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
time, called a thousand years, however lustily they lived in
the body, they were not quickened to life out of that death in
which their wickedness held them, so that by this revived
life they should become partakers of the first resurrection, and
so the second death should have no power over them.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>What is to be replied to those who think that resurrection pertains only to
bodies and not to souls.</i></p>

<p>There are some who suppose that resurrection can be predicated
only of the body, and therefore they contend that this
first resurrection (of the Apocalypse) is a bodily resurrection.
For, say they, "to rise again" can only be said of things that
fall. Now, bodies fall in death.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> There cannot, therefore, be
a resurrection of souls, but of bodies. But what do they say
to the apostle who speaks of a resurrection of souls? For
certainly it was in the inner and not the outer man that those
had risen again to whom he says, "If ye have risen with
Christ, mind the things that are above."<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The same sense he
elsewhere conveyed in other words, saying, "That as Christ
has risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also
may walk in newness of life."<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> So, too, "Awake thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light."<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> As to what they say about nothing being able to
rise again but what falls, whence they conclude that resurrection
pertains to bodies only, and not to souls, because
bodies fall, why do they make nothing of the words, "Ye that
fear the Lord, wait for His mercy; and go not aside lest
ye fall;"<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and "To his own Master he stands or falls;"<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
and "He that thinketh he standeth, let him take heed lest
he fall?"<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> For I fancy this fall that we are to take heed
against is a fall of the soul, not of the body. If, then, rising
again belongs to things that fall, and souls fall, it must be
owned that souls also rise again. To the words, "In them
the second death hath no power," are added the words, "but
they shall be priests of God and Christ, and shall reign with
Him a thousand years;" and this refers not to the bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
alone, and presbyters, who are now specially called priests in
the Church; but as we call all believers Christians on account
of the mystical chrism, so we call all priests because they are
members of the one Priest. Of them the Apostle Peter says,
"A holy people, a royal priesthood."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Certainly he implied,
though in a passing and incidental way, that Christ is God,
saying priests of God and Christ, that is, of the Father and
the Son, though it was in His servant-form and as Son of man
that Christ was made a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
But this we have already explained more than
once.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of Gog and Magog, who are to be roused by the devil to persecute the
Church, when he is loosed in the end of the world.</i></p>

<p>"And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall
be loosed from his prison, and shall go out to seduce the
nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and
Magog, and shall draw them to battle, whose number is as
the sand of the sea." This, then, is his purpose in seducing
them, to draw them to this battle. For even before this he
was wont to use as many and various seductions as he could
continue. And the words "he shall go out" mean, he shall
burst forth from lurking hatred into open persecution. For
this persecution, occurring while the final judgment is imminent,
shall be the last which shall be endured by the holy
Church throughout the world, the whole city of Christ being
assailed by the whole city of the devil, as each exists on
earth. For these nations which he names Gog and Magog
are not to be understood of some barbarous nations in some
part of the world, whether the Getæ and Massagetæ, as some
conclude from the initial letters, or some other foreign nations
not under the Roman government. For John marks that
they are spread over the whole earth, when he says, "The
nations which are in the four corners of the earth," and he
added that these are Gog and Magog. The meaning of these
names we find to be, Gog, "a roof," Magog, "from a roof,"&mdash;a
house, as it were, and he who comes out of the house. They
are therefore the nations in which we found that the devil
was shut up as in an abyss, and the devil himself coming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
from them and going forth, so that they are the roof, he from
the roof. Or if we refer both words to the nations, not one
to them and one to the devil, then they are both the roof,
because in them the old enemy is at present shut up, and as
it were roofed in; and they shall be from the roof when they
break forth from concealed to open hatred. The words, "And
they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encompassed
the camp of the saints and the beloved city," do not mean
that they have come, or shall come, to one place, as if the
camp of the saints and the beloved city should be in some
one place; for this camp is nothing else than the Church of
Christ extending over the whole world. And consequently
wherever the Church shall be,&mdash;and it shall be in all nations,
as is signified by "the breadth of the earth,"&mdash;there also shall
be the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and there it
shall be encompassed by the savage persecution of all its
enemies; for they too shall exist along with it in all nations,&mdash;that
is, it shall be straitened, and hard pressed, and shut
up in the straits of tribulation, but shall not desert its military
duty, which is signified by the word "camp."</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Whether the fire that came down out of heaven and devoured them refers to
the last punishment of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>The words, "And fire came down out of heaven and devoured
them," are not to be understood of the final punishment
which shall be inflicted when it is said, "Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire;"<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> for then they shall be
cast into the fire, not fire come down out of heaven upon
them. In this place "fire out of heaven" is well understood
of the firmness of the saints, wherewith they refuse to yield
obedience to those who rage against them. For the firmament
is "heaven," by whose firmness these assailants shall be
pained with blazing zeal, for they shall be impotent to draw
away the saints to the party of Antichrist. This is the fire
which shall devour them, and this is "from God;" for it
is by God's grace the saints become unconquerable, and so
torment their enemies. For as in a good sense it is said,
"The zeal of Thine house hath consumed me,"<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> so in a bad
sense it is said, "Zeal hath possessed the uninstructed people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
and now fire shall consume the enemies."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> "And now," that
is to say, not the fire of the last judgment. Or if by this fire
coming down out of heaven and consuming them, John meant
that blow wherewith Christ in His coming is to strike those
persecutors of the Church whom He shall then find alive upon
earth, when He shall kill Antichrist with the breath of His
mouth,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> then even this is not the last judgment of the wicked;
but the last judgment is that which they shall suffer when
the bodily resurrection has taken place.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether the time of the persecution of Antichrist should be reckoned in the
thousand years.</i></p>

<p>This last persecution by Antichrist shall last for three years
and six months, as we have already said, and as is affirmed
both in the book of Revelation and by Daniel the prophet.
Though this time is brief, yet not without reason is it questioned
whether it is comprehended in the thousand years in
which the devil is bound and the saints reign with Christ,
or whether this little season should be added over and above
to these years. For if we say that they are included in the
thousand years, then the saints reign with Christ during a
more protracted period than the devil is bound. For they
shall reign with their King and Conqueror mightily even in
that crowning persecution when the devil shall now be unbound
and shall rage against them with all his might. How
then does Scripture define both the binding of the devil and
the reign of the saints by the same thousand years, if the
binding of the devil ceases three years and six months before
this reign of the saints with Christ? On the other hand, if
we say that the brief space of this persecution is not to be
reckoned as a part of the thousand years, but rather as an
additional period, we shall indeed be able to interpret the
words, "The priests of God and of Christ shall reign with
Him a thousand years; and when the thousand years shall be
finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;" for thus they
signify that the reign of the saints and the bondage of the
devil shall cease simultaneously, so that the time of the persecution
we speak of should be contemporaneous neither with
the reign of the saints nor with the imprisonment of Satan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
but should be reckoned over and above as a superadded portion
of time. But then in this case we are forced to admit that
the saints shall not reign with Christ during that persecution.
But who can dare to say that His members shall not reign
with Him at that very juncture when they shall most of all,
and with the greatest fortitude, cleave to Him, and when the
glory of resistance and the crown of martyrdom shall be more
conspicuous in proportion to the hotness of the battle? Or
if it is suggested that they may be said not to reign, because
of the tribulations which they shall suffer, it will follow that
all the saints who have formerly, during the thousand years,
suffered tribulation, shall not be said to have reigned with
Christ during the period of their tribulation, and consequently
even those whose souls the author of this book says that
he saw, and who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and
the word of God, did not reign with Christ when they were
suffering persecution, and they were not themselves the kingdom
of Christ, though Christ was then pre-eminently possessing
them. This is indeed perfectly absurd, and to be scouted.
But assuredly the victorious souls of the glorious martyrs,
having overcome and finished all griefs and toils, and having
laid down their mortal members, have reigned, and do reign,
with Christ till the thousand years are finished, that they
may afterwards reign with Him when they have received
their immortal bodies. And therefore during these three
years and a half the souls of those who were slain for His
testimony, both those which formerly passed from the body
and those which shall pass in that last persecution, shall
reign with Him till the mortal world come to an end, and
pass into that kingdom in which there shall be no death.
And thus the reign of the saints with Christ shall last longer
than the bonds and imprisonment of the devil, because they
shall reign with their King the Son of God for these three
years and a half during which the devil is no longer bound.
It remains, therefore, that when we read that "the priests of
God and of Christ shall reign with Him a thousand years;
and when the thousand years are finished, the devil shall be
loosed from his imprisonment," that we understand either
that the thousand years of the reign of the saints does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
terminate, though the imprisonment of the devil does,&mdash;so that
both parties have their thousand years, that is, their complete
time, yet each with a different actual duration appropriate to
itself, the kingdom of the saints being longer, the imprisonment
of the devil shorter,&mdash;or at least that, as three years and
six months is a very short time, it is not reckoned as either
deducted from the whole time of Satan's imprisonment, or as
added to the whole duration of the reign of the saints, as we
have shown above in the sixteenth book<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> regarding the round
number of four hundred years, which were specified as four
hundred, though actually somewhat more; and similar expressions
are often found in the sacred writings, if one will
mark them.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>14. <i>Of the damnation of the devil and his adherents; and a sketch of the bodily
resurrection of all the dead, and of the final retributive judgment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After this mention of the closing persecution, he summarily
indicates all that the devil, and the city of which he is the
prince, shall suffer in the last judgment. For he says, "And
the devil who seduced them is cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, in which are the beast and the false prophet, and
they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
We have already said that by the beast is well understood
the wicked city. His false prophet is either Antichrist or
that image or figment of which we have spoken in the same
place. After this he gives a brief narrative of the last judgment
itself, which shall take place at the second or bodily
resurrection of the dead, as it had been revealed to him: "I
saw a throne great and white, and One sitting on it from
whose face the heaven and the earth fled away, and their
place was not found." He does not say, "I saw a throne
great and white, and One sitting on it, and from His face the
heaven and the earth fled away," for it had not happened
then, <i>i.e.</i> before the living and the dead were judged; but he
says that he saw Him sitting on the throne from whose face
heaven and earth fled away, but afterwards. For when the
judgment is finished, this heaven and earth shall cease to be,
and there will be a new heaven and a new earth. For this
world shall pass away by transmutation, not by absolute destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
And therefore the apostle says, "For the figure
of this world passeth away. I would have you be without
anxiety."<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The figure, therefore, passes away, not the nature.
After John had said that he had seen One sitting on the
throne from whose face heaven and earth fled, though not till
afterwards, he said, "And I saw the dead, great and small:
and the books were opened; and another book was opened,
which is the book of the life of each man: and the dead were
judged out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their deeds." He said that the books were
opened, and a book; but he left us at a loss as to the nature
of this book, "which is," he says, "the book of the life of each
man." By those books, then, which he first mentioned, we
are to understand the sacred books old and new, that out of
them it might be shown what commandments God had enjoined;
and that book of the life of each man is to show what
commandments each man has done or omitted to do. If this
book be materially considered, who can reckon its size or
length, or the time it would take to read a book in which
the whole life of every man is recorded? Shall there be present
as many angels as men, and shall each man hear his life
recited by the angel assigned to him? In that case there
will be not one book containing all the lives, but a separate
book for every life. But our passage requires us to think of
one only. "And another book was opened," it says. We must
therefore understand it of a certain divine power, by which it
shall be brought about that every one shall recall to memory
all his own works, whether good or evil, and shall mentally
survey them with a marvellous rapidity, so that this knowledge
will either accuse or excuse conscience, and thus all and
each shall be simultaneously judged. And this divine power
is called a book, because in it we shall as it were read all that
it causes us to remember. That he may show who the dead,
small and great, are who are to be judged, he recurs to this
which he had omitted or rather deferred, and says, "And the
sea presented the dead which were in it; and death and hell
gave up the dead which were in them." This of course took
place before the dead were judged, yet it is mentioned after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
And so, I say, he returns again to what he had omitted. But
now he preserves the order of events, and for the sake of
exhibiting it repeats in its own proper place what he had
already said regarding the dead who were judged. For after
he had said, "And the sea presented the dead which were in
it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them,"
he immediately subjoined what he had already said, "and
they were judged every man according to their works." For
this is just what he had said before, "And the dead were
judged according to their works."</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Who the dead are who are given up to judgment by the sea, and by death
and hell.</i></p>

<p>But who are the dead which were in the sea, and which the
sea presented? For we cannot suppose that those who die in
the sea are not in hell, nor that their bodies are preserved in
the sea; nor yet, which is still more absurd, that the sea retained
the good, while hell received the bad. Who could
believe this? But some very sensibly suppose that in this
place the sea is put for this world. When John then wished
to signify that those whom Christ should find still alive in the
body were to be judged along with those who should rise
again, he called them dead, both the good to whom it is said,
"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God,"<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
and the wicked of whom it is said, "Let the dead bury their
dead."<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> They may also be called dead, because they wear
mortal bodies, as the apostle says, "The body indeed is dead
because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness;"<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
proving that in a living man in the body there is both a body
which is dead, and a spirit which is life. Yet he did not say
that the body was mortal, but dead, although immediately
after he speaks in the more usual way of mortal bodies.
These, then, are the dead which were in the sea, and which
the sea presented, to wit, the men who were in this world,
because they had not yet died, and whom the world presented
for judgment. "And death and hell," he says, "gave up the
dead which were in them." The sea <i>presented</i> them because
they had merely to be found in the place where they were;
but death and hell <i>gave them up</i> or <i>restored</i> them, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
called them back to life, which they had already quitted.
And perhaps it was not without reason that neither <i>death</i> nor
<i>hell</i> were judged sufficient alone, and both were mentioned,&mdash;death
to indicate the good, who have suffered only death and
not hell; hell to indicate the wicked, who suffer also the
punishment of hell. For if it does not seem absurd to believe
that the ancient saints who believed in Christ and His then
future coming, were kept in places far removed indeed from
the torments of the wicked, but yet in hell,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> until Christ's
blood and His descent into these places delivered them, certainly
good Christians, redeemed by that precious price already
paid, are quite unacquainted with hell while they wait for
their restoration to the body, and the reception of their reward.
After saying, "They were judged every man according
to their works," he briefly added what the judgment was:
"Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire;" by these
names designating the devil and the whole company of his
angels, for he is the author of death and the pains of hell.
For this is what he had already, by anticipation, said in clearer
language: "The devil who seduced them was cast into a lake
of fire and brimstone." The obscure addition he had made
in the words, "in which were also the beast and the false
prophet," he here explains, "They who were not found written
in the book of life were cast into the lake of fire." This book
is not for reminding God, as if things might escape Him by
forgetfulness, but it symbolizes His predestination of those to
whom eternal life shall be given. For it is not that God is
ignorant, and reads in the book to inform Himself, but rather
His infallible prescience is the book of life in which they are
written, that is to say, known beforehand.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the new heaven and the new earth.</i></p>

<p>Having finished the prophecy of judgment, so far as the
wicked are concerned, it remains that he speak also of the
good. Having briefly explained the Lord's words, "These will
go away into everlasting punishment," it remains that he explain
the connected words, "but the righteous into life eternal."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
"And I saw," he says, "a new heaven and a new earth: for
the first heaven and the first earth have passed away; and
there is no more sea."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> This will take place in the order
which he has by anticipation declared in the words, "I saw
One sitting on the throne, from whose face heaven and earth
fled." For as soon as those who are not written in the book
of life have been judged and cast into eternal fire,&mdash;the nature
of which fire, or its position in the world or universe, I suppose
is known to no man, unless perhaps the divine Spirit
reveal it to some one,&mdash;then shall the figure of this world pass
away in a conflagration of universal fire, as once before the
world was flooded with a deluge of universal water. And by
this universal conflagration the qualities of the corruptible
elements which suited our corruptible bodies shall utterly
perish, and our substance shall receive such qualities as shall,
by a wonderful transmutation, harmonize with our immortal
bodies, so that, as the world itself is renewed to some better
thing, it is fitly accommodated to men, themselves renewed in
their flesh to some better thing. As for the statement, "And
there shall be no more sea," I would not lightly say whether
it is dried up with that excessive heat, or is itself also turned
into some better thing. For we read that there shall be a
new heaven and a new earth, but I do not remember to have
anywhere read anything of a new sea, unless what I find in
this same book, "As it were a sea of glass like crystal."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> But
he was not then speaking of this end of the world, neither
does he seem to speak of a literal sea, but "as it were a sea."
It is possible that, as prophetic diction delights in mingling
figurative and real language, and thus in some sort veiling the
sense, so the words "And there is no more sea" may be taken
in the same sense as the previous phrase, "And the sea presented
the dead which were in it." For then there shall be
no more of this world, no more of the surgings and restlessness
of human life, and it is this which is symbolized by the
<i>sea</i>.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the endless glory of the Church.</i></p>

<p>"And I saw," he says, "a great city, new Jerusalem, coming
down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
for her husband. And I heard a great voice from the throne,
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God
Himself shall be with them. And God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, but neither shall there be any
more pain: because the former things have passed away. And
He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new."<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> This city is said to come down out of heaven, because
the grace with which God formed it is of heaven.
Wherefore He says to it by Isaiah, "I am the Lord that
formed thee."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> It is indeed descended from heaven from its
commencement, since its citizens during the course of this
world grow by the grace of God, which cometh down from
above through the laver of regeneration in the Holy Ghost
sent down from heaven. But by God's final judgment, which
shall be administered by His Son Jesus Christ, there shall by
God's grace be manifested a glory so pervading and so new,
that no vestige of what is old shall remain; for even our
bodies shall pass from their old corruption and mortality to
new incorruption and immortality. For to refer this promise
to the present time, in which the saints are reigning with their
King a thousand years, seems to me excessively barefaced,
when it is most distinctly said, "God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, but there shall be no more pain."
And who is so absurd, and blinded by contentious opinionativeness,
as to be audacious enough to affirm that in the
midst of the calamities of this mortal state, God's people, or
even one single saint, does live, or has ever lived, or shall ever
live, without tears or pain,&mdash;the fact being that the holier a
man is, and the fuller of holy desire, so much the more abundant
is the tearfulness of his supplication? Are not these
the utterances of a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem: "My
tears have been my meat day and night;"<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and "Every night
shall I make my bed to swim; with my tears shall I water
my couch;"<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> and "My groaning is not hid from Thee;"<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
"My sorrow was renewed?"<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Or are not those God's children

no more death in that city, except when it shall be said, "O
death, where is thy contention?<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> O death, where is thy sting?

it is not some poor weak citizen of this city, but this same
Apostle John himself who says, "If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> No
doubt, though this book is called the Apocalypse, there are in
it many obscure passages to exercise the mind of the reader,
and there are few passages so plain as to assist us in the
interpretation of the others, even though we take pains; and
this difficulty is increased by the repetition of the same things,
in forms so different, that the things referred to seem to be
different, although in fact they are only differently stated.
But in the words, "God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
crying, but there shall be no more pain," there is so manifest
a reference to the future world and the immortality and
eternity of the saints,&mdash;for only then and only there shall
such a condition be realized,&mdash;that if we think this obscure,
we need not expect to find anything plain in any part of
Scripture.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>What the Apostle Peter predicted regarding the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see what the Apostle Peter predicted concerning
this judgment. "There shall come," he says, "in the last
days scoffers.... Nevertheless we, according to His promise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> There is nothing said here about the resurrection
of the dead, but enough certainly regarding the destruction
of this world. And by his reference to the deluge
he seems as it were to suggest to us how far we should believe
the ruin of the world will extend in the end of the
world. For he says that the world which then was perished,
and not only the earth itself, but also the heavens, by which
we understand the air, the place and room of which was
occupied by the water. Therefore the whole, or almost the
whole, of the gusty atmosphere (which he calls heaven, or
rather the heavens, meaning the earth's atmosphere, and not
the upper air in which sun, moon, and stars are set) was
turned into moisture, and in this way perished together with
the earth, whose former appearance had been destroyed by the
deluge. "But the heavens and the earth which are now, by
the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the
day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." Therefore
the heavens and the earth, or the world which was preserved
from the water to stand in place of that world which perished
in the flood, is itself reserved to fire at last in the day of the
judgment and perdition of ungodly men. He does not hesitate
to affirm that in this great change men also shall perish: their
nature, however, shall notwithstanding continue, though in
eternal punishments. Some one will perhaps put the question,
If after judgment is pronounced the world itself is to burn,
where shall the saints be during the conflagration, and before
it is replaced by a new heavens and a new earth, since somewhere
they must be, because they have material bodies? We
may reply that they shall be in the upper regions into which
the flame of that conflagration shall not ascend, as neither did
the water of the flood; for they shall have such bodies that
they shall be wherever they wish. Moreover, when they have
become immortal and incorruptible, they shall not greatly dread
the blaze of that conflagration, as the corruptible and mortal
bodies of the three men were able to live unhurt in the blazing
furnace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">19. <i>What the Apostle Paul wrote to the Thessalonians about the manifestation
of Antichrist which shall precede the day of the Lord.</i></p>

<p>I see that I must omit many of the statements of the
gospels and epistles about this last judgment, that this volume
may not become unduly long; but I can on no account omit
what the Apostle Paul says, in writing to the Thessalonians,
"We beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> etc.</p>

<p>No one can doubt that he wrote this of Antichrist and of
the day of judgment, which he here calls the day of the Lord,
nor that he declared that this day should not come unless he
first came who is called the apostate&mdash;apostate, to wit, from
the Lord God. And if this may justly be said of all the ungodly,
how much more of him? But it is uncertain in what
temple he shall sit, whether in that ruin of the temple which
was built by Solomon, or in the Church; for the apostle
would not call the temple of any idol or demon the temple of
God. And on this account some think that in this passage
Antichrist means not the prince himself alone, but his whole
body, that is, the mass of men who adhere to him, along with
him their prince; and they also think that we should render
the Greek more exactly were we to read, not "in the temple
of God," but "for" or "as the temple of God," as if he himself
were the temple of God, the Church.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Then as for the
words, "And now ye know what withholdeth," <i>i.e.</i> ye know
what hindrance or cause of delay there is, "that he might be
revealed in his own time;" they show that he was unwilling
to make an explicit statement, because he said that they knew.
And thus we who have not their knowledge wish and are
not able even with pains to understand what the apostle referred
to, especially as his meaning is made still more obscure
by what he adds. For what does he mean by "For the
mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way: and
then shall the wicked be revealed?" I frankly confess I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
not know what he means. I will nevertheless mention such
conjectures as I have heard or read.</p>

<p>Some think that the Apostle Paul referred to the Roman
empire, and that he was unwilling to use language more explicit,
lest he should incur the calumnious charge of wishing
ill to the empire which it was hoped would be eternal; so
that in saying, "For the mystery of iniquity doth already
work," he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be
as the deeds of Antichrist. And hence some suppose that he
shall rise again and be Antichrist. Others, again, suppose that
he is not even dead, but that he was concealed that he might
be supposed to have been killed, and that he now lives in
concealment in the vigour of that same age which he had
reached when he was believed to have perished, and will live
until he is revealed in his own time and restored to his kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
But I wonder that men can be so audacious in their
conjectures. However, it is not absurd to believe that these
words of the apostle, "Only he who now holdeth, let him hold
until he be taken out of the way," refer to the Roman empire,
as if it were said, "Only he who now reigneth, let him reign
until he be taken out of the way." "And then shall the
wicked be revealed:" no one doubts that this means Antichrist.
But others think that the words, "Ye know what
withholdeth," and "The mystery of iniquity worketh," refer
only to the wicked and the hypocrites who are in the Church,
until they reach a number so great as to furnish Antichrist
with a great people, and that this is the <i>mystery</i> of iniquity,
because it seems hidden; also that the apostle is exhorting
the faithful tenaciously to hold the faith they hold when he
says, "Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be
taken out of the way," that is, until the mystery of iniquity
which now is hidden departs from the Church. For they
suppose that it is to this same mystery John alludes when in
his epistle he says, "Little children, it is the last time: and
as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are
there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last
time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for
if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
with us."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> As therefore there went out from the Church
many heretics, whom John calls "many antichrists," at that
time prior to the end, and which John calls "the last time,"
so in the end they shall go out who do not belong to Christ,
but to that last Antichrist, and then he shall be revealed.</p>

<p>Thus various, then, are the conjectural explanations of the
obscure words of the apostle. That which there is no doubt
he said is this, that Christ will not come to judge quick and
dead unless Antichrist, His adversary, first come to seduce
those who are dead in soul; although their seduction is a result
of God's secret judgment already passed. For, as it is
said, "his presence shall be after the working of Satan, with
all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all seduction
of unrighteousness in them that perish." For then shall
Satan be loosed, and by means of that Antichrist shall work
with all power in a lying though a wonderful manner. It is
commonly questioned whether these works are called "signs
and lying wonders" because he is to deceive men's senses by
false appearances, or because the things he does, though they
be true prodigies, shall be a lie to those who shall believe
that such things could be done only by God, being ignorant
of the devil's power, and especially of such unexampled power
as he shall then for the first time put forth. For when he
fell from heaven as fire, and at a stroke swept away from the
holy Job his numerous household and his vast flocks, and
then as a whirlwind rushed upon and smote the house and
killed his children, these were not deceitful appearances, and
yet they were the works of Satan to whom God had given
this power. Why they are called signs and lying wonders
we shall then be more likely to know when the time itself
arrives. But whatever be the reason of the name, they shall
be such signs and wonders as shall seduce those who shall
deserve to be seduced, "because they received not the love of
the truth that they might be saved." Neither did the apostle
scruple to go on to say, "For this cause God shall send upon
them the working of error that they should believe a lie."
For God shall <i>send</i>, because God shall permit the devil to do
these things, the permission being by His own just judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
though the doing of them is in pursuance of the devil's unrighteous
and malignant purpose, "that they all might be
judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
Therefore, being judged, they shall be seduced,
and, being seduced, they shall be judged. But, being judged,
they shall be seduced by those secretly just and justly secret
judgments of God, with which He has never ceased to judge
since the first sin of the rational creatures; and, being seduced,
they shall be judged in that last and manifest judgment administered
by Jesus Christ, who was Himself most unjustly
judged and shall most justly judge.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>What the same apostle taught in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians
regarding the resurrection of the dead.</i></p>

<p>But the apostle has said nothing here regarding the resurrection
of the dead; but in his first Epistle to the Thessalonians
he says, "We would not have you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning them which are asleep,"<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> etc. These
words of the apostle most distinctly proclaim the future resurrection
of the dead, when the Lord Christ shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.</p>

<p>But it is commonly asked whether those whom our Lord
shall find alive upon earth, personated in this passage by the
apostle and those who were alive with him, shall never die
at all, or shall pass with incomprehensible swiftness through
death to immortality in the very moment during which they
shall be caught up along with those who rise again to meet
the Lord in the air? For we cannot say that it is impossible
that they should both die and revive again while they are
carried aloft through the air. For the words, "And so shall
we ever be with the Lord," are not to be understood as if he
meant that we shall always remain in the air with the Lord;
for He Himself shall not remain there, but shall only pass
through it as He comes. For we shall go to meet Him as
He comes, not where He remains; but "so shall we be with
the Lord," that is, we shall be with Him possessed of immortal
bodies wherever we shall be with Him. We seem
compelled to take the words in this sense, and to suppose that
those whom the Lord shall find alive upon earth shall in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
brief space both suffer death and receive immortality; for this
same apostle says, "In Christ shall all be made alive;"<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> while,
speaking of the same resurrection of the body, he elsewhere
says, "That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
die."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> How, then, shall those whom Christ shall find alive
upon earth be made alive to immortality in Him if they die
not, since on this very account it is said, "That which thou
sowest is not quickened, except it die?" Or if we cannot
properly speak of human bodies as sown, unless in so far as
by dying they do in some sort return to the earth, as also the
sentence pronounced by God against the sinning father of the
human race runs, "Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou
return,"<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> we must acknowledge that those whom Christ at
His coming shall find still in the body are not included in
these words of the apostle nor in those of Genesis; for, being
caught up into the clouds, they are certainly not sown, neither
going nor returning to the earth, whether they experience no
death at all or die for a moment in the air.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, there meets us the saying of the
same apostle when he was speaking to the Corinthians about
the resurrection of the body, "We shall all rise," or, as other
<span class="smcap">mss.</span> read, "We shall all sleep."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Since, then, there can be
no resurrection unless death has preceded, and since we can
in this passage understand by sleep nothing else than death,
how shall <i>all</i> either sleep or rise again if so many persons
whom Christ shall find in the body shall neither sleep nor
rise again? If, then, we believe that the saints who shall
be found alive at Christ's coming, and shall be caught up to
meet Him, shall in that same ascent pass from mortal to immortal
bodies, we shall find no difficulty in the words of the
apostle, either when he says, "That which thou sowest is
not quickened, except it die," or when he says, "We shall all
rise," or "all sleep," for not even the saints shall be quickened
to immortality unless they first die, however briefly;
and consequently they shall not be exempt from resurrection
which is preceded by sleep, however brief. And why should
it seem to us incredible that that multitude of bodies should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
be, as it were, sown in the air, and should in the air forthwith
revive immortal and incorruptible, when we believe, on the
testimony of the same apostle, that the resurrection shall take
place in the twinkling of an eye, and that the dust of bodies
long dead shall return with incomprehensible facility and
swiftness to those members that are now to live endlessly?
Neither do we suppose that in the case of these saints the
sentence, "Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,"
is null, though their bodies do not, on dying, fall to earth, but
both die and rise again at once while caught up into the air.
For "Thou shalt return to earth" means, Thou shalt at death
return to that which thou wert before life began. Thou
shalt, when exanimate, be that which thou wert before thou
wast animate. For it was into a face of earth that God
breathed the breath of life when man was made a living
soul; as if it were said, Thou art earth with a soul, which
thou wast not; thou shalt be earth without a soul, as thou
wast. And this is what all bodies of the dead are before
they rot; and what the bodies of those saints shall be if they
die, no matter where they die, as soon as they shall give up
that life which they are immediately to receive back again.
In this way, then, they return or go to earth, inasmuch as
from being living men they shall be earth, as that which becomes
cinder is said to go to cinder; that which decays, to
go to decay; and so of six hundred other things. But the
manner in which this shall take place we can now only feebly
conjecture, and shall understand it only when it comes to
pass. For that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the
dead when Christ comes to judge quick and dead, we must
believe if we would be Christians. But if we are unable
perfectly to comprehend the manner in which it shall take
place, our faith is not on this account vain. Now, however,
we ought, as we formerly promised, to show, as far as seems
necessary, what the ancient prophetic books predicted concerning
this final judgment of God; and I fancy no great
time need be spent in discussing and explaining these predictions,
if the reader has been careful to avail himself of the
help we have already furnished.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="chap21"></a>21. <i>Utterances of the prophet Isaiah regarding the resurrection of the dead and
the retributive judgment.</i></p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah says, "The dead shall rise again, and
all who were in the graves shall rise again; and all who are
in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is
their health, and the earth of the wicked shall fall."<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> All
the former part of this passage relates to the resurrection of
the blessed; but the words, "the earth of the wicked shall
fall," is rightly understood as meaning that the bodies of the
wicked shall fall into the ruin of damnation. And if we
would more exactly and carefully scrutinize the words which
refer to the resurrection of the good, we may refer to the first
resurrection the words, "the dead shall rise again," and to
the second the following words, "and all who were in the
graves shall rise again." And if we ask what relates to those
saints whom the Lord at His coming shall find alive upon
earth, the following clause may suitably be referred to them:
"All who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is
from Thee is their health." By "health" in this place it is
best to understand immortality. For that is the most perfect
health which is not repaired by nourishment as by a daily
remedy. In like manner the same prophet, affording hope to
the good and terrifying the wicked regarding the day of judgment,
says, "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will flow down
upon them as a river of peace, and upon the glory of the
Gentiles as a rushing torrent: their sons shall be carried on
the shoulders, and shall be comforted on the knees. As one
whom his mother comforteth, so shall I comfort you; and ye
shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And ye shall see, and your
heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall rise up like a herb;
and the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers,
and He shall threaten the contumacious. For, behold, the
Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to
execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame
of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be
judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded
by the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> In His promise to the good he says that He
will flow down as a river of peace, that is to say, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
greatest possible abundance of peace. With this peace we
shall in the end be refreshed; but of this we have spoken
abundantly in the preceding book. It is this river in which
he says He shall flow down upon those to whom He promises
so great happiness, that we may understand that in the
region of that felicity, which is in heaven, all things are
satisfied from this river. But because there shall thence flow,
even upon earthly bodies, the peace of incorruption and immortality,
therefore he says that He shall flow down as this
river, that He may as it were pour Himself from things above
to things beneath, and make men the equals of the angels.
By "Jerusalem," too, we should understand not that which
serves with her children, but that which, according to the
apostle, is our free mother, eternal in the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> In her
we shall be comforted as we pass toilworn from earth's cares
and calamities, and be taken up as her children on her knees
and shoulders. Inexperienced and new to such blandishments,
we shall be received into unwonted bliss. There we
shall see, and our heart shall rejoice. He does not say what
we shall see; but what but God, that the promise in the
Gospel may be fulfilled in us, "Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God?"<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> What shall we see but all those
things which now we see not, but believe in, and of which
the idea we form, according to our feeble capacity, is incomparably
less than the reality? "And ye shall see," he says,
"and your heart shall rejoice." Here ye believe, there ye
shall see.</p>

<p>But because he said, "Your heart shall rejoice," lest we
should suppose that the blessings of that Jerusalem are only
spiritual, he adds, "And your bones shall rise up like a herb,"
alluding to the resurrection of the body, and as it were supplying
an omission he had made. For it will not take place
when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken
place. For he had already spoken of the new heavens and
the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures,
of the things promised to the saints, and saying, "There shall
be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be
remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an
exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem,
and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall
be no more heard in her;"<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> and other promises, which some
endeavour to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand
years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal
expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful
and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal
sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined
mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is
nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough
regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted.
And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said,
"And your bones shall rise up like a herb," in order to show
that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily
resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, "And the hand
of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers." What is
this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship
from those who despise Him? Regarding these the
context immediately adds, "And He shall threaten the contumacious,"
or, as another translator has it, "the unbelieving."
He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which
are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. "For behold,"
he says, "the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind
His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and
wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall
all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many
shall be wounded by the Lord." By <i>fire</i>, <i>whirlwind</i>, <i>sword</i>,
he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that
the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say,
to whom His coming shall be penal. By His <i>chariots</i> (for the
word is plural) we suitably understand the ministration of
angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth
shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand
the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly
and carnal, of whom it is said that they "mind earthly
things,"<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> and "to be carnally minded is death,"<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> and whom
the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, "My Spirit shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
not always remain in these men, for they are flesh."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> As
to the words, "Many shall be wounded by the Lord," this
wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible,
indeed, to understand <i>fire</i>, <i>sword</i>, and <i>wound</i> in a good sense.
For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the
Holy Spirit came.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> And our Lord says, "I am not come to
send peace on earth, but a sword."<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> And Scripture says that
the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> on account of the
two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs
the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>&mdash;pierced,
as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read
or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is
obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.</p>

<p>After briefly mentioning those who shall be consumed in
this judgment, speaking of the wicked and sinners under the
figure of the meats forbidden by the old law, from which they
had not abstained, he summarily recounts the grace of the
new testament, from the first coming of the Saviour to the
last judgment, of which we now speak; and herewith he concludes
his prophecy. For he relates that the Lord declares
that He is coming to gather all nations, that they may come
and witness His glory.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> For, as the apostle says, "All have
sinned and are in want of the glory of God."<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> And he says
that He will do wonders among them, at which they shall
marvel and believe in Him; and that from them He will send
forth those that are saved into various nations, and distant
islands which have not heard His name nor seen His glory,
and that they shall declare His glory among the nations, and
shall <i>bring</i> the brethren of those to whom the prophet was
speaking, <i>i.e.</i> shall bring to the faith under God the Father
the brethren of the elect Israelites; and that they shall bring
from all nations an offering to the Lord on beasts of burden
and waggons (which are understood to mean the aids furnished
by God in the shape of angelic or human ministry), to the
holy city Jerusalem, which at present is scattered over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
earth, in the faithful saints. For where divine aid is given,
men believe, and where they believe, they come. And the
Lord compared them, in a figure, to the children of Israel
offering sacrifice to Him in His house with psalms, which is
already everywhere done by the Church; and He promised
that from among them He would choose for Himself priests
and Levites, which also we see already accomplished. For
we see that priests and Levites are now chosen, not from a
certain family and blood, as was originally the rule in the
priesthood according to the order of Aaron, but as befits the
new testament, under which Christ is the High Priest after
the order of Melchisedec, in consideration of the merit which
is bestowed upon each man by divine grace. And these priests
are not to be judged by their mere title, which is often borne
by unworthy men, but by that holiness which is not common
to good men and bad.</p>

<p>After having thus spoken of this mercy of God which is
now experienced by the Church, and is very evident and
familiar to us, he foretells also the ends to which men shall
come when the last judgment has separated the good and the
bad, saying by the prophet, or the prophet himself speaking
for God, "For as the new heavens and the new earth shall
remain before me, said the Lord, so shall your seed and your
name remain, and there shall be to them month after month,
and Sabbath after Sabbath. All flesh shall come to worship
before me in Jerusalem, said the Lord. And they shall go
out, and shall see the members of the men who have sinned
against me: their worm shall not die, neither shall their
fire be quenched; and they shall be for a spectacle to all
flesh."<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> At this point the prophet closed his book, as at
this point the world shall come to an end. Some, indeed,
have translated "carcases"<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> instead of "members of the men,"
meaning by <i>carcases</i> the manifest punishment of the body,
although <i>carcase</i> is commonly used only of dead flesh, while
the bodies here spoken of shall be animated, else they could
not be sensible of any pain; but perhaps they may, without
absurdity, be called carcases, as being the bodies of those who
are to fall into the second death. And for the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
it is said, as I have already quoted, by this same prophet,
"The earth of the wicked shall fall."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> It is obvious that
those translators who use a different word for <i>men</i> do not
mean to include only males, for no one will say that the
women who sinned shall not appear in that judgment; but
the male sex, being the more worthy, and that from which
the woman was derived, is intended to include both sexes.
But that which is especially pertinent to our subject is this,
that since the words "All flesh shall come" apply to the good,
for the people of God shall be composed of every race of men,&mdash;for
all men shall not be present, since the greater part
shall be in punishment,&mdash;but, as I was saying, since <i>flesh</i> is
used of the good, and <i>members</i> or <i>carcases</i> of the bad, certainly
it is thus put beyond a doubt that that judgment in which
the good and the bad shall be allotted to their destinies shall
take place after the resurrection of the body, our faith in
which is thoroughly established by the use of these words.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>What is meant by the good going out to see the punishment of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>But in what way shall the good go out to see the punishment
of the wicked? Are they to leave their happy abodes
by a bodily movement, and proceed to the places of punishment,
so as to witness the torments of the wicked in their
bodily presence? Certainly not; but they shall go out by
knowledge. For this expression, <i>go out</i>, signifies that those
who shall be punished shall be without. And thus the Lord
also calls these places "the outer darkness,"<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> to which is
opposed that entrance concerning which it is said to the
good servant, "Enter into the joy of thy Lord," that it may
not be supposed that the wicked can enter thither and be
known, but rather that the good by their knowledge go out
to them, because the good are to know that which is without.
For those who shall be in torment shall not know what is
going on within in the joy of the Lord; but they who shall
enter into that joy shall know what is going on outside in
the outer darkness. Therefore it is said, "They shall go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
out," because they shall know what is done by those who are
without. For if the prophets were able to know things that
had not yet happened, by means of that indwelling of God in
their minds, limited though it was, shall not the immortal
saints know things that have already happened, when God
shall be all in all?<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> The seed, then, and the name of the
saints shall remain in that blessedness,&mdash;the seed, to wit, of
which John says, "And his seed remaineth in him;"<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> and the
name, of which it was said through Isaiah himself, "I will
give them an everlasting name."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> "And there shall be to
them month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath," as if it
were said, Moon after moon, and rest upon rest, both of which
they shall themselves be when they shall pass from the old
shadows of time into the new lights of eternity. The worm
that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched, which constitute
the punishment of the wicked, are differently interpreted
by different people. For some refer both to the body,
others refer both to the soul; while others again refer the fire
literally to the body, and the worm figuratively to the soul,
which seems the more credible idea. But the present is not
the time to discuss this difference, for we have undertaken to
occupy this book with the last judgment, in which the good
and the bad are separated: their rewards and punishments we
shall more carefully discuss elsewhere.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>What Daniel predicted regarding the persecution of Antichrist, the
judgment of God, and the kingdom of the saints.</i></p>

<p>Daniel prophesies of the last judgment in such a way as to
indicate that Antichrist shall first come, and to carry on his
description to the eternal reign of the saints. For when in
prophetic vision he had seen four beasts, signifying four kingdoms,
and the fourth conquered by a certain king, who is
recognised as Antichrist, and after this the eternal kingdom
of the Son of man, that is to say, of Christ, he says, "My
spirit was terrified, I Daniel in the midst of my body, and
the visions of my head troubled me,"<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> etc. Some have interpreted
these four kingdoms as signifying those of the Assyrians,
Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. They who desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
understand the fitness of this interpretation may read Jerome's
book on Daniel, which is written with a sufficiency of care
and erudition. But he who reads this passage, even half-asleep,
cannot fail to see that the kingdom of Antichrist shall
fiercely, though for a short time, assail the Church before the
last judgment of God shall introduce the eternal reign of the
saints. For it is patent from the context that the <i>time</i>, <i>times</i>,
<i>and half a time</i>, means a year, and two years, and half a year,
that is to say, three years and a half. Sometimes in Scripture
the same thing is indicated by months. For though the word
<i>times</i> seems to be used here in the Latin indefinitely, that is
only because the Latins have no dual, as the Greeks have,
and as the Hebrews also are said to have. Times, therefore, is
used for two times. As for the ten kings, whom, as it seems,
Antichrist is to find in the person of ten individuals when he
comes, I own I am afraid we may be deceived in this, and
that he may come unexpectedly while there are not ten kings
living in the Roman world. For what if this number ten
signifies the whole number of kings who are to precede his
coming, as totality is frequently symbolized by a thousand,
or a hundred, or seven, or other numbers, which it is not
necessary to recount?</p>

<p>In another place the same Daniel says, "And there shall
be a time of trouble, such as was not since there was born a
nation upon earth until that time: and in that time all Thy
people which shall be found written in the book shall be delivered.
And many of them that sleep in the mound of
earth shall arise, some to everlasting life, and some to shame
and everlasting confusion. And they that be wise shall shine
as the brightness of the firmament; and many of the just as
the stars for ever."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> This passage is very similar to the one
we have quoted from the Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> at least so far as regards the
resurrection of dead bodies. For those who are there said to
be "in the graves" are here spoken of as "sleeping in the
mound of earth," or, as others translate, "in the dust of
earth." There it is said, "They shall come forth;" so here,
"They shall arise." There, "They that have done good, to the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of judgment;" here, "Some to everlasting life, and
some to shame and everlasting confusion." Neither is it to
be supposed a difference, though in place of the expression
in the Gospel, "All who are in their graves," the prophet does
not say "all," but "many of them that sleep in the mound of
earth." For <i>many</i> is sometimes used in Scripture for <i>all</i>.
Thus it was said to Abraham, "I have set thee as the father
of many nations," though in another place it was said to him,
"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Of such a resurrection
it is said a little afterwards to the prophet himself,
"And come thou and rest: for there is yet a day till the
completion of the consummation; and thou shalt rest, and
rise in thy lot in the end of the days."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Passages from the Psalms of David which predict the end of the world and
the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>There are many allusions to the last judgment in the
Psalms, but for the most part only casual and slight. I cannot,
however, omit to mention what is said there in express
terms of the end of this world: "In the beginning hast Thou
laid the foundations of the earth, O Lord; and the heavens
are the work of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou
shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
and as a vesture Thou shalt change them, and they shall be
changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not
fail."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Why is it that Porphyry, while he lauds the piety of
the Hebrews in worshipping a God great and true, and terrible
to the gods themselves, follows the oracles of these gods in
accusing the Christians of extreme folly because they say that
this world shall perish? For here we find it said in the
sacred books of the Hebrews, to that God whom this great
philosopher acknowledges to be terrible even to the gods
themselves, "The heavens are the work of Thy hands: they
shall perish." When the heavens, the higher and more secure
part of the world, perish, shall the world itself be preserved?
If this idea is not relished by Jupiter, whose oracle is quoted
by this philosopher as an unquestionable authority in rebuke
of the credulity of the Christians, why does he not similarly
rebuke the wisdom of the Hebrews as folly, seeing that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
prediction is found in their most holy books? But if this
Hebrew wisdom, with which Porphyry is so captivated that
he extols it through the utterances of his own gods, proclaims
that the heavens are to perish, how is he so infatuated as to
detest the faith of the Christians partly, if not chiefly, on this
account, that they believe the world is to perish?&mdash;though how
the heavens are to perish if the world does not is not easy to
see. And, indeed, in the sacred writings which are peculiar
to ourselves, and not common to the Hebrews and us,&mdash;I
mean the evangelic and apostolic books,&mdash;the following expressions
are used: "The figure of this world passeth away;"<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
"The world passeth away;"<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> "Heaven and earth shall pass
away,"<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>&mdash;expressions which are, I fancy, somewhat milder than
"They shall <i>perish</i>." In the Epistle of the Apostle Peter, too,
where the world which then was is said to have perished,
being overflowed with water, it is sufficiently obvious what
part of the world is signified by the whole, and in what sense
the word <i>perished</i> is to be taken, and what heavens were kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> And when he says a little afterwards,
"The day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a great rush, and the
elements shall melt with burning heat, and the earth and the
works which are in it shall be burned up;" and then adds,
"Seeing, then, that all these things shall be dissolved, what
manner of persons ought ye to be?"<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>&mdash;these heavens which
are to perish may be understood to be the same which he said
were kept in store reserved for fire; and the elements which
are to be burned are those which are full of storm and disturbance
in this lowest part of the world in which he said
that these heavens were kept in store; for the higher heavens
in whose firmament are set the stars are safe, and remain in
their integrity. For even the expression of Scripture, that
"the stars shall fall from heaven,"<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> not to mention that a
different interpretation is much preferable, rather shows
that the heavens themselves shall remain, if the stars are to
fall from them. This expression, then, is either figurative, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
is more credible, or this phenomenon will take place in this
lowest heaven, like that mentioned by Virgil,&mdash;</p>

<p>But the passage I have quoted from the psalm seems to
except none of the heavens from the destiny of destruction;
for he says, "The heavens are the works of Thy hands: they
shall perish;" so that, as none of them are excepted from the
category of God's works, none of them are excepted from
destruction. For our opponents will not condescend to defend
the Hebrew piety, which has won the approbation of their
gods, by the words of the Apostle Peter, whom they vehemently
detest; nor will they argue that, as the apostle in his
epistle understands a part when he speaks of the whole world
perishing in the flood, though only the lowest part of it, and
the corresponding heavens were destroyed, so in the psalm the
whole is used for a part, and it is said "They shall perish,"
though only the lowest heavens are to perish. But since, as
I said, they will not condescend to reason thus, lest they
should seem to approve of Peter's meaning, or ascribe as
much importance to the final conflagration as we ascribe to
the deluge, whereas they contend that no waters or flames
could destroy the whole human race, it only remains to them
to maintain that their gods lauded the wisdom of the Hebrews
because they had not read this psalm.</p>

<p>It is the last judgment of God which is referred to also in
the 50th Psalm in the words, "God shall come manifestly,
our God, and shall not keep silence: fire shall devour before
Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He
shall call the heaven above, and the earth, to judge His
people. Gather His saints together to Him; they who make
a covenant with Him over sacrifices."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> This we understand
of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we look for from heaven to
judge the quick and the dead. For He shall come manifestly
to judge justly the just and the unjust, who before came
hiddenly to be unjustly judged by the unjust. He, I say,
shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence, that is, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
make Himself known by His voice of judgment, who before,
when He came hiddenly, was silent before His judge when
He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and, as a lamb before
the shearer, opened not His mouth, as we read that it was
prophesied of Him by Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> and as we see it fulfilled in the
Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> As for the <i>fire</i> and <i>tempest</i>, we have already said
how these are to be interpreted when we were explaining a
similar passage in Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> As to the expression, "He shall
call the heaven above," as the saints and the righteous are
rightly called <i>heaven</i>, no doubt this means what the apostle
says, "We shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air."<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> For if we take the
bare literal sense, how is it possible to call the heaven above,
as if the heaven could be anywhere else than above? And
the following expression, "And the earth to judge His people,"
if we supply only the words, "He shall call," that is to say,
"He shall call the earth also," and do not supply "above,"
seems to give us a meaning in accordance with sound doctrine,
the heaven symbolizing those who will judge along with
Christ, and the earth those who shall be judged; and thus
the words, "He shall call the heaven above," would not
mean, "He shall catch up into the air," but "He shall lift up
to seats of judgment." Possibly, too, "He shall call the
heaven," may mean, He shall call the angels in the high and
lofty places, that He may descend with them to do judgment;
and "He shall call the earth also" would then mean, He shall
call the men on the earth to judgment. But if with the words
"and the earth" we understand not only "He shall call," but
also "above," so as to make the full sense be, He shall call
the heaven above, and He shall call the earth above, then I
think it is best understood of the men who shall be caught
up to meet Christ in the air, and that they are called <i>the
heaven</i> with reference to their souls, and <i>the earth</i> with reference
to their bodies. Then what is "to judge His people,"
but to separate by judgment the good from the bad, as the
sheep from the goats? Then he turns to address the angels:
"Gather His saints together unto Him." For certainly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
matter so important must be accomplished by the ministry of
angels. And if we ask who the saints are who are gathered
unto Him by the angels, we are told, "They who make a
covenant with Him over sacrifices." This is the whole life of
the saints, to make a covenant with God over sacrifices. For
"over sacrifices" either refers to works of mercy, which are
preferable to sacrifices in the judgment of God, who says,
"I desire mercy more than sacrifices;"<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> or if "over sacrifices"
means in sacrifices, then these very works of mercy are
the sacrifices with which God is pleased, as I remember to
have stated in the tenth book of this work;<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> and in these
works the saints make a covenant with God, because they do
them for the sake of the promises which are contained in His
new testament or covenant. And hence, when His saints
have been gathered to Him and set at His right hand in the
last judgment, Christ shall say, "Come, ye blessed of my
Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave
me to eat,"<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> and so on, mentioning the good works of the
good, and their eternal rewards assigned by the last sentence
of the Judge.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>Of Malachi's prophecy, in which he speaks of the last judgment, and of a
cleansing which some are to undergo by purifying punishments.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The prophet Malachi or Malachias, who is also called Angel,
and is by some (for Jerome<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> tells us that this is the opinion
of the Hebrews) identified with Ezra the priest,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> others of
whose writings have been received into the canon, predicts
the last judgment, saying, "Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord
Almighty; and who shall abide the day of His entrance? ...
for I am the Lord your God, and I change not."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> From
these words it more evidently appears that some shall in the
last judgment suffer some kind of purgatorial punishments;
for what else can be understood by the word, "Who shall
abide the day of His entrance, or who shall be able to look
upon Him? for He enters as a moulder's fire, and as the
herb of fullers: and He shall sit fusing and purifying as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
over gold and silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi,
and pour them out like gold and silver?" Similarly Isaiah
says, "The Lord shall wash the filthiness of the sons and
daughters of Zion, and shall cleanse away the blood from their
midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>
Unless perhaps we should say that they are cleansed from
filthiness and in a manner clarified, when the wicked are
separated from them by penal judgment, so that the elimination
and damnation of the one party is the purgation of the
others, because they shall henceforth live free from the contamination
of such men. But when he says, "And he shall
purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver,
and they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness;
and the sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to
the Lord," he declares that those who shall be purified shall
then please the Lord with sacrifices of righteousness, and consequently
they themselves shall be purified from their own
unrighteousness which made them displeasing to God. Now
they themselves, when they have been purified, shall be sacrifices
of complete and perfect righteousness; for what more
acceptable offering can such persons make to God than themselves?
But this question of purgatorial punishments we
must defer to another time, to give it a more adequate treatment.
By the sons of Levi and Judah and Jerusalem we
ought to understand the Church herself, gathered not from
the Hebrews only, but from other nations as well; nor such
a Church as she now is, when "if we say that we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,"<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> but as she
shall then be, purged by the last judgment as a threshing-floor
by a winnowing wind, and those of her members who need it
being cleansed by fire, so that there remains absolutely not
one who offers sacrifice for his sins. For all who make such
offerings are assuredly in their sins, for the remission of which
they make offerings, that having made to God an acceptable
offering, they may then be absolved.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Of the sacrifices offered to God by the saints, which are to be pleasing to Him,
as in the primitive days and former years.</i></p>

<p>And it was with the design of showing that His city shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
not then follow this custom, that God said that the sons of
Levi should offer sacrifices in righteousness,&mdash;not therefore in
sin, and consequently not for sin. And hence we see how
vainly the Jews promise themselves a return of the old times of
sacrificing according to the law of the old testament, grounding
on the words which follow, "And the sacrifice of Judah and
Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord, as in the primitive
days, and as in former years." For in the times of the law
they offered sacrifices not in righteousness but in sins, offering
especially and primarily for sins, so much so that even the
priest himself, whom we must suppose to have been their most
righteous man, was accustomed to offer, according to God's
commandments, first for his own sins, and then for the sins
of the people. And therefore we must explain how we are
to understand the words, "as in the primitive days, and as in
former years;" for perhaps he alludes to the time in which
our first parents were in paradise. Then, indeed, intact and
pure from all stain and blemish of sin, they offered themselves
to God as the purest sacrifices. But since they were banished
thence on account of their transgression, and human nature
was condemned in them, with the exception of the one Mediator
and those who have been baptized, and are as yet infants,
"there is none clean from stain, not even the babe whose life
has been but for a day upon the earth."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> But if it be replied
that those who offer in faith may be said to offer in righteousness,
because the righteous lives by faith,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>&mdash;he deceives himself,
however, if he says that he has no sin, and therefore he
does not say so, because he lives by faith,&mdash;will any man say
this time of faith can be placed on an equal footing with that
consummation when they who offer sacrifices in righteousness
shall be purified by the fire of the last judgment? And consequently,
since it must be believed that after such a cleansing
the righteous shall retain no sin, assuredly that time, so far as
regards its freedom from sin, can be compared to no other
period, unless to that during which our first parents lived in
paradise in the most innocent happiness before their transgression.
It is this period, then, which is properly understood
when it is said, "as in the primitive days, and as in former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
years." For in Isaiah, too, after the new heavens and the new
earth have been promised, among other elements in the blessedness
of the saints which are there depicted by allegories and
figures, from giving an adequate explanation of which I am
prevented by a desire to avoid prolixity, it is said, "According
to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people."<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
And who that has looked at Scripture does not know where
God planted the tree of life, from whose fruit He excluded
our first parents when their own iniquity ejected them from
paradise, and round which a terrible and fiery fence was set?</p>

<p>But if any one contends that those days of the tree of life
mentioned by the prophet Isaiah are the present times of the
Church of Christ, and that Christ Himself is prophetically
called the Tree of Life, because He is Wisdom, and of wisdom
Solomon says, "It is a tree of life to all who embrace it;"<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
and if they maintain that our first parents did not pass <i>years</i>
in paradise, but were driven from it so soon that none of their
children were begotten there, and that therefore that time
cannot be alluded to in words which run, "as in the primitive
days, and as in former years," I forbear entering on this question,
lest by discussing everything I become prolix, and leave
the whole subject in uncertainty. For I see another meaning,
which should keep us from believing that a restoration of the
primitive days and former years of the legal sacrifices could
have been promised to us by the prophet as a great boon.
For the animals selected as victims under the old law were
required to be immaculate, and free from all blemish whatever,
and symbolized holy men free from all sin, the only instance
of which character was found in Christ. As, therefore,
after the judgment those who are worthy of such purification
shall be purified even by fire, and shall be rendered thoroughly
sinless, and shall offer themselves to God in righteousness, and
be indeed victims immaculate and free from all blemish whatever,
they shall then certainly be "as in the primitive days,
and as in former years," when the purest victims were offered,
the shadow of this future reality. For there shall then be in
the body and soul of the saints the purity which was symbolized
in the bodies of these victims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with reference to those who are worthy not of cleansing
but of damnation, He says, "And I will draw near to you
to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against evil-doers
and against adulterers;" and after enumerating other damnable
crimes, He adds, "For I am the Lord your God, and I am not
changed." It is as if He said, Though your fault has changed
you for the worse, and my grace has changed you for the
better, I am not changed. And he says that He Himself will
be a witness, because in His judgment He needs no witnesses;
and that He will be "swift," either because He is to come
suddenly, and the judgment which seemed to lag shall be very
swift by His unexpected arrival, or because He will convince
the consciences of men directly and without any prolix
harangue. "For," as it is written, "in the thoughts of the
wicked His examination shall be conducted."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> And the
apostle says, "The thoughts accusing or else excusing, in the
day in which God shall judge the hidden things of men, according
to my gospel in Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Thus, then, shall the
Lord be a swift witness, when He shall suddenly bring back
into the memory that which shall convince and punish the
conscience.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the separation of the good and the bad, which proclaim the discriminating
influence of the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>The passage also which I formerly quoted for another purpose
from this prophet refers to the last judgment, in which
he says, "They shall be mine, saith the Lord Almighty, in
the day in which I make up my gains,"<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> etc. When this
diversity between the rewards and punishments which distinguish
the righteous from the wicked shall appear under that
Sun of righteousness in the brightness of life eternal,&mdash;a diversity
which is not discerned under this sun which shines on
the vanity of this life,&mdash;there shall then be such a judgment as
has never before been.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>That the law of Moses must be spiritually understood to preclude the
damnable murmurs of a carnal interpretation.</i></p>

<p>In the succeeding words, "Remember the law of Moses
my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Israel,"<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> the prophet opportunely mentions precepts and statutes,
after declaring the important distinction hereafter to be
made between those who observe and those who despise the
law. He intends also that they learn to interpret the law
spiritually, and find Christ in it, by whose judgment that
separation between the good and the bad is to be made. For
it is not without reason that the Lord Himself says to the
Jews, "Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me;
for he wrote of me."<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> For by receiving the law carnally,
without perceiving that its earthly promises were figures of
things spiritual, they fell into such murmurings as audaciously
to say, "It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that
we have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked suppliantly
before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now
we call aliens happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set
up."<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> It was these words of theirs which in a manner compelled
the prophet to announce the last judgment, in which
the wicked shall not even in appearance be happy, but shall
manifestly be most miserable; and in which the good shall
be oppressed with not even a transitory wretchedness, but
shall enjoy unsullied and eternal felicity. For he had previously
cited some similar expressions of those who said,
"Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord,
and such are pleasing to Him."<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> It was, I say, by understanding
the law of Moses carnally that they had come to
murmur thus against God. And hence, too, the writer of the
73d Psalm says that his feet were almost gone, his steps had
well-nigh slipped, because he was envious of sinners while he
considered their prosperity, so that he said among other things,
How doth God know, and is there knowledge in the Most
High? and again, Have I sanctified my heart in vain, and
washed my hands in innocency?<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> He goes on to say that his
efforts to solve this most difficult problem, which arises when
the good seem to be wretched and the wicked happy, were in
vain until he went into the sanctuary of God, and understood
the last things.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> For in the last judgment things shall not be
so; but in the manifest felicity of the righteous and manifest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
misery of the wicked quite another state of things shall
appear.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the coming of Elias before the judgment, that the Jews may be converted
to Christ by his preaching and explanation of Scripture.</i></p>

<p>After admonishing them to give heed to the law of Moses,
as he foresaw that for a long time to come they would not
understand it spiritually and rightly, he went on to say, "And,
behold, I will send to you Elias the Tishbite before the great
and signal day of the Lord come: and he shall turn the heart
of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his next
of kin, lest I come and utterly smite the earth."<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> It is a
familiar theme in the conversation and heart of the faithful,
that in the last days before the judgment the Jews shall believe
in the true Christ, that is, our Christ, by means of this
great and admirable prophet Elias who shall expound the law
to them. For not without reason do we hope that before the
coming of our Judge and Saviour Elias shall come, because
we have good reason to believe that he is now alive; for, as
Scripture most distinctly informs us,<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> he was taken up from
this life in a chariot of fire. When, therefore, he is come, he
shall give a spiritual explanation of the law which the Jews
at present understand carnally, and shall thus "turn the heart
of the father to the son," that is, the heart of fathers to their
children; for the Septuagint translators have frequently put
the singular for the plural number. And the meaning is, that
the sons, that is, the Jews, shall understand the law as the
fathers, that is, the prophets, and among them Moses himself,
understood it. For the heart of the fathers shall be turned to
their children when the children understand the law as their
fathers did; and the heart of the children shall be turned to
their fathers when they have the same sentiments as the
fathers. The Septuagint used the expression, "and the heart
of a man to his next of kin," because fathers and children are
eminently neighbours to one another. Another and a preferable
sense can be found in the words of the Septuagint translators,
who have translated Scripture with an eye to prophecy,
the sense, viz., that Elias shall turn the heart of God the Father
to the Son, not certainly as if he should bring about this love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
of the Father for the Son, but meaning that he should make
it known, and that the Jews also, who had previously hated,
should then love the Son who is our Christ. For so far as
regards the Jews, God has His heart turned away from our
Christ, this being their conception about God and Christ.
But in their case the heart of God shall be turned to the
Son when they themselves shall turn in heart, and learn the
love of the Father towards the Son. The words following,
"and the heart of a man to his next of kin,"&mdash;that is, Elias shall
also turn the heart of a man to his next of kin,&mdash;how can we
understand this better than as the heart of a man to the man
Christ? For though in the form of God He is our God,
yet, taking the form of a servant, He condescended to become
also our next of kin. It is this, then, which Elias will do,
"lest," he says, "I come and smite the earth utterly." For
they who mind earthly things are the earth. Such are the
carnal Jews until this day; and hence these murmurs of theirs
against God, "The wicked are pleasing to Him," and "It is a
vain thing to serve God."<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>30. <i>That in the books of the Old Testament, where it is said that God shall judge
the world, the person of Christ is not explicitly indicated, but it plainly
appears from some passages in which the Lord God speaks that Christ is
meant.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are many other passages of Scripture bearing on the
last judgment of God,&mdash;so many, indeed, that to cite them all
would swell this book to an unpardonable size. Suffice it to
have proved that both Old and New Testament enounce the
judgment. But in the Old it is not so definitely declared as
in the New that the judgment shall be administered by Christ,
that is, that Christ shall descend from heaven as the Judge;
for when it is therein stated by the Lord God or His prophet
that the Lord God shall come, we do not necessarily understand
this of Christ. For both the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost are the Lord God. We must not, however,
leave this without proof. And therefore we must first show
how Jesus Christ speaks in the prophetical books under the title
of the Lord God, while yet there can be no doubt that it is
Jesus Christ who speaks; so that in other passages where this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
is not at once apparent, and where nevertheless it is said that
the Lord God will come to that last judgment, we may understand
that Jesus Christ is meant. There is a passage in the
prophet Isaiah which illustrates what I mean. For God says
by the prophet, "Hear me, Jacob and Israel, whom I call. I
am the first, and I am for ever: and my hand has founded
the earth, and my right hand has established the heaven. I
will call them, and they shall stand together, and be gathered,
and hear. Who has declared to them these things? In love
of thee I have done thy pleasure upon Babylon, that I might
take away the seed of the Chaldeans. I have spoken, and I
have called: I have brought him, and have made his way
prosperous. Come ye near unto me, and hear this. I have
not spoken in secret from the beginning; when they were
made, there was I. And now the Lord God and His Spirit
hath sent me."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> It was Himself who was speaking as the
Lord God; and yet we should not have understood that it
was Jesus Christ had He not added, "And now the Lord
God and His Spirit hath sent me." For He said this with
reference to the form of a servant, speaking of a future event
as if it were past, as in the same prophet we read, "He was
led as a sheep to the slaughter,"<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> not "He shall be led;" but
the past tense is used to express the future. And prophecy
constantly speaks in this way.</p>

<p>There is also another passage in Zechariah which plainly
declares that the Almighty sent the Almighty; and of what
persons can this be understood but of God the Father and
God the Son? For it is written, "Thus saith the Lord
Almighty, After the glory hath He sent me unto the nations
which spoiled you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the
apple of His eye. Behold, I will bring mine hand upon them,
and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know
that the Lord Almighty hath sent me."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Observe, the Lord
Almighty saith that the Lord Almighty sent Him. Who can
presume to understand these words of any other than Christ,
who is speaking to the lost sheep of the house of Israel? For
He says in the Gospel, "I am not sent save to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel,"<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> which He here compared to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
pupil of God's eye, to signify the profoundest love. And to
this class of sheep the apostles themselves belonged. But
after the glory, to wit, of His resurrection,&mdash;for before it
happened the evangelist said that "Jesus was not yet glorified,"<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>&mdash;He
was sent unto the nations in the persons of His
apostles; and thus the saying of the psalm was fulfilled,
"Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people;
Thou wilt set me as the head of the nations."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> So that those
who had spoiled the Israelites, and whom the Israelites had
served when they were subdued by them, were not themselves
to be spoiled in the same fashion, but were in their own persons
to become the spoil of the Israelites. For this had been
promised to the apostles when the Lord said, "I will make
you fishers of men."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> And to one of them He says, "From
henceforth thou shalt catch men."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> They were then to become
a spoil, but in a good sense, as those who are snatched
from that strong one when he is bound by a stronger.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>In like manner the Lord, speaking by the same prophet,
says, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek
to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I
will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and mercy; and they shall
look upon me because they have insulted me, and they shall
mourn for Him as for one very dear, and shall be in bitterness
as for an only-begotten."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> To whom but to God does
it belong to destroy all the nations that are hostile to the
holy city Jerusalem, which "come against it," that is, are
opposed to it, or, as some translate, "come upon it," as if
putting it down under them; or to pour out upon the house
of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace
and mercy? This belongs doubtless to God, and it is to God
the prophet ascribes the words; and yet Christ shows that
He is the God who does these so great and divine things,
when He goes on to say, "And they shall look upon me because
they have insulted me, and they shall mourn for Him
as if for one very dear (or beloved), and shall be in bitterness
for Him as for an only-begotten." For in that day the Jews&mdash;those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
of them, at least, who shall receive the spirit of grace and
mercy&mdash;when they see Him coming in His majesty, and recognise
that it is He whom they, in the person of their parents,
insulted when He came before in His humiliation, shall repent
of insulting Him in His passion: and their parents themselves,
who were the perpetrators of this huge impiety, shall
see Him when they rise; but this will be only for their
punishment, and not for their correction. It is not of them
we are to understand the words, "And I will pour upon the
house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
spirit of grace and mercy, and they shall look upon me because
they have insulted me;" but we are to understand the
words of their descendants, who shall at that time believe
through Elias. But as we say to the Jews, You killed Christ,
although it was their parents who did so, so these persons
shall grieve that they in some sort did what their progenitors
did. Although, therefore, those that receive the spirit of
mercy and grace, and believe, shall not be condemned with
their impious parents, yet they shall mourn as if they themselves
had done what their parents did. Their grief shall
arise not so much from guilt as from pious affection. Certainly
the words which the Septuagint have translated, "They
shall look upon me because they insulted me," stand in the
Hebrew, "They shall look upon me whom they pierced."<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>
And by this word the crucifixion of Christ is certainly more
plainly indicated. But the Septuagint translators preferred
to allude to the insult which was involved in His whole
passion. For in point of fact they insulted Him both when
He was arrested and when He was bound, when He was
judged, when He was mocked by the robe they put on Him
and the homage they did on bended knee, when He was
crowned with thorns and struck with a rod on the head, when
He bore His cross, and when at last He hung upon the tree.
And therefore we recognise more fully the Lord's passion
when we do not confine ourselves to one interpretation, but
combine both, and read both "insulted" and "pierced."</p>

<p>When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God
is to come to do judgment at the last, from the mere mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to determine
the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant; for
though the Father will judge, He will judge by the coming
of the Son. For He Himself, by His own manifested presence,
"judges no man, but has committed all judgment to
the Son;"<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> for as the Son was judged as a man, He shall
also judge in human form. For it is none but He of whom
God speaks by Isaiah under the name of Jacob and Israel, of
whose seed Christ took a body, as it is written, "Jacob is my
servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, my Spirit
has assumed Him: I have put my Spirit upon Him; He
shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry,
nor cease, neither shall His voice be heard without. A
bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall
He not quench: but in truth shall He bring forth judgment.
He shall shine and shall not be broken, until He sets judgment
in the earth: and the nations shall hope in His name."<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>
The Hebrew has not "Jacob" and "Israel;" but the Septuagint
translators, wishing to show the significance of the
expression "my servant," and that it refers to the form of a
servant in which the Most High humbled Himself, inserted
the name of that man from whose stock He took the form
of a servant. The Holy Spirit was given to Him, and was
manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
He brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted
what was hidden from them. In His meekness He
did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But
His voice was not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He
is not obeyed by those who are outside of His body. And the
Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break,
though as a bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as
smoking flax their light was quenched; for He spared them,
having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought
forth judgment in truth, declaring that they should be
punished did they persist in their wickedness. His face
shone on the Mount,<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> His fame in the world. He is not
broken nor overcome, because neither in Himself nor in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Church has persecution prevailed to annihilate Him. And
therefore that has not, and shall not, be brought about which
His enemies said or say, "When shall He die, and His name
perish?"<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> "until He set judgment in the earth." Behold,
the hidden thing which we were seeking is discovered. For
this is the last judgment, which He will set in the earth
when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we
already see the concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled:
"In His name shall the nations hope." And by this fulfilment,
which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe
in that which is most impudently denied. For who could
have hoped for that which even those who do not yet believe
in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable
that they can but gnash their teeth and pine away?
Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would hope in
the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged,
mocked, crucified, when even the disciples themselves had
lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him? The
hope which was then entertained scarcely by the one thief on
the cross, is now cherished by nations everywhere on the
earth, who are marked with the sign of the cross on which
He died that they may not die eternally.</p>

<p>That the last judgment, then, shall be administered by
Jesus Christ in the manner predicted in the sacred writings
is denied or doubted by no one, unless by those who, through
some incredible animosity or blindness, decline to believe these
writings, though already their truth is demonstrated to all the
world. And at or in connection with that judgment the following
events shall come to pass, as we have learned: Elias
the Tishbite shall come; the Jews shall believe; Antichrist
shall persecute; Christ shall judge; the dead shall rise; the good
and the wicked shall be separated; the world shall be burned
and renewed. All these things, we believe, shall come to
pass; but how, or in what order, human understanding cannot
perfectly teach us, but only the experience of the events themselves.
My opinion, however, is, that they will happen in the
order in which I have related them.</p>

<p>Two books yet remain to be written by me, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
complete, by God's help, what I promised. One of these will
explain the punishment of the wicked, the other the happiness
of the righteous; and in them I shall be at special pains to
refute, by God's grace, the arguments by which some unhappy
creatures seem to themselves to undermine the divine promises
and threatenings, and to ridicule as empty words statements
which are the most salutary nutriment of faith. But they
who are instructed in divine things hold the truth and omnipotence
of God to be the strongest arguments in favour of
those things which, however incredible they seem to men, are
yet contained in the Scriptures, whose truth has already in
many ways been proved; for they are sure that God can in
no wise lie, and that He can do what is impossible to the
unbelieving.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_TWENTY-FIRST" id="BOOK_TWENTY-FIRST">BOOK TWENTY-FIRST.</a></h2>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>OF THE END RESERVED FOR THE CITY OF THE DEVIL, NAMELY, THE ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT OF THE DAMNED; AND OF THE ARGUMENTS WHICH UNBELIEF
BRINGS AGAINST IT.</p>


<p>1. <i>Of the order of the discussion, which requires that we first speak of the eternal
punishment of the lost in company with the devil, and then of the eternal
happiness of the saints.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I propose, with such ability as God may grant me, to
discuss in this book more thoroughly the nature of the
punishment which shall be assigned to the devil and all his
retainers, when the two cities, the one of God, the other of
the devil, shall have reached their proper ends through Jesus
Christ our Lord, the Judge of quick and dead. And I have
adopted this order, and preferred to speak, first of the punishment
of the devils, and afterwards of the blessedness of the
saints, because the <i>body</i> partakes of either destiny; and it
seems to be more incredible that bodies endure in everlasting
torments than that they continue to exist without any pain
in everlasting felicity. Consequently, when I shall have
demonstrated that that punishment ought not to be incredible,
this will materially aid me in proving that which is much
more credible, viz. the immortality of the bodies of the saints
which are delivered from all pain. Neither is this order out
of harmony with the divine writings, in which sometimes,
indeed, the blessedness of the good is placed first, as in the
words, "They that have done good, unto the resurrection of
life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation;"<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> but sometimes also last, as, "The Son of man
shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His
kingdom all things which offend, and shall cast them into a
furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of His Father;"<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> and that, "These shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal."<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>
And though we have not room to cite instances, any one who
examines the prophets will find that they adopt now the one
arrangement and now the other. My own reason for following
the latter order I have given.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Whether it is possible for bodies to last for ever in burning fire.</i></p>

<p>What, then, can I adduce to convince those who refuse to
believe that human bodies, animated and living, can not only
survive death, but also last in the torments of everlasting
fires? They will not allow us to refer this simply to the
power of the Almighty, but demand that we persuade them
by some example. If, then, we reply to them, that there
are animals which certainly are corruptible, because they are
mortal, and which yet live in the midst of flames; and likewise,
that in springs of water so hot that no one can put his
hand in it with impunity a species of worm is found, which
not only lives there, but cannot live elsewhere; they either
refuse to believe these facts unless we can show them, or, if
we are in circumstances to prove them by ocular demonstration
or by adequate testimony, they contend, with the same
scepticism, that these facts are not examples of what we seek
to prove, inasmuch as these animals do not live for ever, and
besides, they live in that blaze of heat without pain, the element
of fire being congenial to their nature, and causing it
to thrive and not to suffer,&mdash;just as if it were not more
incredible that it should thrive than that it should suffer in
such circumstances. It is strange that anything should suffer
in fire and yet live, but stranger that it should live in fire
and not suffer. If, then, the latter be believed, why not also
the former?</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Whether bodily suffering necessarily terminates in the destruction of the flesh.</i></p>

<p>But, say they, there is no body which can suffer and cannot
also die. How do we know this? For who can say with
certainty that the devils do not suffer in their bodies, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
they own that they are grievously tormented? And if it is
replied that there is no earthly body&mdash;that is to say, no solid
and perceptible body, or, in one word, no flesh&mdash;which can
suffer and cannot die, is not this to tell us only what men
have gathered from experience and their bodily senses? For
they indeed have no acquaintance with any flesh but that
which is mortal; and this is their whole argument, that what
they have had no experience of they judge quite impossible.
For we cannot call it reasoning to make pain a presumption
of death, while, in fact, it is rather a sign of life. For though
it be a question whether that which suffers can continue to
live for ever, yet it is certain that everything which suffers
pain does live, and that pain can exist only in a living subject.
It is necessary, therefore, that he who is pained be living, not
necessary that pain kill him; for every pain does not kill even
those mortal bodies of ours which are destined to die. And
that any pain kills them is caused by the circumstance that the
soul is so connected with the body that it succumbs to great
pain and withdraws; for the structure of our members and
vital parts is so infirm that it cannot bear up against that violence
which causes great or extreme agony. But in the life to
come this connection of soul and body is of such a kind, that
as it is dissolved by no lapse of time, so neither is it burst
asunder by any pain. And so, although it be true that in
this world there is no flesh which can suffer pain and yet
cannot die, yet in the world to come there shall be flesh such
as now there is not, as there will also be death such as
now there is not. For death will not be abolished, but
will be eternal, since the soul will neither be able to enjoy
God and live, nor to die and escape the pains of the body.
The first death drives the soul from the body against her will:
the second death holds the soul in the body against her will.
The two have this in common, that the soul suffers against
her will what her own body inflicts.</p>

<p>Our opponents, too, make much of this, that in this world
there is no flesh which can suffer pain and cannot die;
while they make nothing of the fact that there is something
which is greater than the body. For the spirit, whose presence
animates and rules the body, can both suffer pain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
cannot die. Here then is something which, though it can
feel pain, is immortal. And this capacity, which we now see
in the spirit of all, shall be hereafter in the bodies of the
damned. Moreover, if we attend to the matter a little more
closely, we see that what is called bodily pain is rather to be
referred to the soul. For it is the soul, not the body, which
is pained, even when the pain originates with the body,&mdash;the
soul feeling pain at the point where the body is hurt. As then
we speak of bodies feeling and living, though the feeling and
life of the body are from the soul, so also we speak of bodies
being pained, though no pain can be suffered by the body
apart from the soul. The soul, then, is pained with the body
in that part where something occurs to hurt it; and it is
pained alone, though it be in the body, when some invisible
cause distresses it, while the body is safe and sound. Even
when not associated with the body it is pained; for certainly
that rich man was suffering in hell when he cried, "I am
tormented in this flame."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> But as for the body, it suffers no
pain when it is soulless; and even when animate it can
suffer only by the soul's suffering. If, therefore, we might
draw a just presumption from the existence of pain to that of
death, and conclude that where pain can be felt death can
occur, death would rather be the property of the soul, for to
it pain more peculiarly belongs. But, seeing that that which
suffers most cannot die, what ground is there for supposing
that those bodies, because destined to suffer, are therefore
destined to die? The Platonists indeed maintained that these
earthly bodies and dying members gave rise to the fears, desires,
griefs, and joys of the soul. "Hence," says Virgil (<i>i.e.</i> from
these earthly bodies and dying members),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And human laughter, human tears."<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But in the fourteenth book of this work<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> we have proved
that, according to the Platonists' own theory, souls, even when
purged from all pollution of the body, are yet possessed by a
monstrous desire to return again into their bodies. But where
desire can exist, certainly pain also can exist; for desire
frustrated, either by missing what it aims at or losing what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
it had attained, is turned into pain. And therefore, if the
soul, which is either the only or the chief sufferer, has yet a
kind of immortality of its own, it is inconsequent to say that
because the bodies of the damned shall suffer pain, therefore
they shall die. In fine, if the body causes the soul to suffer,
why can the body not cause death as well as suffering, unless
because it does not follow that what causes pain causes death
as well? And why then is it incredible that these fires can
cause pain but not death to those bodies we speak of, just as
the bodies themselves cause pain, but not therefore death, to
the souls? Pain is therefore no necessary presumption of
death.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Examples from nature proving that bodies may remain unconsumed
and alive in fire.</i></p>

<p>If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>
have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have
been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until
now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing
examples that everything which burns is not consumed. As
the soul, too, is a proof that not everything which can suffer
pain can also die, why then do they yet demand that we
produce real examples to prove that it is not incredible that
the bodies of men condemned to everlasting punishment may
retain their soul in the fire, may burn without being consumed,
and may suffer without perishing? For suitable properties
will be communicated to the substance of the flesh by
Him who has endowed the things we see with so marvellous
and diverse properties, that their very multitude prevents our
wonder. For who but God the Creator of all things has given
to the flesh of the peacock its antiseptic property? This
property, when I first heard of it, seemed to me incredible;
but it happened at Carthage that a bird of this kind was
cooked and served up to me, and, taking a suitable slice of
flesh from its breast, I ordered it to be kept, and when it had
been kept as many days as make any other flesh stinking, it
was produced and set before me, and emitted no offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
smell. And after it had been laid by for thirty days and
more, it was still in the same state; and a year after, the
same still, except that it was a little more shrivelled, and
drier. Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves
snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it
ripens green fruit?</p>

<p>But who can explain the strange properties of fire itself,
which blackens everything it burns, though itself bright; and
which, though of the most beautiful colours, discolours almost
all it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into
grimy cinders? Still this is not laid down as an absolutely
uniform law; for, on the contrary, stones baked in glowing
fire themselves also glow, and though the fire be rather of a
red hue, and they white, yet white is congruous with light,
and black with darkness. Thus, though the fire burns the
wood in calcining the stones, these contrary effects do not
result from the contrariety of the materials. For though
wood and stone differ, they are not contraries, like black and
white, the one of which colours is produced in the stones,
while the other is produced in the wood by the same action
of fire, which imparts its own brightness to the former, while
it begrimes the latter, and which could have no effect on the
one were it not fed by the other. Then what wonderful properties
do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light
tap breaks it and a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet is
so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to
decay. So enduring is it, that it is customary in laying down
landmarks to put charcoal underneath them, so that if, after
the longest interval, any one raises an action, and pleads that
there is no boundary stone, he may be convicted by the charcoal
below. What then has enabled it to last so long without
rotting, though buried in the damp earth in which [its original]
wood rots, except this same fire which consumes all things?</p>

<p>Again, let us consider the wonders of lime; for besides
growing white in fire, which makes other things black, and
of which I have already said enough, it has also a mysterious
property of conceiving fire within it. Itself cold to the touch,
it yet has a hidden store of fire, which is not at once apparent
to our senses, but which experience teaches us, lies as it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
slumbering within it even while unseen. And it is for this
reason called "quick lime," as if the fire were the invisible
soul quickening the visible substance or body. But the marvellous
thing is, that this fire is kindled when it is extinguished.
For to disengage the hidden fire the lime is moistened or
drenched with water, and then, though it be cold before, it
becomes hot by that very application which cools what is hot.
As if the fire were departing from the lime and breathing its
last, it no longer lies hid, but appears; and then the lime
lying in the coldness of death cannot be requickened, and
what we before called "quick," we now call "slaked." What
can be stranger than this? Yet there is a greater marvel
still. For if you treat the lime, not with water, but with oil,
which is as fuel to fire, no amount of oil will heat it. Now
if this marvel had been told us of some Indian mineral which
we had no opportunity of experimenting upon, we should
either have forthwith pronounced it a falsehood, or certainly
should have been greatly astonished. But things that daily
present themselves to our own observation we despise, not
because they are really less marvellous, but because they are
common; so that even some products of India itself, remote
as it is from ourselves, cease to excite our admiration as soon
as we can admire them at our leisure.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>The diamond is a stone possessed by many among ourselves,
especially by jewellers and lapidaries, and the stone is so hard
that it can be wrought neither by iron nor fire, nor, they say,
by anything at all except goat's blood. But do you suppose
it is as much admired by those who own it and are familiar
with its properties as by those to whom it is shown for the
first time? Persons who have not seen it perhaps do not
believe what is said of it, or if they do, they wonder as at a
thing beyond their experience; and if they happen to see it,
still they marvel because they are unused to it, but gradually
familiar experience [of it] dulls their admiration. We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
that the loadstone has a wonderful power of attracting iron.
When I first saw it I was thunderstruck, for I saw an iron
ring attracted and suspended by the stone; and then, as if it
had communicated its own property to the iron it attracted,
and had made it a substance like itself, this ring was put
near another, and lifted it up; and as the first ring clung to
the magnet, so did the second ring to the first. A third and a
fourth were similarly added, so that there hung from the stone
a kind of chain of rings, with their hoops connected, not interlinking,
but attached together by their outer surface. Who
would not be amazed at this virtue of the stone, subsisting as
it does not only in itself, but transmitted through so many
suspended rings, and binding them together by invisible links?
Yet far more astonishing is what I heard about this stone
from my brother in the episcopate, Severus bishop of Milevis.
He told me that Bathanarius, once count of Africa, when the
bishop was dining with him, produced a magnet, and held it
under a silver plate on which he placed a bit of iron; then as
he moved his hand with the magnet underneath the plate, the
iron upon the plate moved about accordingly. The intervening
silver was not affected at all, but precisely as the magnet
was moved backwards and forwards below it, no matter how
quickly, so was the iron attracted above. I have related what
I myself have witnessed; I have related what I was told by
one whom I trust as I trust my own eyes. Let me further
say what I have read about this magnet. When a diamond
is laid near it, it does not lift iron; or if it has already lifted
it, as soon as the diamond approaches, it drops it. These
stones come from India. But if we cease to admire them
because they are now familiar, how much less must they
admire them who procure them very easily and send them
to us? Perhaps they are held as cheap as we hold lime,
which, because it is common, we think nothing of, though it
has the strange property of burning when water, which is
wont to quench fire, is poured on it, and of remaining cool
when mixed with oil, which ordinarily feeds fire.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>That there are many things which reason cannot account for, and which
are nevertheless true.</i></p>

<p>Nevertheless, when we declare the miracles which God has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
wrought, or will yet work, and which we cannot bring under
the very eyes of men, sceptics keep demanding that we shall
explain these marvels to reason. And because we cannot do
so, inasmuch as they are above human comprehension, they
suppose we are speaking falsely. These persons themselves,
therefore, ought to account for all these marvels which we
either can or do see. And if they perceive that this is impossible
for man to do, they should acknowledge that it cannot
be concluded that a thing has not been or shall not be because
it cannot be reconciled to reason, since there are things now
in existence of which the same is true. I will not, then,
detail the multitude of marvels which are related in books,
and which refer not to things that happened once and passed
away, but that are permanent in certain places, where, if any
one has the desire and opportunity, he may ascertain their
truth; but a few only I recount. The following are some of
the marvels men tell us:&mdash;The salt of Agrigentum in Sicily,
when thrown into the fire, becomes fluid as if it were in
water, but in the water it crackles as if it were in the
fire. The Garamantæ have a fountain so cold by day that
no one can drink it, so hot by night no one can touch it.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>
In Epirus, too, there is a fountain which, like all others,
quenches lighted torches, but, unlike all others, lights quenched
torches. There is a stone found in Arcadia, and called asbestos,
because once lit it cannot be put out. The wood of a certain
kind of Egyptian fig-tree sinks in water, and does not float
like other wood; and, stranger still, when it has been sunk
to the bottom for some time, it rises again to the surface,
though nature requires that when soaked in water it should
be heavier than ever. Then there are the apples of Sodom,
which grow indeed to an appearance of ripeness, but, when
you touch them with hand or tooth, the peel cracks, and they
crumble into dust and ashes. The Persian stone pyrites burns
the hand when it is tightly held in it, and so gets its name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
from fire. In Persia, too, there is found another stone called
selenite, because its interior brilliancy waxes and wanes with
the moon. Then in Cappadocia the mares are impregnated
by the wind, and their foals live only three years. Tilon,
an Indian island, has this advantage over all other lands,
that no tree which grows in it ever loses its foliage.</p>

<p>These and numberless other marvels recorded in the history,
not of past events, but of permanent localities, I have no time
to enlarge upon and diverge from my main object; but let
those sceptics who refuse to credit the divine writings give
me, if they can, a rational account of them. For their only
ground of unbelief in the Scriptures is, that they contain
incredible things, just such as I have been recounting. For,
say they, reason cannot admit that flesh burn and remain
unconsumed, suffer without dying. Mighty reasoners, indeed,
who are competent to give the reason of all the marvels that
exist! Let them then give us the reason of the few things
we have cited, and which, if they did not know they existed,
and were only assured by us they would at some future time
occur, they would believe still less than that which they now
refuse to credit on our word. For which of them would
believe us if, instead of saying that the living bodies of men
hereafter will be such as to endure everlasting pain and fire
without ever dying, we were to say that in the world to come
there will be salt which becomes liquid in fire as if it were
in water, and crackles in water as if it were in fire; or that
there will be a fountain whose water in the chill air of night
is so hot that it cannot be touched, while in the heat of day
it is so cold that it cannot be drunk; or that there will be a
stone which by its own heat burns the hand when tightly
held, or a stone which cannot be extinguished if it has been
lit in any part; or any of those wonders I have cited, while
omitting numberless others? If we were to say that these
things would be found in the world to come, and our sceptics
were to reply, "If you wish us to believe these things, satisfy
our reason about each of them," we should confess that we
could not, because the frail comprehension of man cannot
master these and such-like wonders of God's working; and
that yet our reason was thoroughly convinced that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
Almighty does nothing without reason, though the frail
mind of man cannot explain the reason; and that while we
are in many instances uncertain what He intends, yet that it
is always most certain that nothing which He intends is impossible
to Him; and that when He declares His mind, we
believe Him whom we cannot believe to be either powerless
or false. Nevertheless these cavillers at faith and exactors
of reason, how do they dispose of those things of which a reason
cannot be given, and which yet exist, though in apparent contrariety
to the nature of things? If we had announced that
these things were to be, these sceptics would have demanded
from us the reason of them, as they do in the case of those
things which we are announcing as destined to be. And consequently,
as these present marvels are not non-existent, though
human reason and discourse are lost in such works of God, so
those things we speak of are not impossible because inexplicable;
for in this particular they are in the same predicament
as the marvels of earth.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That all marvels are not of nature's production, but that some are due to
human ingenuity and others to diabolic contrivance.</i></p>

<p>At this point they will perhaps reply, "These things have
no existence; we don't believe one of them; they are travellers'
tales and fictitious romances;" and they may add what has
the appearance of argument, and say, "If you believe such
things as these, believe what is recorded in the same books,
that there was or is a temple of Venus in which a candelabrum
set in the open air holds a lamp, which burns so strongly
that no storm or rain extinguishes it, and which is therefore
called, like the stone mentioned above, the asbestos or inextinguishable
lamp." They may say this with the intention of
putting us into a dilemma: for if we say this is incredible,
then we shall impugn the truth of the other recorded marvels;
if, on the other hand, we admit that this is credible, we shall
avouch the pagan deities. But, as I have already said in the
eighteenth book of this work, we do not hold it necessary to
believe all that profane history contains, since, as Varro says,
even historians themselves disagree on so many points, that
one would think they intended and were at pains to do so;
but we believe, if we are disposed, those things which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
contradicted by these books, which we do not hesitate to say
we <i>are</i> bound to believe. But as to those permanent miracles
of nature, whereby we wish to persuade the sceptical of the
miracles of the world to come, those are quite sufficient for
our purpose which we ourselves can observe, or of which it is
not difficult to find trustworthy witnesses. Moreover, that
temple of Venus, with its inextinguishable lamp, so far from
hemming us into a corner, opens an advantageous field to
our argument. For to this inextinguishable lamp we add a
host of marvels wrought by men, or by magic,&mdash;that is, by
men under the influence of devils, or by the devils directly,&mdash;for
such marvels we cannot deny without impugning the truth
of the sacred Scriptures we believe. That lamp, therefore,
was either by some mechanical and human device fitted with
asbestos, or it was arranged by magical art in order that the
worshippers might be astonished, or some devil under the
name of Venus so signally manifested himself that this prodigy
both began and became permanent. Now devils are attracted to
dwell in certain temples by means of the creatures (God's creatures,
not theirs), who present to them what suits their various
tastes. They are attracted not by food like animals, but, like
spirits, by such symbols as suit their taste, various kinds of
stones, woods, plants, animals, songs, rites. And that men
may provide these attractions, the devils first of all cunningly
seduce them, either by imbuing their hearts with a secret
poison, or by revealing themselves under a friendly guise, and
thus make a few of them their disciples, who become the instructors
of the multitude. For unless they first instructed men,
it were impossible to know what each of them desires, what
they shrink from, by what name they should be invoked or
constrained to be present. Hence the origin of magic and
magicians. But, above all, they possess the hearts of men, and
are chiefly proud of this possession when they transform themselves
into angels of light. Very many things that occur,
therefore, are their doing; and these deeds of theirs we ought
all the more carefully to shun as we acknowledge them to be
very surprising. And yet these very deeds forward my present
arguments. For if such marvels are wrought by unclean
devils, how much mightier are the holy angels! and what cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
that God do who made the angels themselves capable of
working miracles!</p>

<p>If, then, very many effects can be contrived by human art,
of so surprising a kind that the uninitiated think them divine,
as when, <i>e.g.</i>, in a certain temple two magnets have been adjusted,
one in the roof, another in the floor, so that an iron
image is suspended in mid-air between them, one would suppose
by the power of the divinity, were he ignorant of the
magnets above and beneath; or, as in the case of that lamp of
Venus which we already mentioned as being a skilful adaptation
of asbestos; if, again, by the help of magicians, whom Scripture
calls sorcerers and enchanters, the devils could gain such
power that the noble poet Virgil should consider himself justified
in describing a very powerful magician in these lines:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>if this be so, how much more able is God to do those things
which to sceptics are incredible, but to His power easy, since
it is He who has given to stones and all other things their
virtue, and to men their skill to use them in wonderful ways;
He who has given to the angels a nature more mighty than
that of all that lives on earth; He whose power surpasses all
marvels, and whose wisdom in working, ordaining, and permitting
is no less marvellous in its governance of all things
than in its creation of all!</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That the ultimate reason for believing miracles is the omnipotence of the
Creator.</i></p>

<p>Why, then, cannot God effect both that the bodies of the
dead shall rise, and that the bodies of the damned shall be
tormented in everlasting fire,&mdash;God, who made the world full
of countless miracles in sky, earth, air, and waters, while itself
is a miracle unquestionably greater and more admirable than
all the marvels it is filled with? But those with whom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
against whom we are arguing, who believe both that there is
a God who made the world, and that there are gods created
by Him who administer the world's laws as His vicegerents,&mdash;our
adversaries, I say, who, so far from denying emphatically,
assert that there are powers in the world which effect marvellous
results (whether of their own accord, or because they
are invoked by some rite or prayer, or in some magical way),
when we lay before them the wonderful properties of other
things which are neither rational animals nor rational spirits,
but such material objects as those we have just cited, are
in the habit of replying, This is their natural property, their
nature; these are the powers naturally belonging to them.
Thus the whole reason why Agrigentine salt dissolves in fire
and crackles in water is that this is its nature. Yet this seems
rather contrary to nature, which has given not to fire but to
water the power of melting salt, and the power of scorching it
not to water but to fire. But this, they say, is the natural
property of <i>this</i> salt, to show effects contrary to these. The
same reason, therefore, is assigned to account for that Garamantian
fountain, of which one and the same runlet is chill
by day and boiling by night, so that in either extreme it cannot
be touched. So also of that other fountain which, though
it is cold to the touch, and though it, like other fountains,
extinguishes a lighted torch, yet, unlike other fountains, and
in a surprising manner, kindles an extinguished torch. So of
the asbestos stone, which, though it has no heat of its own, yet
when kindled by fire applied to it, cannot be extinguished.
And so of the rest, which I am weary of reciting, and in which,
though there seems to be an extraordinary property contrary
to nature, yet no other reason is given for them than this, that
this is their nature,&mdash;a brief reason truly, and, I own, a satisfactory
reply. But since God is the author of all natures,
how is it that our adversaries, when they refuse to believe
what we affirm, on the ground that it is impossible, are unwilling
to accept from us a better explanation than their own,
viz. that this is the will of Almighty God,&mdash;for certainly He
is called Almighty only because He is mighty to do all He
will,&mdash;He who was able to create so many marvels, not only
unknown, but very well ascertained, as I have been showing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
and which, were they not under our own observation, or reported
by recent and credible witnesses, would certainly be
pronounced impossible? For as for those marvels which have
no other testimony than the writers in whose books we read
them, and who wrote without being divinely instructed, and are
therefore liable to human error, we cannot justly blame any
one who declines to believe them.</p>

<p>For my own part, I do not wish all the marvels I have
cited to be rashly accepted, for I do not myself believe them
implicitly, save those which have either come under my own
observation, or which any one can readily verify,&mdash;such as the
lime which is heated by water and cooled by oil; the magnet
which by its mysterious and insensible suction attracts the
iron, but has no effect on a straw; the peacock's flesh which
triumphs over the corruption from which not the flesh of
Plato is exempt; the chaff so chilling that it prevents snow
from melting, so heating that it forces apples to ripen; the
glowing fire, which, in accordance with its glowing appearance,
whitens the stones it bakes, while, contrary to its glowing
appearance, it begrimes most things it burns (just as dirty
stains are made by oil, however pure it be, and as the lines
drawn by white silver are black); the charcoal, too, which by
the action of fire is so completely changed from its original,
that a finely marked piece of wood becomes hideous, the tough
becomes brittle, the decaying incorruptible. Some of these
things I know in common with many other persons, some of
them in common with all men; and there are many others
which I have not room to insert in this book. But of those
which I have cited, though I have not myself seen, but only
read about them, I have been unable to find trustworthy witnesses
from whom I could ascertain whether they are facts,
except in the case of that fountain in which burning torches
are extinguished and extinguished torches lit, and of the
apples of Sodom, which are ripe to appearance, but are filled
with dust. And indeed I have not met with any who said
they had seen that fountain in Epirus, but with some who
knew there was a similar fountain in Gaul not far from
Grenoble. The fruit of the trees of Sodom, however, is not
only spoken of in books worthy of credit, but so many persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
say that they have seen it that I cannot doubt the fact.
But the rest of the prodigies I receive without definitely
affirming or denying them; and I have cited them because I
read them in the authors of our adversaries, and that I might
prove how many things many among themselves believe, because
they are written in the works of their own literary men,
though no rational explanation of them is given, and yet they
scorn to believe us when we assert that Almighty God will do
what is beyond their experience and observation; and this they
do even though we assign a reason for His work. For what
better and stronger reason for such things can be given than
to say that the Almighty is able to bring them to pass, and
will bring them to pass, having predicted them in those books
in which many other marvels which have already come to
pass were predicted? Those things which are regarded as
impossible will be accomplished according to the word, and by
the power of that God who predicted and effected that the
incredulous nations should believe incredible wonders.</p>

<p>8. <i>That it is not contrary to nature that, in an object whose nature is known,

<p>But if they reply that their reason for not believing us
when we say that human bodies will always burn and yet never
die, is that the nature of human bodies is known to be quite
otherwise constituted; if they say that for this miracle we
cannot give the reason which was valid in the case of those
natural miracles, viz. that this is the natural property, the
nature of the thing,&mdash;for we know that this is not the nature
of human flesh,&mdash;we find our answer in the sacred writings,
that even this human flesh was constituted in one fashion
before there was sin,&mdash;was constituted, in fact, so that it
could not die,&mdash;and in another fashion after sin, being made
such as we see it in this miserable state of mortality, unable
to retain enduring life. And so in the resurrection of the
dead shall it be constituted differently from its present well-known
condition. But as they do not believe these writings
of ours, in which we read what nature man had in paradise,
and how remote he was from the necessity of death,&mdash;and
indeed, if they did believe them, we should of course have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
little trouble in debating with them the future punishment
of the damned,&mdash;we must produce from the writings of their
own most learned authorities some instances to show that it
is possible for a thing to become different from what it was
formerly known characteristically to be.</p>

<p>From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled, <i>Of the Race Of
the Roman People</i>, I cite word for word the following instance:
"There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for
Castor records that, in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo
by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there
occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed its colour, size,
form, course, which never happened before nor since. Adrastus
of Cyzicus, and Dion of Naples, famous mathematicians, said
that this occurred in the reign of Ogyges." So great an
author as Varro would certainly not have called this a portent
had it not seemed to be contrary to nature. For we say
that all portents are contrary to nature; but they are not so.
For how is that contrary to nature which happens by the
will of God, since the will of so mighty a Creator is certainly
the nature of each created thing? A portent, therefore, happens
not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as
nature. But who can number the multitude of portents
recorded in profane histories? Let us then at present fix
our attention on this one only which concerns the matter in
hand. What is there so arranged by the Author of the nature
of heaven and earth as the exactly ordered course of the
stars? What is there established by laws so sure and inflexible?
And yet, when it pleased Him who with sovereignty
and supreme power regulates all He has created, a
star conspicuous among the rest by its size and splendour
changed its colour, size, form, and, most wonderful of all, the
order and law of its course! Certainly that phenomenon
disturbed the canons of the astronomers, if there were any
then, by which they tabulate, as by unerring computation, the
past and future movements of the stars, so as to take upon
them to affirm that this which happened to the morning star
(Venus) never happened before nor since. But we read in
the divine books that even the sun itself stood still when a
holy man, Joshua the son of Nun, had begged this from God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
until victory should finish the battle he had begun; and that
it even went back, that the promise of fifteen years added to
the life of king Hezekiah might be sealed by this additional
prodigy. But these miracles, which were vouchsafed to the
merits of holy men, even when our adversaries believe them,
they attribute to magical arts; so Virgil, in the lines I quoted
above, ascribes to magic the power to</p>

<span class="i0">"Turn rivers backward to their source,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And make the stars forget their course."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For in our sacred books we read that this also happened,
that a river "turned backward," was stayed above while the
lower part flowed on, when the people passed over under the
above-mentioned leader, Joshua the son of Nun; and also when
Elias the prophet crossed; and afterwards, when his disciple
Elisha passed through it: and we have just mentioned how,
in the case of king Hezekiah, the greatest of the "stars forgot
its course." But what happened to Venus, according to Varro,
was not said by him to have happened in answer to any man's
prayer.</p>

<p>Let not the sceptics then benight themselves in this knowledge
of the nature of things, as if divine power cannot
bring to pass in an object anything else than what their own
experience has shown them to be in its nature. Even the
very things which are most commonly known as natural
would not be less wonderful nor less effectual to excite surprise
in all who beheld them, if men were not accustomed to
admire nothing but what is rare. For who that thoughtfully
observes the countless multitude of men, and their similarity
of nature, can fail to remark with surprise and admiration the
individuality of each man's appearance, suggesting to us, as it
does, that unless men were like one another, they would not
be distinguished from the rest of the animals; while unless,
on the other hand, they were unlike, they could not be distinguished
from one another, so that those whom we declare
to be like, we also find to be unlike? And the unlikeness is
the more wonderful consideration of the two; for a common
nature seems rather to require similarity. And yet, because
the very rarity of things is that which makes them wonderful,
we are filled with much greater wonder when we are introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
to two men so like, that we either always or frequently
mistake in endeavouring to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>But possibly, though Varro is a heathen historian, and a
very learned one, they may disbelieve that what I have cited
from him truly occurred; or they may say the example is invalid,
because the star did not for any length of time continue
to follow its new course, but returned to its ordinary orbit.
There is, then, another phenomenon at present open to their
observation, and which, in my opinion, ought to be sufficient
to convince them that, though they have observed and ascertained
some natural law, they ought not on that account
to prescribe to God, as if He could not change and turn it
into something very different from what they have observed.
The land of Sodom was not always as it now is; but once
it had the appearance of other lands, and enjoyed equal if
not richer fertility; for, in the divine narrative, it was compared
to the paradise of God. But after it was touched [by
fire] from heaven, as even pagan history testifies, and as is
now witnessed by those who visit the spot, it became unnaturally
and horribly sooty in appearance; and its apples,
under a deceitful appearance of ripeness, contain ashes within.
Here is a thing which was of one kind, and is of another.
You see how its nature was converted by the wonderful
transmutation wrought by the Creator of all natures into so
very disgusting a diversity,&mdash;an alteration which after so long
a time took place, and after so long a time still continues.</p>

<p>As therefore it was not impossible to God to create such
natures as He pleased, so it is not impossible to Him to
change these natures of His own creation into whatever He
pleases, and thus spread abroad a multitude of those marvels
which are called monsters, portents, prodigies, phenomena,<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
and which if I were minded to cite and record, what end
would there be to this work? They say that they are called
"monsters," because they <i>demonstrate</i> or signify something;
"portents," because they <i>portend</i> something; and so forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>
But let their diviners see how they are either deceived, or
even when they do predict true things, it is because they
are inspired by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the
minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such a fate) in the meshes
of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon
some truth, because they make so many predictions. Yet,
for our part, these things which happen contrary to nature,
and are said to be contrary to nature (as the apostle, speaking
after the manner of men, says, that to graff the wild olive
into the good olive, and to partake of its fatness, is contrary
to nature), and are called monsters, phenomena, portents, prodigies,
ought to demonstrate, portend, predict that God will
bring to pass what He has foretold regarding the bodies of
men, no difficulty preventing Him, no law of nature prescribing
to Him His limit. How He has foretold what He
is to do, I think I have sufficiently shown in the preceding
book, culling from the sacred Scriptures, both of the New and
Old Testaments, not, indeed, all the passages that relate to
this, but as many as I judged to suffice for this work.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of hell, and the nature of eternal punishments.</i></p>

<p>So then what God by His prophet has said of the everlasting
punishment of the damned shall come to pass&mdash;shall
without fail come to pass,&mdash;"their worm shall not die, neither
shall their fire be quenched."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> In order to impress this upon
us most forcibly, the Lord Jesus Himself, when ordering us to
cut off our members, meaning thereby those persons whom a
man loves as the most useful members of his body, says, "It
is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two
hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched;
where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched."
Similarly of the foot: "It is better for thee to enter halt into
life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched; where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not quenched." So, too, of the eye: "It is
better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye,
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire; where their
worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
shrink from using the same words three times over in one
passage. And who is not terrified by this repetition, and by
the threat of that punishment uttered so vehemently by the
lips of the Lord Himself?</p>

<p>Now they who would refer both the fire and the worm to
the spirit, and not to the body, affirm that the wicked, who are
separated from the kingdom of God, shall be burned, as it were,
by the anguish of a spirit repenting too late and fruitlessly;
and they contend that fire is therefore not inappropriately used
to express this burning torment, as when the apostle exclaims,
"Who is offended, and I burn not?"<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> The worm, too, they
think, is to be similarly understood. For it is written, they
say, "As the moth consumes the garment, and the worm the
wood, so does grief consume the heart of a man."<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> But they
who make no doubt that in that future punishment both body
and soul shall suffer, affirm that the body shall be burned with
fire, while the soul shall be, as it were, gnawed by a worm of
anguish. Though this view is more reasonable,&mdash;for it is absurd
to suppose that either body or soul will escape pain in the
future punishment,&mdash;yet, for my own part, I find it easier to
understand both as referring to the body than to suppose that
neither does; and I think that Scripture is silent regarding
the spiritual pain of the damned, because, though not expressed,
it is necessarily understood that in a body thus tormented the
soul also is tortured with a fruitless repentance. For we read
in the ancient Scriptures, "The vengeance of the flesh of the
ungodly is fire and worms."<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> It might have been more briefly
said, "The vengeance of the ungodly." Why, then, was it said,
"The flesh of the ungodly," unless because both the fire and
the worm are to be the punishment of the flesh? Or if the
object of the writer in saying, "The vengeance of the flesh,"
was to indicate that this shall be the punishment of those who
live after the flesh (for this leads to the second death, as the
apostle intimated when he said, "For if ye live after the flesh,
ye shall die"<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>), let each one make his own choice, either
assigning the fire to the body and the worm to the soul,&mdash;the
one figuratively, the other really,&mdash;or assigning both really to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
the body. For I have already sufficiently made out that
animals can live in the fire, in burning without being consumed,
in pain without dying, by a miracle of the most omnipotent
Creator, to whom no one can deny that this is possible, if
he be not ignorant by whom has been made all that is wonderful
in all nature. For it is God Himself who has wrought all
these miracles, great and small, in this world which I have
mentioned, and incomparably more which I have omitted, and
who has enclosed these marvels in this world, itself the greatest
miracle of all. Let each man, then, choose which he will,
whether he thinks that the worm is real and pertains to the
body, or that spiritual things are meant by bodily representations,
and that it belongs to the soul. But which of these is
true will be more readily discovered by the facts themselves,
when there shall be in the saints such knowledge as shall not
require that their own experience teach them the nature of
these punishments, but as shall, by its own fulness and perfection,
suffice to instruct them in this matter. For "now we
know in part, until that which is perfect is come;"<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> only, this
we believe about those future bodies, that they shall be such
as shall certainly be pained by the fire.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Whether the fire of hell, if it be material fire, can burn the wicked spirits,
that is to say, devils, who are immaterial.</i></p>

<p>Here arises the question: If the fire is not to be immaterial,
analogous to the pain of the soul, but material, burning by
contact, so that bodies may be tormented in it, how can evil
spirits be punished in it? For it is undoubtedly the same
fire which is to serve for the punishment of men and of devils,
according to the words of Christ: "Depart from me, ye cursed,
into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;"<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
unless, perhaps, as learned men have thought, the devils have
a kind of body made of that dense and humid air which we
feel strikes us when the wind is blowing. And if this kind
of substance could not be affected by fire, it could not burn
when heated in the baths. For in order to burn, it is first
burned, and affects other things as itself is affected. But if
any one maintains that the devils have no bodies, this is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
a matter either to be laboriously investigated, or to be debated
with keenness. For why may we not assert that even immaterial
spirits may, in some extraordinary way, yet really be
pained by the punishment of material fire, if the spirits of
men, which also are certainly immaterial, are both now contained
in material members of the body, and in the world to
come shall be indissolubly united to their own bodies? Therefore,
though the devils have no bodies, yet their spirits, that
is, the devils themselves, shall be brought into thorough contact
with the material fires, to be tormented by them; not
that the fires themselves with which they are brought into
contact shall be animated by their connection with these spirits,
and become animals composed of body and spirit, but, as I
said, this junction will be effected in a wonderful and ineffable
way, so that they shall receive pain from the fires, but give no
life to them. And, in truth, this other mode of union, by
which bodies and spirits are bound together and become
animals, is thoroughly marvellous, and beyond the comprehension
of man, though this it is which is man.</p>

<p>I would indeed say that these spirits will burn without any
body of their own, as that rich man was burning in hell when
he exclaimed, "I am tormented in this flame,"<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> were I not
aware that it is aptly said in reply, that that flame was of the
same nature as the eyes he raised and fixed on Lazarus, as the
tongue on which he entreated that a little cooling water might
be dropped, or as the finger of Lazarus, with which he asked
that this might be done,&mdash;all of which took place where souls
exist without bodies. Thus, therefore, both that flame in
which he burned and that drop he begged were immaterial,
and resembled the visions of sleepers or persons in an ecstasy,
to whom immaterial objects appear in a bodily form. For the
man himself who is in such a state, though it be in spirit
only, not in body, yet sees himself so like to his own body
that he cannot discern any difference whatever. But that
hell, which also is called a lake of fire and brimstone,<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> will be
material fire, and will torment the bodies of the damned,
whether men or devils,&mdash;the solid bodies of the one, aerial
bodies of the others; or if only men have bodies as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
souls, yet the evil spirits, though without bodies, shall be so
connected with the bodily fires as to receive pain without
imparting life. One fire certainly shall be the lot of both,
for thus the truth has declared.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Whether it is just that the punishments of sins last longer than the sins
themselves lasted.</i></p>

<p>Some, however, of those against whom we are defending the
city of God, think it unjust that any man be doomed to an
eternal punishment for sins which, no matter how great they
were, were perpetrated in a brief space of time; as if any law
ever regulated the duration of the punishment by the duration
of the offence punished! Cicero tells us that the laws recognise
eight kinds of penalty,&mdash;damages, imprisonment, scourging,
reparation,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one
of these which may be compressed into a brevity proportioned
to the rapid commission of the offence, so that no longer time
may be spent in its punishment than in its perpetration, unless,
perhaps, reparation? For this requires that the offender
suffer what he did, as that clause of the law says, "Eye for
eye, tooth for tooth."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> For certainly it is possible for an
offender to lose his eye by the severity of legal retaliation in
as brief a time as he deprived another of his eye by the
cruelty of his own lawlessness. But if scourging be a reasonable
penalty for kissing another man's wife, is not the fault
of an instant visited with long hours of atonement, and the
momentary delight punished with lasting pain? What shall
we say of imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only
for so long a time as he spent on the offence for which he is
committed? or is not a penalty of many years' confinement
imposed on the slave who has provoked his master with a
word, or has struck him a blow that is quickly over? And
as to damages, disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly
inflicted so as to admit of no relaxation or pardon, do not these
resemble eternal punishments in so far as this short life allows
a resemblance? For they are not eternal only because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
life in which they are endured is not eternal; and yet the
crimes which are punished with these most protracted sufferings
are perpetrated in a very brief space of time. Nor is
there any one who would suppose that the pains of punishment
should occupy as short a time as the offence; or that
murder, adultery, sacrilege, or any other crime, should be
measured, not by the enormity of the injury or wickedness,
but by the length of time spent in its perpetration. Then as
to the award of death for any great crime, do the laws reckon
the punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death
is inflicted, or in this, that the offender is eternally banished
from the society of the living? And just as the punishment
of the first death cuts men off from this present mortal city,
so does the punishment of the second death cut men off from
that future immortal city. For as the laws of this present
city do not provide for the executed criminal's return to it, so
neither is he who is condemned to the second death recalled
again to life everlasting. But if temporal sin is visited with
eternal punishment, how, then, they say, is that true which
your Christ says, "With the same measure that ye mete
withal it shall be measured to you again?"<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> and they do not
observe that "the same measure" refers, not to an equal space
of time, but to the retribution of evil, or, in other words, to
the law by which he who has done evil suffers evil. Besides,
these words could be appropriately understood as referring to
the matter of which our Lord was speaking when He used
them, viz. judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who
unjustly judges and condemns is himself justly judged and
condemned, he receives "with the same measure" though not
the same thing as he gave. For judgment he gave, and judgment
he receives, though the judgment he gave was unjust,
the judgment he receives just.</p>

<p>12. <i>Of the greatness of the first transgression, on account of which eternal
punishment is due to all who are not within the pale of the Saviour's
grace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But eternal punishment seems hard and unjust to human
perceptions, because in the weakness of our mortal condition
there is wanting that highest and purest wisdom by which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
can be perceived how great a wickedness was committed in
that first transgression. The more enjoyment man found in
God, the greater was his wickedness in abandoning Him;
and he who destroyed in himself a good which might have
been eternal, became worthy of eternal evil. Hence the
whole mass of the human race is condemned; for he who at
first gave entrance to sin has been punished with all his posterity
who were in him as in a root, so that no one is exempt
from this just and due punishment, unless delivered by mercy
and undeserved grace; and the human race is so apportioned
that in some is displayed the efficacy of merciful grace, in the
rest the efficacy of just retribution. For both could not be
displayed in all; for if all had remained<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> under the punishment
of just condemnation, there would have been seen in no
one the mercy of redeeming grace. And, on the other hand, if
all had been transferred from darkness to light, the severity of
retribution would have been manifested in none. But many
more are left under punishment than are delivered from it, in
order that it may thus be shown what was due to all. And
had it been inflicted on all, no one could justly have found
fault with the justice of Him who taketh vengeance; whereas,
in the deliverance of so many from that just award, there is
cause to render the most cordial thanks to the gratuitous
bounty of Him who delivers.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Against the opinion of those who think that the punishments of the wicked
after death are purgatorial.</i></p>

<p>The Platonists, indeed, while they maintain that no sins
are unpunished, suppose that all punishment is administered
for remedial purposes,<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> be it inflicted by human or divine law,
in this life or after death; for a man may be scathless here,
or, though punished, may yet not amend. Hence that passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
of Virgil, where, when he had said of our earthly bodies and
mortal members, that our souls derive&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>They who are of this opinion would have all punishments
after death to be purgatorial; and as the elements of air, fire,
and water are superior to earth, one or other of these may be
the instrument of expiating and purging away the stain contracted
by the contagion of earth. So Virgil hints at the air
in the words, "Some hang aloft for winds to pierce;" at the
water in "whelming tide;" and at fire in the expression "in
burning fire." For our part, we recognise that even in this
life some punishments are purgatorial,&mdash;not, indeed, to those
whose life is none the better, but rather the worse for them,
but to those who are constrained by them to amend their life.
All other punishments, whether temporal or eternal, inflicted
as they are on every one by divine providence, are sent either
on account of past sins, or of sins presently allowed in the
life, or to exercise and reveal a man's graces. They may be
inflicted by the instrumentality of bad men and angels as well
as of the good. For even if any one suffers some hurt through
another's wickedness or mistake, the man indeed sins whose
ignorance or injustice does the harm; but God, who by His
just though hidden judgment permits it to be done, sins not.
But temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but
all of them before that last and strictest judgment. But of
those who suffer temporary punishments after death, all are
not doomed to those everlasting pains which are to follow
that judgment; for to some, as we have already said, what
is not remitted in this world is remitted in the next, that is,
they are not punished with the eternal punishment of the
world to come.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the temporary punishments of this life to which the human condition
is subject.</i></p>

<p>Quite exceptional are those who are not punished in this
life, but only afterwards. Yet that there have been some
who have reached the decrepitude of age without experiencing
even the slightest sickness, and who have had uninterrupted
enjoyment of life, I know both from report and from my own
observation. However, the very life we mortals lead is itself
all punishment, for it is all temptation, as the Scriptures
declare, where it is written, "Is not the life of man upon
earth a temptation?"<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> For ignorance is itself no slight
punishment, or want of culture, which it is with justice
thought so necessary to escape, that boys are compelled, under
pain of severe punishment, to learn trades or letters; and the
learning to which they are driven by punishment is itself so
much of a punishment to them, that they sometimes prefer the
pain that drives them to the pain to which they are driven by
it. And who would not shrink from the alternative, and
elect to die, if it were proposed to him either to suffer death
or to be again an infant? Our infancy, indeed, introducing
us to this life not with laughter but with tears, seems unconsciously
to predict the ills we are to encounter.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> Zoroaster
alone is said to have laughed when he was born, and that
unnatural omen portended no good to him. For he is said to
have been the inventor of magical arts, though indeed they
were unable to secure to him even the poor felicity of this
present life against the assaults of his enemies. For, himself
king of the Bactrians, he was conquered by Ninus king of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
Assyrians. In short, the words of Scripture, "An heavy yoke
is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of
their mother's womb till the day that they return to the
mother of all things,"<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>&mdash;these words so infallibly find fulfilment,
that even the little ones, who by the laver of regeneration
have been freed from the bond of original sin in which
alone they were held, yet suffer many ills, and in some instances
are even exposed to the assaults of evil spirits. But
let us not for a moment suppose that this suffering is prejudicial
to their future happiness, even though it has so increased
as to sever soul from body, and to terminate their life
in that early age.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>That everything which the grace of God does in the way of rescuing us from
the inveterate evils in which we are sunk, pertains to the future world, in
which all things are made new.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, in the "heavy yoke that is laid upon the
sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's
womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things,"
there is found an admirable though painful monitor teaching
us to be sober-minded, and convincing us that this life has
become penal in consequence of that outrageous wickedness
which was perpetrated in Paradise, and that all to which the
New Testament invites belongs to that future inheritance
which awaits us in the world to come, and is offered for our
acceptance, as the earnest that we may, in its own due time,
obtain that of which it is the pledge. Now, therefore, let us
walk in hope, and let us by the spirit mortify the deeds of
the flesh, and so make progress from day to day. For "the
Lord knoweth them that are His;"<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> and "as many as are
led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God,"<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> but by grace,
not by nature. For there is but one Son of God by nature,
who in His compassion became Son of man for our sakes, that
we, by nature sons of men, might by grace become through
Him sons of God. For He, abiding unchangeable, took upon
Him our nature, that thereby He might take us to Himself;
and, holding fast His own divinity, He became partaker of
our infirmity, that we, being changed into some better thing,
might, by participating in His righteousness and immortality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
lose our own properties of sin and mortality, and
preserve whatever good quality He had implanted in our
nature, perfected now by sharing in the goodness of His
nature. For as by the sin of one man we have fallen
into a misery so deplorable, so by the righteousness of one
Man, who also is God, shall we come to a blessedness inconceivably
exalted. Nor ought any one to trust that he has
passed from the one man to the other until he shall have reached
that place where there is no temptation, and have entered
into the peace which he seeks in the many and various conflicts
of this war, in which "the flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Now, such a war as
this would have had no existence, if human nature had, in
the exercise of free will, continued stedfast in the uprightness
in which it was created. But now in its misery it
makes war upon itself, because in its blessedness it would not
continue at peace with God; and this, though it be a miserable
calamity, is better than the earlier stages of this life,
which do not recognise that a war is to be maintained. For
better is it to contend with vices than without conflict to be
subdued by them. Better, I say, is war with the hope of
peace everlasting than captivity without any thought of deliverance.
We long, indeed, for the cessation of this war, and,
kindled by the flame of divine love, we burn for entrance on
that well-ordered peace in which whatever is inferior is for
ever subordinated to what is above it. But if (which God
forbid) there had been no hope of so blessed a consummation,
we should still have preferred to endure the hardness of this
conflict, rather than, by our non-resistance, to yield ourselves
to the dominion of vice.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>The laws of grace, which extend to all the epochs of the life of the regenerate.</i></p>

<p>But such is God's mercy towards the vessels of mercy
which He has prepared for glory, that even the first age of
man, that is, infancy, which submits without any resistance to
the flesh, and the second age, which is called boyhood, and
which has not yet understanding enough to undertake this
warfare, and therefore yields to almost every vicious pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
(because though this age has the power of speech,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> and may
therefore seem to have passed infancy, the mind is still too
weak to comprehend the commandment), yet if either of these
ages has received the sacraments of the Mediator, then, although
the present life be immediately brought to an end, the child,
having been translated from the power of darkness to the kingdom
of Christ, shall not only be saved from eternal punishments,
but shall not even suffer purgatorial torments after
death. For spiritual regeneration of itself suffices to prevent
any evil consequences resulting after death from the connection
with death which carnal generation forms.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> But when
we reach that age which can now comprehend the commandment,
and submit to the dominion of law, we must declare
war upon vices, and wage this war keenly, lest we be landed
in damnable sins. And if vices have not gathered strength,
by habitual victory they are more easily overcome and subdued;
but if they have been used to conquer and rule, it is
only with difficulty and labour they are mastered. And
indeed this victory cannot be sincerely and truly gained but
by delighting in true righteousness, and it is faith in Christ
that gives this. For if the law be present with its command,
and the Spirit be absent with His help, the presence of the
prohibition serves only to increase the desire to sin, and adds
the guilt of transgression. Sometimes, indeed, patent vices
are overcome by other and hidden vices, which are reckoned
virtues, though pride and a kind of ruinous self-sufficiency
are their informing principles. Accordingly vices are then
only to be considered overcome when they are conquered by
the love of God, which God Himself alone gives, and which
He gives only through the Mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus, who became a partaker of our mortality
that He might make us partakers of His divinity. But few
indeed are they who are so happy as to have passed their
youth without committing any damnable sins, either by dissolute
or violent conduct, or by following some godless and
unlawful opinions, but have subdued by their greatness of
soul everything in them which could make them the slaves of
carnal pleasures. The greater number having first become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
transgressors of the law that they have received, and having
allowed vice to have the ascendency in them, then flee to
grace for help, and so, by a penitence more bitter, and a struggle
more violent than it would otherwise have been, they subdue
the soul to God, and thus give it its lawful authority over
the flesh, and become victors. Whoever, therefore, desires to
escape eternal punishment, let him not only be baptized, but
also justified in Christ, and so let him in truth pass from the
devil to Christ. And let him not fancy that there are any
purgatorial pains except before that final and dreadful judgment.
We must not, however, deny that even the eternal
fire will be proportioned to the deserts of the wicked, so that
to some it will be more, and to others less painful, whether
this result be accomplished by a variation in the temperature
of the fire itself, graduated according to every one's merit, or
whether it be that the heat remains the same, but that all do
not feel it with equal intensity of torment.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of those who fancy that no men shall be punished eternally.</i></p>

<p>I must now, I see, enter the lists of amicable controversy
with those tender-hearted Christians who decline to believe
that any, or that all of those whom the infallibly just Judge
may pronounce worthy of the punishment of hell, shall suffer
eternally, and who suppose that they shall be delivered after
a fixed term of punishment, longer or shorter according to
the amount of each man's sin. In respect of this matter,
Origen was even more indulgent; for he believed that even
the devil himself and his angels, after suffering those more
severe and prolonged pains which their sins deserved, should
be delivered from their torments, and associated with the holy
angels. But the Church, not without reason, condemned him
for this and other errors, especially for his theory of the ceaseless
alternation of happiness and misery, and the interminable
transitions from the one state to the other at fixed periods of
ages; for in this theory he lost even the credit of being merciful,
by allotting to the saints real miseries for the expiation
of their sins, and false happiness, which brought them no true
and secure joy, that is, no fearless assurance of eternal blessedness.
Very different, however, is the error we speak of, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
is dictated by the tenderness of these Christians who suppose
that the sufferings of those who are condemned in the judgment
will be temporary, while the blessedness of all who are
sooner or later set free will be eternal. Which opinion, if it
is good and true because it is merciful, will be so much the
better and truer in proportion as it becomes more merciful.
Let, then, this fountain of mercy be extended, and flow forth
even to the lost angels, and let them also be set free, at least
after as many and long ages as seem fit! Why does this stream
of mercy flow to all the human race, and dry up as soon as
it reaches the angelic? And yet they dare not extend their
pity further, and propose the deliverance of the devil himself.
Or if any one is bold enough to do so, he does indeed put to
shame their charity, but is himself convicted of error that is more
unsightly, and a wresting of God's truth that is more perverse,
in proportion as his clemency of sentiment seems to be greater.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of those who fancy that, on account of the saints' intercession, no man shall
be damned in the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>There are others, again, with whose opinions I have become
acquainted in conversation, who, though they seem to reverence
the holy Scriptures, are yet of reprehensible life, and
who accordingly, in their own interest, attribute to God a still
greater compassion towards men. For they acknowledge that
it is truly predicted in the divine word that the wicked and
unbelieving are worthy of punishment, but they assert that,
when the judgment comes, mercy will prevail. For, say they,
God, having compassion on them, will give them up to the
prayers and intercessions of His saints. For if the saints
used to pray for them when they suffered from their cruel
hatred, how much more will they do so when they see them
prostrate and humble suppliants? For we cannot, they say,
believe that the saints shall lose their bowels of compassion
when they have attained the most perfect and complete holiness;
so that they who, when still sinners, prayed for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
enemies, should now, when they are freed from sin, withhold
from interceding for their suppliants. Or shall God refuse to
listen to so many of His beloved children, when their holiness
has purged their prayers of all hindrance to His answering
them? And the passage of the psalm which is cited by those
who admit that wicked men and infidels shall be punished for
a long time, though in the end delivered from all sufferings,
is claimed also by the persons we are now speaking of as
making much more for them. The verse runs: "Shall God
forget to be gracious? Shall He in anger shut up His tender
mercies?"<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> His anger, they say, would condemn all that are
unworthy of everlasting happiness to endless punishment.
But if He suffer them to be punished for a long time, or even
at all, must He not shut up His tender mercies, which the
Psalmist implies He will not do? For he does not say, Shall
He in anger shut up His tender mercies for a long period?
but he implies that He will not shut them up at all.</p>

<p>And they deny that thus God's threat of judgment is proved
to be false even though He condemn no man, any more than
we can say that His threat to overthrow Nineveh was false,
though the destruction which was absolutely predicted was
not accomplished. For He did not say, "Nineveh shall be
overthrown if they do not repent and amend their ways," but
without any such condition He foretold that the city should
be overthrown. And this prediction, they maintain, was true
because God predicted the punishment which they deserved,
although He was not to inflict it. For though He spared
them on their repentance, yet He was certainly aware that
they would repent, and, notwithstanding, absolutely and definitely
predicted that the city should be overthrown. This
was true, they say, in the truth of severity, because they were
worthy of it; but in respect of the compassion which checked
His anger, so that He spared the suppliants from the punishment
with which He had threatened the rebellious, it was not
true. If, then, He spared those whom His own holy prophet
was provoked at His sparing, how much more shall He spare
those more wretched suppliants for whom all His saints shall
intercede? And they suppose that this conjecture of theirs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
is not hinted at in Scripture, for the sake of stimulating many
to reformation of life through fear of very protracted or eternal
sufferings, and of stimulating others to pray for those who
have not reformed. However, they think that the divine
oracles are not altogether silent on this point; for they ask
to what purpose is it said, "How great is Thy goodness which
Thou hast hidden for them that fear Thee,"<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> if it be not to
teach us that the great and hidden sweetness of God's mercy
is concealed in order that men may fear? To the same purpose
they think the apostle said, "For God hath concluded
all men in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all,"<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
signifying that no one should be condemned by God. And
yet they who hold this opinion do not extend it to the acquittal
or liberation of the devil and his angels. Their human
tenderness is moved only towards men, and they plead chiefly
their own cause, holding out false hopes of impunity to their
own depraved lives by means of this quasi compassion of God
to the whole race. Consequently they who promise this impunity
even to the prince of the devils and his satellites make
a still fuller exhibition of the mercy of God.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of those who promise impunity from all sins even to heretics, through
virtue of their participation of the body of Christ.</i></p>

<p>So, too, there are others who promise this deliverance from
eternal punishment, not, indeed, to all men, but only to those
who have been washed in Christian baptism, and who become
partakers of the body of Christ, no matter how they have
lived, or what heresy or impiety they have fallen into. They
ground this opinion on the saying of Jesus, "This is the bread
which cometh down from heaven, that if any man eat thereof,
he shall not die. I am the living bread which came down
from heaven. If a man eat of this bread, he shall live for
ever."<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> Therefore, say they, it follows that these persons
must be delivered from death eternal, and at one time or other
be introduced to everlasting life.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>20. <i>Of those who promise this indulgence not to all, but only to those who have
been baptized as catholics, though afterwards they have broken out into
many crimes and heresies.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are others still who make this promise not even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
all who have received the sacraments of the baptism of Christ
and of His body, but only to the catholics, however badly
they have lived. For these have eaten the body of Christ,
not only sacramentally but really, being incorporated in His
body, as the apostle says, "We, being many, are one bread,
one body;"<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> so that, though they have afterwards lapsed into
some heresy, or even into heathenism and idolatry, yet by
virtue of this one thing, that they have received the baptism
of Christ, and eaten the body of Christ, in the body of Christ,
that is to say, in the catholic Church, they shall not die
eternally, but at one time or other obtain eternal life; and all
that wickedness of theirs shall not avail to make their punishment
eternal, but only proportionately long and severe.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>21. <i>Of those who assert that all catholics who continue in the faith, even though
by the depravity of their lives they have merited hell fire, shall be saved on
account of the "foundation" of their faith.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are some, too, who found upon the expression of
Scripture, "He that endureth to the end shall be saved,"<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> and
who promise salvation only to those who continue in the
Church catholic; and though such persons have lived badly,
yet, say they, they shall be saved as by fire through virtue of
the foundation of which the apostle says, "For other foundation
hath no man laid than that which is laid, which is Christ
Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work
shall be made manifest: for the day of the Lord shall declare
it, for it shall be revealed by fire; and each man's work
shall be proved of what sort it is. If any man's work shall
endure which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a
reward. But if any man's work shall be burned, he shall
suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through
fire."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> They say, accordingly, that the catholic Christian, no
matter what his life be, has Christ as his foundation, while
this foundation is not possessed by any heresy which is separated
from the unity of His body. And therefore, through
virtue of this foundation, even though the catholic Christian
by the inconsistency of his life has been as one building up
wood, hay, stubble, upon it, they believe that he shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
saved by fire, in other words, that he shall be delivered after
tasting the pain of that fire to which the wicked shall be condemned
at the last judgment.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Of those who fancy that the sins which are intermingled with alms-deeds
shall not be charged at the day of judgment.</i></p>

<p>I have also met with some who are of opinion that such
only as neglect to cover their sins with alms-deeds shall be
punished in everlasting fire; and they cite the words of the
Apostle James, "He shall have judgment without mercy who
hath shown no mercy."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> Therefore, say they, he who has
not amended his ways, but yet has intermingled his profligate
and wicked actions with works of mercy, shall receive mercy
in the judgment, so that he shall either quite escape condemnation,
or shall be liberated from his doom after some time
shorter or longer. They suppose that this was the reason
why the Judge Himself of quick and dead declined to mention
anything else than works of mercy done or omitted, when
awarding to those on His right hand life eternal, and to those
on His left everlasting punishment.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> To the same purpose,
they say, is the daily petition we make in the Lord's prayer,
"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> For, no
doubt, whoever pardons the person who has wronged him does
a charitable action. And this has been so highly commended
by the Lord Himself, that He says, "For if ye forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> And so it is to this kind
of alms-deeds that the saying of the Apostle James refers,
"He shall have judgment without mercy that hath shown no
mercy." And our Lord, they say, made no distinction of
great and small sins, but "Your Father will forgive your sins,
if ye forgive men theirs." Consequently they conclude that,
though a man has led an abandoned life up to the last day of
it, yet whatsoever his sins have been, they are all remitted by
virtue of this daily prayer, if only he has been mindful to
attend to this one thing, that when they who have done him
any injury ask his pardon, he forgive them from his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p>When, by God's help, I have replied to all these errors, I
shall conclude this (twenty-first) book.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Against those who are of opinion that the punishment neither of the devil nor
of wicked men shall be eternal.</i></p>

<p>First of all, it behoves us to inquire and to recognise why
the Church has not been able to tolerate the idea that promises
cleansing or indulgence to the devil even after the most severe
and protracted punishment. For so many holy men, imbued
with the spirit of the Old and New Testament, did not grudge
to angels of any rank or character that they should enjoy the
blessedness of the heavenly kingdom after being cleansed by
suffering, but rather they perceived that they could not invalidate
nor evacuate the divine sentence which the Lord
predicted that He would pronounce in the judgment, saying,
"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> For here it is evident that
the devil and his angels shall burn in everlasting fire. And
there is also that declaration in the Apocalypse, "The devil
their deceiver was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where also are the beast and the false prophet. And they
shall be tormented day and night for ever."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> In the former
passage "everlasting" is used, in the latter "for ever;" and
by these words Scripture is wont to mean nothing else than
endless duration. And therefore no other reason, no reason
more obvious and just, can be found for holding it as the fixed
and immovable belief of the truest piety, that the devil and
his angels shall never return to the justice and life of the
saints, than that Scripture, which deceives no man, says that
God spared them not, and that they were condemned beforehand
by Him, and cast into prisons of darkness in hell,<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> being
reserved to the judgment of the last day, when eternal fire
shall receive them, in which they shall be tormented world
without end. And if this be so, how can it be believed that
all men, or even some, shall be withdrawn from the endurance
of punishment after some time has been spent in it? how can
this be believed without enervating our faith in the eternal
punishment of the devils? For if all or some of those to
whom it shall be said, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,"<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> are not to
be always in that fire, then what reason is there for believing
that the devil and his angels shall always be there? Or is
perhaps the sentence of God, which is to be pronounced on
wicked men and angels alike, to be true in the case of the
angels, false in that of men? Plainly it will be so if the
conjectures of men are to weigh more than the word of God.
But because this is absurd, they who desire to be rid of eternal
punishment ought to abstain from arguing against God, and
rather, while yet there is opportunity, obey the divine commands.
Then what a fond fancy is it to suppose that eternal
punishment means long-continued punishment, while eternal
life means life without end, since Christ in the very same
passage spoke of both in similar terms in one and the same
sentence, "These shall go away into eternal punishment, but
the righteous into life eternal!"<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> If both destinies are
"eternal," then we must either understand both as long-continued
but at last terminating, or both as endless. For they
are correlative,&mdash;on the one hand, punishment eternal, on the
other hand, life eternal. And to say in one and the same
sense, life eternal shall be endless, punishment eternal shall
come to an end, is the height of absurdity. Wherefore, as
the eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal
punishment of those who are doomed to it shall have no end.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Against those who fancy that in the judgment of God all the accused will be
spared in virtue of the prayers of the saints.</i></p>

<p>And this reasoning is equally conclusive against those who,
in their own interest, but under the guise of a greater tenderness
of spirit, attempt to invalidate the words of God, and
who assert that these words are true, not because men shall
suffer those things which are threatened by God, but because
they deserve to suffer them. For God, they say, will yield
them to the prayers of His saints, who will then the more
earnestly pray for their enemies, as they shall be more perfect
in holiness, and whose prayers will be the more efficacious
and the more worthy of God's ear, because now purged from
all sin whatsoever. Why, then, if in that perfected holiness
their prayers be so pure and all-availing, will they not use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
them in behalf of the angels for whom eternal fire is prepared,
that God may mitigate His sentence and alter it, and extricate
them from that fire? Or will there, perhaps, be some one hardy
enough to affirm that even the holy angels will make common
cause with holy men (then become the equals of God's angels),
and will intercede for the guilty, both men and angels, that
mercy may spare them the punishment which truth has pronounced
them to deserve? But this has been asserted by no
one sound in the faith, nor will be. Otherwise there is no
reason why the Church should not even now pray for the
devil and his angels, since God her Master has ordered her
to pray for her enemies. The reason, then, which prevents
the Church from now praying for the wicked angels, whom
she knows to be her enemies, is the identical reason which
shall prevent her, however perfected in holiness, from praying
at the last judgment for those men who are to be punished in
eternal fire. At present she prays for her enemies among
men, because they have yet opportunity for fruitful repentance.
For what does she especially beg for them but that
"God would grant them repentance," as the apostle says,
"that they may return to soberness out of the snare of the
devil, by whom they are held captive according to his will?"<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
But if the Church were certified who those are, who, though
they are still abiding in this life, are yet predestinated to go
with the devil into eternal fire, then for them she could no
more pray than for him. But since she has this certainty
regarding no man, she prays for all her enemies who yet live
in this world; and yet she is not heard in behalf of all. But
she is heard in the case of those only who, though they oppose
the Church, are yet predestinated to become her sons through
her intercession. But if any retain an impenitent heart until
death, and are not converted from enemies into sons, does the
Church continue to pray for them, for the spirits, <i>i.e.</i>, of such
persons deceased? And why does she cease to pray for them,
unless because the man who was not translated into Christ's
kingdom while he was in the body, is now judged to be of
Satan's following?</p>

<p>It is then, I say, the same reason which prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Church at any time from praying for the wicked angels, which
prevents her from praying hereafter for those men who are to
be punished in eternal fire; and this also is the reason why,
though she prays even for the wicked so long as they live,
she yet does not even in this world pray for the unbelieving
and godless who are dead. For some of the dead, indeed, the
prayer of the Church or of pious individuals is heard; but it
is for those who, having been regenerated in Christ, did not
spend their life so wickedly that they can be judged unworthy
of such compassion, nor so well that they can be considered
to have no need of it. As also, after the resurrection, there
will be some of the dead to whom, after they have endured
the pains proper to the spirits of the dead, mercy shall be
accorded, and acquittal from the punishment of eternal fire.
For were there not some whose sins, though not remitted in
this life, shall be remitted in that which is to come, it could
not be truly said, "They shall not be forgiven, neither in this
world, neither in that which is to come."<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> But when the Judge
of quick and dead has said, "Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
the world," and to those on the other side, "Depart from me,
ye cursed, into the eternal fire, which is prepared for the
devil and his angels," and "These shall go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life,"<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> it were
excessively presumptuous to say that the punishment of any
of those whom God has said shall go away into eternal
punishment shall not be eternal, and so bring either despair
or doubt upon the corresponding promise of life eternal.</p>

<p>Let no man then so understand the words of the Psalmist,
"Shall God forget to be gracious? shall He shut up in His
anger His tender mercies?"<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> as if the sentence of God were
true of good men, false of bad men, or true of good men and
wicked angels, but false of bad men. For the Psalmist's words
refer to the vessels of mercy and the children of the promise,
of whom the prophet himself was one; for when he had said,
"Shall God forget to be gracious? shall He shut up in His
anger His tender mercies?" and then immediately subjoins,
"And I said, Now I begin: this is the change wrought by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
the right hand of the Most High,"<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> he manifestly explained
what he meant by the words, "Shall He shut up in His
anger His tender mercies?" For God's anger is this mortal
life, in which man is made like to vanity, and his days pass
as a shadow.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Yet in this anger God does not forget to be
gracious, causing His sun to shine and His rain to descend on
the just and the unjust;<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> and thus He does not in His anger
cut short His tender mercies, and especially in what the
Psalmist speaks of in the words, "Now I begin: this change
is from the right hand of the Most High;" for He changes for
the better the vessels of mercy, even while they are still in
this most wretched life, which is God's anger, and even while
His anger is manifesting itself in this miserable corruption;
for "in His anger He does not shut up His tender mercies."
And since the truth of this divine canticle is quite satisfied by
this application of it, there is no need to give it a reference to
that place in which those who do not belong to the city of God
are punished in eternal fire. But if any persist in extending
its application to the torments of the wicked, let them at least
understand it so that the anger of God, which has threatened
the wicked with eternal punishment, shall abide, but shall be
mixed with mercy to the extent of alleviating the torments
which might justly be inflicted; so that the wicked shall
neither wholly escape, nor only for a time endure these threatened
pains, but that they shall be less severe and more endurable
than they deserve. Thus the anger of God shall continue,
and at the same time He will not in this anger shut up His
tender mercies. But even this hypothesis I am not to be
supposed to affirm because I do not positively oppose it.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>As for those who find an empty threat rather than a truth
in such passages as these: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire;" and "These shall go away into eternal
punishment;"<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> and "They shall be tormented for ever and
ever;"<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> and "Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall
not be quenched,"<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>&mdash;such persons, I say, are most emphatically
and abundantly refuted, not by me so much as by the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
Scripture itself. For the men of Nineveh repented in this
life, and therefore their repentance was fruitful, inasmuch as
they sowed in that field which the Lord meant to be sown in
tears that it might afterwards be reaped in joy. And yet who
will deny that God's prediction was fulfilled in their case, if
at least he observes that God destroys sinners not only in
anger but also in compassion? For sinners are destroyed in
two ways,&mdash;either, like the Sodomites, the men themselves are
punished for their sins, or, like the Ninevites, the men's sins
are destroyed by repentance. God's prediction, therefore, was
fulfilled,&mdash;the wicked Nineveh was overthrown, and a good
Nineveh built up. For its walls and houses remained standing;
the city was overthrown in its depraved manners. And
thus, though the prophet was provoked that the destruction
which the inhabitants dreaded, because of his prediction, did
not take place, yet that which God's foreknowledge had predicted
did take place, for He who foretold the destruction
knew how it should be fulfilled in a less calamitous sense.</p>

<p>But that these perversely compassionate persons may see
what is the purport of these words, "How great is the abundance
of Thy sweetness, Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them
that fear Thee,"<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> let them read what follows: "And Thou hast
perfected it for them that hope in Thee." For what means,
"Thou hast hidden it for them that fear Thee," "Thou hast
perfected it for them that hope in Thee," unless this, that to
those who through fear of punishment seek to establish their
own righteousness by the law, the righteousness of God is not
sweet, because they are ignorant of it? They have not tasted
it. For they hope in themselves, not in Him; and therefore
God's abundant sweetness is hidden from them. They fear
God, indeed, but it is with that servile fear "which is not in
love; for perfect love casteth out fear."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> Therefore to them
that hope in Him He perfecteth His sweetness, inspiring them
with His own love, so that with a holy fear, which love does
not cast out, but which endureth for ever, they may, when
they glory, glory in the Lord. For the righteousness of God
is Christ, "who is of God made unto us," as the apostle says,
"wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> This righteousness of God, which is the gift of grace
without merits, is not known by those who go about to establish
their own righteousness, and are therefore not subject to
the righteousness of God, which is Christ.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> But it is in this
righteousness that we find the great abundance of God's sweetness,
of which the psalm says, "Taste and see how sweet the
Lord is."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> And this we rather taste than partake of to satiety
in this our pilgrimage. We hunger and thirst for it now, that
hereafter we may be satisfied with it when we see Him as He
is, and that is fulfilled which is written, "I shall be satisfied
when Thy glory shall be manifested."<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> It is thus that Christ
perfects the great abundance of His sweetness to them that
hope in Him. But if God conceals His sweetness from them
that fear Him in the sense that these our objectors fancy, so that
men's ignorance of His purpose of mercy towards the wicked
may lead them to fear Him and live better, and so that there
may be prayer made for those who are not living as they
ought, how then does He perfect His sweetness to them that
hope in Him, since, if their dreams be true, it is this very
sweetness which will prevent Him from punishing those who
do not hope in Him? Let us then seek that sweetness of His,
which He perfects to them that hope in Him, not that which
He is supposed to perfect to those who despise and blaspheme
Him; for in vain, after this life, does a man seek for what he
has neglected to provide while in this life.</p>

<p>Then, as to that saying of the apostle, "For God hath concluded
all in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all,"<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
it does not mean that He will condemn no one; but the foregoing
context shows what is meant. The apostle composed
the epistle for the Gentiles who were already believers; and
when he was speaking to them of the Jews who were yet to
believe, he says, "For as ye in times past believed not God,
yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even
so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy
they also may obtain mercy." Then he added the words in
question with which these persons beguile themselves: "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
God concluded all in unbelief, that He might have mercy
upon all." All whom, if not all those of whom he was speaking,
just as if he had said, "Both you and them?" God then
concluded all those in unbelief, both Jews and Gentiles, whom
He foreknew and predestinated to be conformed to the image
of His Son, in order that they might be confounded by the
bitterness of unbelief, and might repent and believingly turn
to the sweetness of God's mercy, and might take up that
exclamation of the psalm, "How great is the abundance of
Thy sweetness, O Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them that
fear Thee, but hast perfected to them that hope," not in themselves,
but "in Thee." He has mercy, then, on all the vessels
of mercy. And what means "all?" Both those of the
Gentiles and those of the Jews whom He predestinated, called,
justified, glorified: none of these will be condemned by Him;
but we cannot say none of all men whatever.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>Whether those who received heretical baptism, and have afterwards fallen
away to wickedness of life; or those who have received catholic baptism,
but have afterwards passed over to heresy and schism; or those who have
remained in the catholic Church in which they were baptized, but have
continued to live immorally,&mdash;may hope through the virtue of the sacraments
for the remission of eternal punishment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But let us now reply to those who promise deliverance
from eternal fire, not to the devil and his angels (as neither
do they of whom we have been speaking), nor even to all
men whatever, but only to those who have been washed by
the baptism of Christ, and have become partakers of His body
and blood, no matter how they have lived, no matter what
heresy or impiety they have fallen into. But they are contradicted
by the apostle, where he says, "Now the works of
the flesh are manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variances,
emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness,
revellings, and the like: of the which I tell you before, as I
have also told you in time past, for they which do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Certainly
this sentence of the apostle is false, if such persons shall be
delivered after any lapse of time, and shall then inherit the
kingdom of God. But as it is not false, they shall certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
never inherit the kingdom of God. And if they shall never
enter that kingdom, then they shall always be retained in
eternal punishment; for there is no middle place where he
may live unpunished who has not been admitted into that
kingdom.</p>

<p>And therefore we may reasonably inquire how we are to
understand these words of the Lord Jesus: "This is the bread
which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
and not die. I am the living bread which came down from
heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever."<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
And those, indeed, whom we are now answering, are refuted
in their interpretation of this passage by those whom we are
shortly to answer, and who do not promise this deliverance to
all who have received the sacraments of baptism and the
Lord's body, but only to the catholics, however wickedly they
live; for these, say they, have eaten the Lord's body not only
sacramentally, but really, being constituted members of His
body, of which the apostle says, "We being many are one
bread, one body."<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> He then who is in the unity of Christ's
body (that is to say, in the Christian membership), of which
body the faithful have been wont to receive the sacrament at
the altar, that man is truly said to eat the body and drink
the blood of Christ. And consequently heretics and schismatics
being separate from the unity of this body, are able
to receive the same sacrament, but with no profit to themselves,&mdash;nay,
rather to their own hurt, so that they are rather
more severely judged than liberated after some time. For
they are not in that bond of peace which is symbolized by
that sacrament.</p>

<p>But again, even those who sufficiently understand that he
who is not in the body of Christ cannot be said to eat the
body of Christ, are in error when they promise liberation
from the fire of eternal punishment to persons who fall away
from the unity of that body into heresy, or even into heathenish
superstition. For, in the first place, they ought to consider
how intolerable it is, and how discordant with sound
doctrine, to suppose that many, indeed, or almost all, who
have forsaken the Church catholic, and have originated impious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
heresies and become heresiarchs, should enjoy a destiny
superior to those who never were catholics, but have fallen
into the snares of these others; that is to say, if the fact of
their catholic baptism and original reception of the sacrament
of the body of Christ in the true body of Christ is sufficient
to deliver these heresiarchs from eternal punishment. For
certainly he who deserts the faith, and from a deserter becomes
an assailant, is worse than he who has not deserted the
faith he never held. And, in the second place, they are contradicted
by the apostle, who, after enumerating the works
of the flesh, says with reference to heresies, "They who do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>And therefore neither ought such persons as lead an
abandoned and damnable life to be confident of salvation,
though they persevere to the end in the communion of the
Church catholic, and comfort themselves with the words, "He
that endureth to the end shall be saved." By the iniquity of
their life they abandon that very righteousness of life which
Christ is to them, whether it be by fornication, or by perpetrating
in their body the other uncleannesses which the apostle would
not so much as mention, or by a dissolute luxury, or by doing
any one of those things of which he says, "They who do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Consequently,
they who do such things shall not exist anywhere but in
eternal punishment, since they cannot be in the kingdom of
God. For, while they continue in such things to the very
end of life, they cannot be said to abide in Christ to the end;
for to abide in Him is to abide in the faith of Christ. And
this faith, according to the apostle's definition of it, "worketh
by love."<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> And "love," as he elsewhere says, "worketh no
evil."<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> Neither can these persons be said to eat the body of
Christ, for they cannot even be reckoned among His members.
For, not to mention other reasons, they cannot be at once the
members of Christ and the members of a harlot. In fine, He
Himself, when He says, "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh
my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,"<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> shows what it is
in reality, and not sacramentally, to eat His body and drink
His blood; for this is to dwell in Christ, that He also may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
dwell in us. So that it is as if He said, He that dwelleth
not in me, and in whom I do not dwell, let him not say or
think that he eateth my body or drinketh my blood. Accordingly,
they who are not Christ's members do not dwell in
Him. And they who make themselves members of a harlot,
are not members of Christ unless they have penitently abandoned
that evil, and have returned to this good to be reconciled
to it.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>What it is to have Christ for a foundation, and who they are to whom
salvation as by fire is promised.</i></p>

<p>But, say they, the catholic Christians have Christ for a
foundation, and they have not fallen away from union with
Him, no matter how depraved a life they have built on this
foundation, as wood, hay, stubble; and accordingly the well-directed
faith by which Christ is their foundation will suffice
to deliver them some time from the continuance of that fire,
though it be with loss, since those things they have built on
it shall be burned. Let the Apostle James summarily reply
to them: "If any man say he has faith, and have not works,
can faith save him?"<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> And who then is it, they ask, of
whom the Apostle Paul says, "But he himself shall be saved,
yet so as by fire?"<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Let us join them in their inquiry; and
one thing is very certain, that it is not he of whom James
speaks, else we should make the two apostles contradict one
another, if the one says, "Though a man's works be evil, his
faith will save him as by fire," while the other says, "If he
have not good works, can his faith save him?"</p>

<p>We shall then ascertain who it is who can be saved by
fire, if we first discover what it is to have Christ for a foundation.
And this we may very readily learn from the image
itself. In a building the foundation is first. Whoever, then,
has Christ in his heart, so that no earthly or temporal things&mdash;not
even those that are legitimate and allowed&mdash;are preferred
to Him, has Christ as a foundation. But if these
things be preferred, then even though a man seem to have faith
in Christ, yet Christ is not the foundation to that man; and
much more if he, in contempt of wholesome precepts, seek
forbidden gratifications, is he clearly convicted of putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Christ not first but last, since he has despised Him as his
ruler, and has preferred to fulfil his own wicked lusts, in contempt
of Christ's commands and allowances. Accordingly, if
any Christian man loves a harlot, and, attaching himself to
her, becomes one body, he has not now Christ for a foundation.
But if any one loves his own wife, and loves her as Christ would
have him love her, who can doubt that he has Christ for a
foundation? But if he loves her in the world's fashion, carnally,
as the disease of lust prompts him, and as the Gentiles
love who know not God, even this the apostle, or rather
Christ by the apostle, allows as a venial fault. And therefore
even such a man may have Christ for a foundation. For
so long as he does not prefer such an affection or pleasure to
Christ, Christ is his foundation, though on it he builds wood,
hay, stubble; and therefore he shall be saved as by fire. For
the fire of affliction shall burn such luxurious pleasures and
earthly loves, though they be not damnable, because enjoyed
in lawful wedlock. And of this fire the fuel is bereavement,
and all those calamities which consume these joys. Consequently
the superstructure will be loss to him who has built
it, for he shall not retain it, but shall be agonized by the loss
of those things in the enjoyment of which he found pleasure.
But by this fire he shall be saved through virtue of the foundation,
because even if a persecutor demanded whether he
would retain Christ or these things, he would prefer Christ.
Would you hear, in the apostle's own words, who he is who
builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones? "He
that is unmarried," he says, "careth for the things that
belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Would
you hear who he is that buildeth wood, hay, stubble? "But
he that is married careth for the things that are of the world,
how he may please his wife."<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> "Every man's work shall be
made manifest: for the day shall declare it,"&mdash;the day, no
doubt, of tribulation&mdash;"because," says he, "it shall be revealed
by fire."<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> He calls tribulation fire, just as it is elsewhere
said, "The furnace proves the vessels of the potter, and
the trial of affliction righteous men."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> And "The fire shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work
abide"&mdash;for a man's care for the things of the Lord, how he
may please the Lord, abides&mdash;"which he hath built thereupon,
he shall receive a reward,"&mdash;that is, he shall reap the
fruit of his care. "But if any man's work shall be burned,
he shall suffer loss,"&mdash;for what he loved he shall not retain:&mdash;"but
he himself shall be saved,"&mdash;for no tribulation shall
have moved him from that stable foundation,&mdash;"yet so as by
fire;"<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> for that which he possessed with the sweetness of
love he does not lose without the sharp sting of pain. Here,
then, as seems to me, we have a fire which destroys neither,
but enriches the one, brings loss to the other, proves both.</p>

<p>But if this passage [of Corinthians] is to interpret that
fire of which the Lord shall say to those on His left hand,
"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,"<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> so that
among these we are to believe there are those who build on
the foundation wood, hay, stubble, and that they, through
virtue of the good foundation, shall after a time be liberated
from the fire that is the award of their evil deserts, what
then shall we think of those on the right hand, to whom it
shall be said, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you,"<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> unless that they are those who
have built on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones?
But if the fire of which our Lord speaks is the same as that
of which the apostle says, "Yet so as by fire," then both&mdash;that
is to say, both those on the right as well as those on the
left&mdash;are to be cast into it. For that fire is to try both,
since it is said, "For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every
man's work of what sort it is."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> If, therefore, the fire shall
try both, in order that if any man's work abide&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> if the
superstructure be not consumed by the fire&mdash;he may receive
a reward, and that if his work is burned he may suffer loss,
certainly that fire is not the eternal fire itself. For into
this latter fire only those on the left hand shall be cast, and
that with final and everlasting doom; but that former fire
proves those on the right hand. But some of them it so
proves that it does not burn and consume the structure which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
is found to have been built by them on Christ as the foundation;
while others of them it proves in another fashion, so as
to burn what they have built up, and thus cause them to
suffer loss, while they themselves are saved because they have
retained Christ, who was laid as their sure foundation, and
have loved Him above all. But if they are saved, then certainly
they shall stand at the right hand, and shall with the
rest hear the sentence, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you;" and not at the left
hand, where those shall be who shall not be saved, and shall
therefore hear the doom, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire." For from that fire no man shall be saved,
because they all shall go away into eternal punishment, where
their worms shall not die, nor their fire be quenched, in which
they shall be tormented day and night for ever.</p>

<p>But if it be said that in the interval of time between the
death of this body and that last day of judgment and retribution
which shall follow the resurrection, the bodies of the
dead shall be exposed to a fire of such a nature that it shall
not affect those who have not in this life indulged in such
pleasures and pursuits as shall be consumed like wood, hay,
stubble, but shall affect those others who have carried with
them structures of that kind; if it be said that such worldliness,
being venial, shall be consumed in the fire of tribulation
either here only, or here and hereafter both, or here that it may
not be hereafter,&mdash;this I do not contradict, because possibly
it is true. For perhaps even the death of the body is itself
a part of this tribulation, for it results from the first transgression,
so that the time which follows death takes its colour
in each case from the nature of the man's building. The
persecutions, too, which have crowned the martyrs, and which
Christians of all kinds suffer, try both buildings like a fire,
consuming some, along with the builders themselves, if Christ
is not found in them as their foundation, while others they
consume without the builders, because Christ is found in
them, and they are saved, though with loss; and other buildings
still they do not consume, because such materials as
abide for ever are found in them. In the end of the world
there shall be in the time of Antichrist tribulation such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
has never before been. How many edifices there shall then be,
of gold or of hay, built on the best foundation, Christ Jesus,
which that fire shall prove, bringing joy to some, loss to
others, but without destroying either sort, because of this
stable foundation! But whosoever prefers, I do not say his
wife, with whom he lives for carnal pleasure, but any of those
relatives who afford no delight of such a kind, and whom it
is right to love,&mdash;whosoever prefers these to Christ, and loves
them after a human and carnal fashion, has not Christ as a
foundation, and will therefore not be saved by fire, nor indeed
at all; for he shall not possibly dwell with the Saviour, who
says very explicitly concerning this very matter, "He that loveth
father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he
that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of
me."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> But he who loves his relations carnally, and yet so that
he does not prefer them to Christ, but would rather want them
than Christ if he were put to the proof, shall be saved by fire,
because it is necessary that by the loss of these relations he
suffer pain in proportion to his love. And he who loves
father, mother, sons, daughters, according to Christ, so that
he aids them in obtaining His kingdom and cleaving to Him,
or loves them because they are members of Christ, God forbid
that this love should be consumed as wood, hay, stubble, and
not rather be reckoned a structure of gold, silver, precious
stones. For how can a man love those more than Christ
whom he loves only for Christ's sake?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Against the belief of those who think that the sins which have been accompanied
with almsgiving will do them no harm.</i></p>

<p>It remains to reply to those who maintain that those only
shall burn in eternal fire who neglect alms-deeds proportioned
to their sins, resting this opinion on the words of the
Apostle James, "He shall have judgment without mercy that
hath showed no mercy."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Therefore, they say, he that hath
showed mercy, though he has not reformed his dissolute conduct,
but has lived wickedly and iniquitously even while
abounding in alms, shall have a merciful judgment, so that he
shall either be not condemned at all, or shall be delivered
from final judgment after a time. And for the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
they suppose that Christ will discriminate between those on
the right hand and those on the left, and will send the one
party into His kingdom, the other into eternal punishment, on
the sole ground of their attention to or neglect of works of
charity. Moreover, they endeavour to use the prayer which
the Lord Himself taught as a proof and bulwark of their
opinion, that daily sins which are never abandoned can be
expiated through alms-deeds, no matter how offensive or of
what sort they be. For, say they, as there is no day on
which Christians ought not to use this prayer, so there is no
sin of any kind which, though committed every day, is not
remitted when we say, "Forgive us our debts," if we take
care to fulfil what follows, "as we forgive our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> For,
they go on to say, the Lord does not say, "If ye forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you your
little daily sins," but "will forgive you your sins." Therefore,
be they of any kind or magnitude whatever, be they perpetrated
daily and never abandoned or subdued in this life,
they can be pardoned, they presume, through alms-deeds.</p>

<p>But they are right to inculcate the giving of alms proportioned
to past sins; for if they said that any kind of alms
could obtain the divine pardon of great sins committed daily
and with habitual enormity, if they said that such sins could
thus be daily remitted, they would see that their doctrine
was absurd and ridiculous. For they would thus be driven
to acknowledge that it were possible for a very wealthy man
to buy absolution from murders, adulteries, and all manner of
wickedness, by paying a daily alms of ten paltry coins. And
if it be most absurd and insane to make such an acknowledgment,
and if we still ask what are those fitting alms of
which even the forerunner of Christ said, "Bring forth therefore
fruits meet for repentance,"<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> undoubtedly it will be found
that they are not such as are done by men who undermine
their life by daily enormities even to the very end. For
they suppose that by giving to the poor a small fraction
of the wealth they acquire by extortion and spoliation they
can propitiate Christ, so that they may with impunity
commit the most damnable sins, in the persuasion that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
have bought from Him a licence to transgress, or rather
do buy a daily indulgence. And if they for one crime have
distributed all their goods to Christ's needy members, that
could profit them nothing unless they desisted from all similar
actions, and attained charity which worketh no evil. He
therefore who does alms-deeds proportioned to his sins must
first begin with himself. For it is not reasonable that a man
who exercises charity towards his neighbour should not do so
towards himself, since he hears the Lord saying, "Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself,"<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> and again, "Have compassion
on thy soul, and please God."<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> He then who has not compassion
on his own soul that he may please God, how can he
be said to do alms-deeds proportioned to his sins? To the
same purpose is that written, "He who is bad to himself, to
whom can he be good?"<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> We ought therefore to do alms
that we may be heard when we pray that our past sins may
be forgiven, not that while we continue in them we may
think to provide ourselves with a licence for wickedness by
alms-deeds.</p>

<p>The reason, therefore, of our predicting that He will impute
to those on His right hand the alms-deeds they have
done, and charge those on His left with omitting the same, is
that He may thus show the efficacy of charity for the deletion
of past sins, not for impunity in their perpetual commission.
And such persons, indeed, as decline to abandon their evil
habits of life for a better course cannot be said to do charitable
deeds. For this is the purport of the saying, "Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it
not to me."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> He shows them that they do not perform
charitable actions even when they think they are doing so.
For if they gave bread to a hungering Christian because he is
a Christian, assuredly they would not deny to themselves the
bread of righteousness, that is, Christ Himself; for God considers
not the person to whom the gift is made, but the spirit
in which it is made. He therefore who loves Christ in a
Christian extends alms to him in the same spirit in which he
draws near to Christ, not in that spirit which would abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
Christ if it could do so with impunity. For in proportion as
a man loves what Christ disapproves does he himself abandon
Christ. For what does it profit a man that he is baptized, if
he is not justified? Did not He who said, "Except a man
be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the
kingdom of God,"<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> say also, "Except your righteousness shall
exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven?"<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> Why do many
through fear of the first saying run to baptism, while few
through fear of the second seek to be justified? As therefore
it is not to his brother a man says, "Thou fool," if when he
says it he is indignant not at the brotherhood, but at the sin
of the offender,&mdash;for otherwise he were guilty of hell fire,&mdash;so
he who extends charity to a Christian does not extend it
to a Christian if he does not love Christ in him. Now he
does not love Christ who refuses to be justified in Him. Or,
again, if a man has been guilty of this sin of calling his
brother Fool, unjustly reviling him without any desire to
remove his sin, his alms-deeds go a small way towards expiating
this fault, unless he adds to this the remedy of reconciliation
which the same passage enjoins. For it is there said,
"Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave
there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> Just
so it is a small matter to do alms-deeds, no matter how great
they be, for any sin, so long as the offender continues in the
practice of sin.</p>

<p>Then as to the daily prayer which the Lord Himself taught,
and which is therefore called the Lord's prayer, it obliterates
indeed the sins of the day, when day by day we say, "Forgive
us our debts," and when we not only say but act out that
which follows, "as we forgive our debtors;"<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> but we utter
this petition because sins have been committed, and not that
they may be. For by it our Saviour designed to teach us
that, however righteously we live in this life of infirmity and
darkness, we still commit sins for the remission of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
ought to pray, while we must pardon those who sin against
us that we ourselves also may be pardoned. The Lord then
did not utter the words, "If ye forgive men their trespasses,
your Father will also forgive you your trespasses,"<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> in order
that we might contract from this petition such confidence as
should enable us to sin securely from day to day, either putting
ourselves above the fear of human laws, or craftily deceiving
men concerning our conduct, but in order that we
might thus learn not to suppose that we are without sins,
even though we should be free from crimes; as also God
admonished the priests of the old law to this same effect
regarding their sacrifices, which He commanded them to offer
first for their own sins, and then for the sins of the people.
For even the very words of so great a Master and Lord are to
be intently considered. For He does not say, If ye forgive
men their sins, your Father will also forgive you your sins, no
matter of what sort they be, but He says, your sins; for it
was a daily prayer He was teaching, and it was certainly to
disciples already justified He was speaking. What, then,
does He mean by "your sins," but those sins from which not
even you who are justified and sanctified can be free? While,
then, those who seek occasion from this petition to indulge in
habitual sin maintain that the Lord meant to include great
sins, because He did not say, He will forgive you your small
sins, but "your sins," we, on the other hand, taking into
account the character of the persons He was addressing, cannot
see our way to interpret the expression "your sins" of
anything but small sins, because such persons are no longer
guilty of great sins. Nevertheless not even great sins themselves&mdash;sins
from which we must flee with a total reformation
of life&mdash;are forgiven to those who pray, unless they observe
the appended precept, "as ye also forgive your debtors." For
if the very small sins which attach even to the life of the
righteous be not remitted without that condition, how much
further from obtaining indulgence shall those be who are involved
in many great crimes, if, while they cease from perpetrating
such enormities, they still inexorably refuse to remit
any debt incurred to themselves, since the Lord says, "But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses?"<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> For this is the purport of the saying
of the Apostle James also, "He shall have judgment without
mercy that hath showed no mercy."<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> For we should
remember that servant whose debt of ten thousand talents his
lord cancelled, but afterwards ordered him to pay up, because
the servant himself had no pity for his fellow-servant who
owed him an hundred pence.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> The words which the Apostle
James subjoins, "And mercy rejoiceth against judgment,"<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>
find their application among those who are the children of the
promise and vessels of mercy. For even those righteous men,
who have lived with such holiness that they receive into
the eternal habitations others also who have won their friendship
with the mammon of unrighteousness,<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> became such only
through the merciful deliverance of Him who justifies the
ungodly, imputing to him a reward according to grace, not
according to debt. For among this number is the apostle,
who says, "I obtained mercy to be faithful."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p>But it must be admitted, that those who are thus received
into the eternal habitations are not of such a character that
their own life would suffice to rescue them without the aid of
the saints, and consequently in their case especially does mercy
rejoice against judgment. And yet we are not on this account
to suppose that every abandoned profligate, who has made
no amendment of his life, is to be received into the eternal
habitations if only he has assisted the saints with the mammon
of unrighteousness,&mdash;that is to say, with money or wealth
which has been unjustly acquired, or, if rightfully acquired, is
yet not the true riches, but only what iniquity counts riches,
because it knows not the true riches in which those persons
abound, who even receive others also into eternal habitations.
There is then a certain kind of life, which is neither, on the
one hand, so bad that those who adopt it are not helped
towards the kingdom of heaven by any bountiful almsgiving
by which they may relieve the wants of the saints, and make
friends who could receive them into eternal habitations, nor,
on the other hand, so good that it of itself suffices to win for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
them that great blessedness, if they do not obtain mercy
through the merits of those whom they have made their friends.
And I frequently wonder that even Virgil should give expression
to this sentence of the Lord, in which He says, "Make
to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that
they may receive you into everlasting habitations;"<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> and this
very similar saying, "He that receiveth a prophet, in the
name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he
that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous
man, shall receive a righteous man's reward."<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> For when that
poet described the Elysian fields, in which they suppose that
the souls of the blessed dwell, he placed there not only those
who had been able by their own merit to reach that abode,
but added,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And they who grateful memory won<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By services to others done;"<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that is, they who had served others, and thereby merited to
be remembered by them. Just as if they used the expression
so common in Christian lips, where some humble person commends
himself to one of the saints, and says, Remember me,
and secures that he do so by deserving well at his hand. But
what that kind of life we have been speaking of is, and what
those sins are which prevent a man from winning the kingdom
of God by himself, but yet permit him to avail himself
of the merits of the saints, it is very difficult to ascertain,
very perilous to define. For my own part, in spite of all
investigation, I have been up to the present hour unable to
discover this. And possibly it is hidden from us, lest we
should become careless in avoiding such sins, and so cease to
make progress. For if it were known what these sins are,
which, though they continue, and be not abandoned for a
higher life, do yet not prevent us from seeking and hoping
for the intercession of the saints, human sloth would presumptuously
wrap itself in these sins, and would take no steps to
be disentangled from such wrappings by the deft energy of
any virtue, but would only desire to be rescued by the merits
of other people, whose friendship had been won by a bountiful
use of the mammon of unrighteousness. But now that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
are left in ignorance of the precise nature of that iniquity
which is venial, even though it be persevered in, certainly we
are both more vigilant in our prayers and efforts for progress,
and more careful to secure with the mammon of unrighteousness
friends for ourselves among the saints.</p>

<p>But this deliverance, which is effected by one's own prayers,
or the intercession of holy men, secures that a man be not cast
into eternal fire, but not that, when once he has been cast into
it, he should after a time be rescued from it. For even those
who fancy that what is said of the good ground bringing forth
abundant fruit, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred fold,
is to be referred to the saints, so that in proportion to their
merits some of them shall deliver thirty men, some sixty,
some an hundred,&mdash;even those who maintain this are yet
commonly inclined to suppose that this deliverance will take
place at, and not after the day of judgment. Under this impression,
some one who observed the unseemly folly with which
men promise themselves impunity on the ground that all will
be included in this method of deliverance, is reported to have
very happily remarked, that we should rather endeavour to live
so well that we shall be all found among the number of those
who are to intercede for the liberation of others, lest these
should be so few in number, that, after they have delivered,
one thirty, another sixty, another a hundred, there should still
remain many who could not be delivered from punishment by
their intercessions, and among them every one who has vainly
and rashly promised himself the fruit of another's labour. But
enough has been said in reply to those who acknowledge the
authority of the same sacred Scriptures as ourselves, but who,
by a mistaken interpretation of them, conceive of the future
rather as they themselves wish, than as the Scriptures teach.
And having given this reply, I now, according to promise,
close this book.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Of the creation of angels and men.</i></p>

<p>As we promised in the immediately preceding book, this,
the last of the whole work, shall contain a discussion
of the eternal blessedness of the city of God. This blessedness
is named eternal, not because it shall endure for many
ages, though at last it shall come to an end, but because,
according to the words of the gospel, "of His kingdom there
shall be no end."<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> Neither shall it enjoy the mere appearance
of perpetuity which is maintained by the rise of fresh
generations to occupy the place of those that have died out, as
in an evergreen the same freshness seems to continue permanently,
and the same appearance of dense foliage is preserved
by the growth of fresh leaves in the room of those that have
withered and fallen; but in that city all the citizens shall be
immortal, men now for the first time enjoying what the holy
angels have never lost. And this shall be accomplished by
God, the most almighty Founder of the city. For He has
promised it, and cannot lie, and has already performed many
of His promises, and has done many unpromised kindnesses
to those whom He now asks to believe that He will do this
also.</p>

<p>For it is He who in the beginning created the world full
of all visible and intelligible beings, among which He created
nothing better than those spirits whom He endowed with intelligence,
and made capable of contemplating and enjoying Him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
and united in our society, which we call the holy and heavenly
city, and in which the material of their sustenance and blessedness
is God Himself, as it were their common food and nourishment.
It is He who gave to this intellectual nature free-will
of such a kind, that if he wished to forsake God his blessedness,
misery should forthwith result. It is He who, when
He foreknew that certain angels would in their pride desire
to suffice for their own blessedness, and would forsake their
great good, did not deprive them of this power, deeming it to
be more befitting His power and goodness to bring good out
of evil than to prevent the evil from coming into existence.
And indeed evil had never been, had not the mutable nature&mdash;mutable,
though good, and created by the most high God
and immutable Good, who created all things good&mdash;brought
evil upon itself by sin. And this its sin is itself proof that
its nature was originally good. For had it not been very good,
though not equal to its Creator, the desertion of God as its
light could not have been an evil to it. For as blindness is
a vice of the eye, and this very fact indicates that the eye
was created to see the light, and as, consequently, vice itself
proves that the eye is more excellent than the other members,
because it is capable of light (for on no other supposition
would it be a vice of the eye to want light), so the nature
which once enjoyed God teaches, even by its very vice, that
it was created the best of all, since it is now miserable because
it does not enjoy God. It is He who with very just punishment
doomed the angels who voluntarily fell to everlasting
misery, and rewarded those who continued in their attachment
to the supreme good with the assurance of endless stability
as the meed of their fidelity. It is He who made also man
himself upright, with the same freedom of will,&mdash;an earthly
animal, indeed, but fit for heaven if he remained faithful to
his Creator, but destined to the misery appropriate to such a
nature if he forsook Him. It is He who, when He foreknew
that man would in his turn sin by abandoning God and
breaking His law, did not deprive him of the power of free-will,
because He at the same time foresaw what good He
Himself would bring out of the evil, and how from this
mortal race, deservedly and justly condemned, He would by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
His grace collect, as now He does, a people so numerous, that
He thus fills up and repairs the blank made by the fallen
angels, and that thus that beloved and heavenly city is not
defrauded of the full number of its citizens, but perhaps may
even rejoice in a still more overflowing population.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the eternal and unchangeable will of God.</i></p>

<p>It is true that wicked men do many things contrary to God's
will; but so great is His wisdom and power, that all things
which seem adverse to His purpose do still tend towards those
just and good ends and issues which He Himself has foreknown.
And consequently, when God is said to change His
will, as when, <i>e.g.</i>, He becomes angry with those to whom He
was gentle, it is rather they than He who are changed, and
they find Him changed in so far as their experience of suffering
at His hand is new, as the sun is changed to injured eyes, and
becomes as it were fierce from being mild, and hurtful from
being delightful, though in itself it remains the same as it
was. That also is called the will of God which He does in
the hearts of those who obey His commandments; and of this
the apostle says, "For it is God that worketh in you both
to will."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> As God's "righteousness" is used not only of the
righteousness wherewith He Himself is righteous, but also of
that which He produces in the man whom He justifies, so also
that is called His law, which, though given by God, is rather
the law of men. For certainly they were men to whom Jesus
said, "It is written in your law,"<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> though in another place
we read, "The law of his God is in his heart."<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> According
to this will which God works in men, He is said also to will
what He Himself does not will, but causes His people to will;
as He is said to know what He has caused those to know who
were ignorant of it. For when the apostle says, "But now,
after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,"<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
we cannot suppose that God there for the first time knew
those who were foreknown by Him before the foundation of
the world; but He is said to have known them then, because
then He caused them to know. But I remember that I discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
these modes of expression in the preceding books.
According to this will, then, by which we say that God wills
what He causes to be willed by others, from whom the future
is hidden, He wills many things which He does not perform.</p>

<p>Thus His saints, inspired by His holy will, desire many
things which never happen. They pray, <i>e.g.</i>, for certain individuals&mdash;they
pray in a pious and holy manner&mdash;but what
they request He does not perform, though He Himself by His
own Holy Spirit has wrought in them this will to pray. And
consequently, when the saints, in conformity with God's mind,
will and pray that all men be saved, we can use this mode of
expression: God wills and does not perform,&mdash;meaning that
He who causes them to will these things Himself wills them.
But if we speak of that will of His which is eternal as His
foreknowledge, certainly He has already done all things in
heaven and on earth that He has willed,&mdash;not only past and
present things, but even things still future. But before the
arrival of that time in which He has willed the occurrence of
what He foreknew and arranged before all time, we say, It
will happen when God wills. But if we are ignorant not
only of the time in which it is to be, but even whether it shall
be at all, we say, It will happen if God wills,&mdash;not because
God will then have a new will which He had not before, but
because that event, which from eternity has been prepared in
His unchangeable will, shall then come to pass.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Of the promise of eternal blessedness to the saints, and everlasting
punishment to the wicked.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore, not to mention many other instances besides, as
we now see in Christ the fulfilment of that which God promised
to Abraham when He said, "In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed,"<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> so this also shall be fulfilled which He
promised to the same race, when He said by the prophet,
"They that are in their sepulchres shall rise again;"<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and
also, "There shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and the
former shall not be mentioned, nor come into mind; but they
shall find joy and rejoicing in it: for I will make Jerusalem
a rejoicing, and my people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
and joy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
be no more heard in her."<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> And by another prophet He
uttered the same prediction: "At that time thy people shall
be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
And many of them that sleep in the dust" (or, as some interpret
it, "in the mound") "of the earth shall awake, some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
And in another place by the same prophet: "The saints of
the Most High shall take the kingdom, and shall possess the
kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> And a little
after he says, "His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>
Other prophecies referring to the same subject I have advanced
in the twentieth book, and others still which I have
not advanced are found written in the same Scriptures; and
these predictions shall be fulfilled, as those also have been
which unbelieving men supposed would be frustrate. For it
is the same God who promised both, and predicted that both
would come to pass,&mdash;the God whom the pagan deities tremble
before, as even Porphyry, the noblest of pagan philosophers,
testifies.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Against the wise men of the world, who fancy that the earthly bodies of men
cannot be transferred to a heavenly habitation.</i></p>

<p>But men who use their learning and intellectual ability to
resist the force of that great authority which, in fulfilment of
what was so long before predicted, has converted all races of
men to faith and hope in its promises, seem to themselves to
argue acutely against the resurrection of the body while they
cite what Cicero mentions in the third book <i>De Republica</i>.
For when he was asserting the apotheosis of Hercules and
Romulus, he says: "Whose bodies were not taken up into
heaven; for nature would not permit a body of earth to exist
anywhere except upon earth." This, forsooth, is the profound
reasoning of the wise men, whose thoughts God knows that
they are vain. For if we were only souls, that is, spirits
without any body, and if we dwelt in heaven and had no
knowledge of earthly animals, and were told that we should
be bound to earthly bodies by some wonderful bond of union,
and should animate them, should we not much more vigorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
refuse to believe this, and maintain that nature would
not permit an incorporeal substance to be held by a corporeal
bond? And yet the earth is full of living spirits, to which
terrestrial bodies are bound, and with which they are in a
wonderful way implicated. If, then, the same God who has
created such beings wills this also, what is to hinder the
earthly body from being raised to a heavenly body, since a
spirit, which is more excellent than all bodies, and consequently
than even a heavenly body, has been tied to an earthly
body? If so small an earthly particle has been able to hold
in union with itself something better than a heavenly body,
so as to receive sensation and life, will heaven disdain to
receive, or at least to retain, this sentient and living particle,
which derives its life and sensation from a substance more
excellent than any heavenly body? If this does not happen
now, it is because the time is not yet come which has been
determined by Him who has already done a much more marvellous
thing than that which these men refuse to believe.
For why do we not more intensely wonder that incorporeal
souls, which are of higher rank than heavenly bodies, are
bound to earthly bodies, rather than that bodies, although
earthly, are exalted to an abode which, though heavenly, is yet
corporeal, except because we have been accustomed to see
this, and indeed are this, while we are not as yet that other
marvel, nor have as yet ever seen it? Certainly, if we consult
sober reason, the more wonderful of the two divine works
is found to be to attach somehow corporeal things to incorporeal,
and not to connect earthly things with heavenly,
which, though diverse, are yet both of them corporeal.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the resurrection of the flesh, which some refuse to believe, though the
world at large believes it.</i></p>

<p>But granting that this was once incredible, behold, now, the
world has come to the belief that the earthly body of Christ
was received up into heaven. Already both the learned and
unlearned have believed in the resurrection of the flesh and
its ascension to the heavenly places, while only a very few
either of the educated or uneducated are still staggered by it.
If this is a credible thing which is believed, then let those
who do not believe see how stolid they are; and if it is incredible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
then this also is an incredible thing, that what is
incredible should have received such credit. Here then we
have two incredibles,&mdash;to wit, the resurrection of our body to
eternity, and that the world should believe so incredible a
thing; and both these incredibles the same God predicted
should come to pass before either had as yet occurred. We
see that already one of the two has come to pass, for the world
has believed what was incredible; why should we despair
that the remaining one shall also come to pass, and that this
which the world believed, though it was incredible, shall itself
occur? For already that which was equally incredible has
come to pass, in the world's believing an incredible thing.
Both were incredible: the one we see accomplished, the other
we believe shall be; for both were predicted in those same
Scriptures by means of which the world believed. And the
very manner in which the world's faith was won is found to
be even more incredible, if we consider it. Men uninstructed
in any branch of a liberal education, without any of the refinement
of heathen learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed
with dialectic, not adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen,
and very few in number,&mdash;these were the men whom Christ
sent with the nets of faith to the sea of this world, and thus
took out of every race so many fishes, and even the philosophers
themselves, wonderful as they are rare. Let us add, if
you please, or because you ought to be pleased, this third
incredible thing to the two former. And now we have three
incredibles, all of which have yet come to pass. It is incredible
that Jesus Christ should have risen in the flesh and
ascended with flesh into heaven; it is incredible that the
world should have believed so incredible a thing; it is incredible
that a very few men, of mean birth and the lowest
rank, and no education, should have been able so effectually
to persuade the world, and even its learned men, of so incredible
a thing. Of these three incredibles, the parties with
whom we are debating refuse to believe the first; they cannot
refuse to see the second, which they are unable to account for
if they do not believe the third. It is indubitable that the
resurrection of Christ, and His ascension into heaven with the
flesh in which He rose, is already preached and believed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
the whole world. If it is not credible, how is it that it has
already received credence in the whole world? If a number
of noble, exalted, and learned men had said that they had
witnessed it, and had been at pains to publish what they had
witnessed, it were not wonderful that the world should have
believed it, but it were very stubborn to refuse credence; but
if, as is true, the world has believed a few obscure, inconsiderable,
uneducated persons, who state and write that they
witnessed it, is it not unreasonable that a handful of wrong-headed
men should oppose themselves to the creed of the
whole world, and refuse their belief? And if the world has
put faith in a small number of men, of mean birth and the
lowest rank, and no education, it is because the divinity of the
thing itself appeared all the more manifestly in such contemptible
witnesses. The eloquence, indeed, which lent persuasion
to their message, consisted of wonderful works, not
words. For they who had not seen Christ risen in the flesh,
nor ascending into heaven with His risen body, believed those
who related how they had seen these things, and who testified
not only with words but wonderful signs. For men whom they
knew to be acquainted with only one, or at most two languages,
they marvelled to hear speaking in the tongues of all nations.
They saw a man, lame from his mother's womb, after forty
years stand up sound at their word in the name of Christ;
that handkerchiefs taken from their bodies had virtue to heal
the sick; that countless persons, sick of various diseases, were
laid in a row in the road where they were to pass, that their
shadow might fall on them as they walked, and that they
forthwith received health; that many other stupendous
miracles were wrought by them in the name of Christ; and,
finally, that they even raised the dead. If it be admitted
that these things occurred as they are related, then we have
a multitude of incredible things to add to those three incredibles.
That the one incredibility of the resurrection and
ascension of Jesus Christ may be believed, we accumulate the
testimonies of countless incredible miracles, but even so we
do not bend the frightful obstinacy of these sceptics. But if
they do not believe that these miracles were wrought by
Christ's apostles to gain credence to their preaching of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
resurrection and ascension, this one grand miracle suffices for
us, that the whole world has believed without any miracles.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That Rome made its founder Romulus a god because it loved him; but the
Church loved Christ because it believed Him to be God.</i></p>

<p>Let us here recite the passage in which Tully expresses his
astonishment that the apotheosis of Romulus should have been
credited. I shall insert his words as they stand: "It is most
worthy of remark in Romulus, that other men who are said to
have become gods lived in less educated ages, when there was
a greater propensity to the fabulous, and when the uninstructed
were easily persuaded to believe anything. But the age of
Romulus was barely six hundred years ago, and already literature
and science had dispelled the errors that attach to an
uncultured age." And a little after he says of the same
Romulus words to this effect: "From this we may perceive
that Homer had flourished long before Romulus, and that there
was now so much learning in individuals, and so generally
diffused an enlightenment, that scarcely any room was left for
fable. For antiquity admitted fables, and sometimes even
very clumsy ones; but this age [of Romulus] was sufficiently
enlightened to reject whatever had not the air of truth." Thus
one of the most learned men, and certainly the most eloquent,
M. Tullius Cicero, says that it is surprising that the divinity
of Romulus was believed in, because the times were already so
enlightened that they would not accept a fabulous fiction. But
who believed that Romulus was a god except Rome, which was
itself small and in its infancy? Then afterwards it was necessary
that succeeding generations should preserve the tradition
of their ancestors; that, drinking in this superstition with their
mother's milk, the state might grow and come to such power
that it might dictate this belief, as from a point of vantage,
to all the nations over whom its sway extended. And these
nations, though they might not believe that Romulus was a
god, at least said so, that they might not give offence to their
sovereign state by refusing to give its founder that title which
was given him by Rome, which had adopted this belief, not by
a love of error, but an error of love. But though Christ is the
founder of the heavenly and eternal city, yet it did not believe
Him to be God because it was founded by Him, but rather it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
is founded by Him, in virtue of its belief. Rome, after it
had been built and dedicated, worshipped its founder in a
temple as a god; but this Jerusalem laid Christ, its God,
as its foundation, that the building and dedication might
proceed. The former city loved its founder, and therefore
believed him to be a god; the latter believed Christ to be God,
and therefore loved Him. There was an antecedent cause for
the love of the former city, and for its believing that even a
false dignity attached to the object of its love; so there was
an antecedent cause for the belief of the latter, and for its
loving the true dignity which a proper faith, not a rash surmise,
ascribed to its object. For, not to mention the multitude of
very striking miracles which proved that Christ is God, there
were also divine prophecies heralding Him, prophecies most
worthy of belief, which being already accomplished, we have
not, like the fathers, to wait for their verification. Of Romulus,
on the other hand, and of his building Rome and reigning in
it, we read or hear the narrative of what did take place, not
prediction which beforehand said that such things should be.
And so far as his reception among the gods is concerned, history
only records that this was believed, and does not state it
as a fact; for no miraculous signs testified to the truth of
this. For as to that wolf which is said to have nursed the
twin-brothers, and which is considered a great marvel, how
does this prove him to have been divine? For even supposing
that this nurse was a real wolf and not a mere courtezan,
yet she nursed both brothers, and Remus is not reckoned a
god. Besides, what was there to hinder any one from asserting
that Romulus or Hercules, or any such man, was a god?
Or who would rather choose to die than profess belief in his
divinity? And did a single nation worship Romulus among
its gods, unless it were forced through fear of the Roman
name? But who can number the multitudes who have chosen
death in the most cruel shapes rather than deny the divinity
of Christ? And thus the dread of some slight indignation,
which it was supposed, perhaps groundlessly, might exist in the
minds of the Romans, constrained some states who were subject
to Rome to worship Romulus as a god; whereas the dread,
not of a slight mental shock, but of severe and various punishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
and of death itself, the most formidable of all, could not
prevent an immense multitude of martyrs throughout the world
from not merely worshipping but also confessing Christ as God.
The city of Christ, which, although as yet a stranger upon
earth, had countless hosts of citizens, did not make war upon
its godless persecutors for the sake of temporal security, but
preferred to win eternal salvation by abstaining from war.
They were bound, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, burned, torn
in pieces, massacred, and yet they multiplied. It was not
given to them to fight for their eternal salvation except by
despising their temporal salvation for their Saviour's sake.</p>

<p>I am aware that Cicero, in the third book of his <i>De Republica</i>,
if I mistake not, argues that a first-rate power will not
engage in war except either for honour or for safety. What
he has to say about the question of safety, and what he means
by safety, he explains in another place, saying, "Private persons
frequently evade, by a speedy death, destitution, exile,
bonds, the scourge, and the other pains which even the most
insensible feel. But to states, death, which seems to emancipate
individuals from all punishments, is itself a punishment;
for a state should be so constituted as to be eternal. And
thus death is not natural to a republic as to a man, to whom
death is not only necessary, but often even desirable. But
when a state is destroyed, obliterated, annihilated, it is as if
(to compare great things with small) this whole world perished
and collapsed." Cicero said this because he, with the Platonists,
believed that the world would not perish. It is therefore
agreed that, according to Cicero, a state should engage in
war for the safety which preserves the state permanently in
existence, though its citizens change; as the foliage of an olive
or laurel, or any tree of this kind, is perennial, the old leaves
being replaced by fresh ones. For death, as he says, is no
punishment to individuals, but rather delivers them from all
other punishments, but it is a punishment to the state. And
therefore it is reasonably asked whether the Saguntines did
right when they chose that their whole state should perish
rather than that they should break faith with the Roman
republic; for this deed of theirs is applauded by the citizens
of the earthly republic. But I do not see how they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
follow the advice of Cicero, who tells us that no war is to be
undertaken save for safety or for honour; neither does he say
which of these two is to be preferred, if a case should occur
in which the one could not be preserved without the loss of
the other. For manifestly, if the Saguntines chose safety, they
must break faith; if they kept faith, they must reject safety;
as also it fell out. But the safety of the city of God is such
that it can be retained, or rather acquired, by faith and with
faith; but if faith be abandoned, no one can attain it. It is
this thought of a most stedfast and patient spirit that has
made so many noble martyrs, while Romulus has not had, and
could not have, so much as one to die for his divinity.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That the world's belief in Christ is the result of divine power, not of human
persuasion.</i></p>

<p>But it is thoroughly ridiculous to make mention of the false
divinity of Romulus as any way comparable to that of Christ.
Nevertheless, if Romulus lived about six hundred years before
Cicero, in an age which already was so enlightened that it
rejected all impossibilities, how much more, in an age which
certainly was more enlightened, being six hundred years later,
the age of Cicero himself, and of the emperors Augustus and
Tiberius, would the human mind have refused to listen to or
believe in the resurrection of Christ's body and its ascension
into heaven, and have scouted it as an impossibility, had not
the divinity of the truth itself, or the truth of the divinity, and
corroborating miraculous signs, proved that it could happen
and had happened? Through virtue of these testimonies, and
notwithstanding the opposition and terror of so many cruel
persecutions, the resurrection and immortality of the flesh,
first in Christ, and subsequently in all in the new world, was
believed, was intrepidly proclaimed, and was sown over the
whole world, to be fertilized richly with the blood of the
martyrs. For the predictions of the prophets that had preceded
the events were read, they were corroborated by powerful
signs, and the truth was seen to be not contradictory to
reason, but only different from customary ideas, so that at
length the world embraced the faith it had furiously persecuted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of miracles which were wrought that the world might believe in Christ,
and which have not ceased since the world believed.</i></p>

<p>Why, they say, are those miracles, which you affirm were
wrought formerly, wrought no longer? I might, indeed, reply
that miracles were necessary before the world believed, in order
that it might believe. And whoever now-a-days demands to
see prodigies that he may believe, is himself a great prodigy,
because he does not believe, though the whole world does.
But they make these objections for the sole purpose of insinuating
that even those former miracles were never wrought.
How, then, is it that everywhere Christ is celebrated with
such firm belief in His resurrection and ascension? How is it
that in enlightened times, in which every impossibility is rejected,
the world has, without any miracles, believed things
marvellously incredible? Or will they say that these things
were credible, and therefore were credited? Why then do
they themselves not believe? Our argument, therefore, is a
summary one&mdash;either incredible things which were not witnessed
have caused the world to believe other incredible things
which both occurred and were witnessed, or this matter was
so credible that it needed no miracles in proof of it, and therefore
convicts these unbelievers of unpardonable scepticism.
This I might say for the sake of refuting these most frivolous
objectors. But we cannot deny that many miracles were
wrought to confirm that one grand and health-giving miracle
of Christ's ascension to heaven with the flesh in which He
rose. For these most trustworthy books of ours contain in
one narrative both the miracles that were wrought and the
creed which they were wrought to confirm. The miracles
were published that they might produce faith, and the faith
which they produced brought them into greater prominence.
For they are read in congregations that they may be believed,
and yet they would not be so read unless they were believed.
For even now miracles are wrought in the name of Christ,
whether by His sacraments or by the prayers or relics of His
saints; but they are not so brilliant and conspicuous as to
cause them to be published with such glory as accompanied
the former miracles. For the canon of the sacred writings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
which behoved to be closed,<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> causes those to be everywhere
recited, and to sink into the memory of all the congregations;
but these modern miracles are scarcely known even to the
whole population in the midst of which they are wrought, and
at the best are confined to one spot. For frequently they are
known only to a very few persons, while all the rest are ignorant
of them, especially if the state is a large one; and when
they are reported to other persons in other localities, there is
no sufficient authority to give them prompt and unwavering
credence, although they are reported to the faithful by the
faithful.</p>

<p>The miracle which was wrought at Milan when I was there,
and by which a blind man was restored to sight, could come
to the knowledge of many; for not only is the city a large one,
but also the emperor was there at the time, and the occurrence
was witnessed by an immense concourse of people that had
gathered to the bodies of the martyrs Protasius and Gervasius,
which had long lain concealed and unknown, but were now
made known to the bishop Ambrose in a dream, and discovered
by him. By virtue of these remains the darkness of that blind
man was scattered, and he saw the light of day.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

<p>But who but a very small number are aware of the cure
which was wrought upon Innocentius, ex-advocate of the deputy
prefecture, a cure wrought at Carthage, in my presence, and
under my own eyes? For when I and my brother Alypius,<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> who
were not yet clergymen,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> though already servants of God, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
from abroad, this man received us, and made us live with
him, for he and all his household were devotedly pious. He
was being treated by medical men for fistulæ, of which he
had a large number intricately seated in the rectum. He had
already undergone an operation, and the surgeons were using
every means at their command for his relief. In that operation
he had suffered long-continued and acute pain; yet, among
the many folds of the gut, one had escaped the operators so
entirely, that, though they ought to have laid it open with the
knife, they never touched it. And thus, though all those that
had been opened were cured, this one remained as it was, and
frustrated all their labour. The patient, having his suspicions
awakened by the delay thus occasioned, and fearing greatly a
second operation, which another medical man&mdash;one of his own
domestics&mdash;had told him he must undergo, though this man
had not even been allowed to witness the first operation, and
had been banished from the house, and with difficulty allowed
to come back to his enraged master's presence,&mdash;the patient, I
say, broke out to the surgeons, saying, "Are you going to cut
me again? Are you, after all, to fulfil the prediction of that
man whom you would not allow even to be present?" The
surgeons laughed at the unskilful doctor, and soothed their
patient's fears with fair words and promises. So several days
passed, and yet nothing they tried did him good. Still they
persisted in promising that they would cure that fistula by
drugs, without the knife. They called in also another old
practitioner of great repute in that department, Ammonius (for
he was still alive at that time); and he, after examining the
part, promised the same result as themselves from their care
and skill. On this great authority, the patient became confident,
and, as if already well, vented his good spirits in facetious
remarks at the expense of his domestic physician, who had predicted
a second operation. To make a long story short, after
a number of days had thus uselessly elapsed, the surgeons,
wearied and confused, had at last to confess that he could only
be cured by the knife. Agitated with excessive fear, he was
terrified, and grew pale with dread; and when he collected
himself and was able to speak, he ordered them to go away
and never to return. Worn out with weeping, and driven by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
necessity, it occurred to him to call in an Alexandrian, who
was at that time esteemed a wonderfully skilful operator, that
he might perform the operation his rage would not suffer them
to do. But when he had come, and examined with a professional
eye the traces of their careful work, he acted the
part of a good man, and persuaded his patient to allow those
same hands the satisfaction of finishing his cure which had
begun it with a skill that excited his admiration, adding that
there was no doubt his only hope of a cure was by an operation,
but that it was thoroughly inconsistent with his nature
to win the credit of the cure by doing the little that remained
to be done, and rob of their reward men whose consummate
skill, care, and diligence he could not but admire when he saw
the traces of their work. They were therefore again received
to favour; and it was agreed that, in the presence of the
Alexandrian, they should operate on the fistula, which, by the
consent of all, could now only be cured by the knife. The
operation was deferred till the following day. But when they
had left, there arose in the house such a wailing, in sympathy
with the excessive despondency of the master, that it seemed
to us like the mourning at a funeral, and we could scarcely
repress it. Holy men were in the habit of visiting him daily;
Saturninus of blessed memory, at that time bishop of Uzali,
and the presbyter Gelosus, and the deacons of the church of
Carthage; and among these was the bishop Aurelius, who
alone of them all survives,&mdash;a man to be named by us with due
reverence,&mdash;and with him I have often spoken of this affair,
as we conversed together about the wonderful works of God,
and I have found that he distinctly remembers what I am
now relating. When these persons visited him that evening
according to their custom, he besought them, with pitiable
tears, that they would do him the honour of being present next
day at what he judged his funeral rather than his suffering.
For such was the terror his former pains had produced, that he
made no doubt he would die in the hands of the surgeons.
They comforted him, and exhorted him to put his trust in
God, and nerve his will like a man. Then we went to prayer;
but while we, in the usual way, were kneeling and bending
to the ground, he cast himself down, as if some one were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
hurling him violently to the earth, and began to pray; but in
what a manner, with what earnestness and emotion, with what
a flood of tears, with what groans and sobs, that shook his
whole body, and almost prevented him speaking, who can
describe! Whether the others prayed, and had not their
attention wholly diverted by this conduct, I do not know. For
myself, I could not pray at all. This only I briefly said in my
heart: "O Lord, what prayers of Thy people dost Thou hear
if Thou hearest not these?" For it seemed to me that nothing
could be added to this prayer, unless he expired in praying.
We rose from our knees, and, receiving the blessing of the
bishop, departed, the patient beseeching his visitors to be present
next morning, they exhorting him to keep up his heart.
The dreaded day dawned. The servants of God were present,
as they had promised to be; the surgeons arrived; all
that the circumstances required was ready; the frightful
instruments are produced; all look on in wonder and suspense.
While those who have most influence with the patient are
cheering his fainting spirit, his limbs are arranged on the
couch so as to suit the hand of the operator; the knots of the
bandages are untied; the part is bared; the surgeon examines
it, and, with knife in hand, eagerly looks for the sinus that is
to be cut. He searches for it with his eyes; he feels for it
with his finger; he applies every kind of scrutiny: he finds a
perfectly firm cicatrix! No words of mine can describe the
joy, and praise, and thanksgiving to the merciful and almighty
God which was poured from the lips of all, with tears of gladness.
Let the scene be imagined rather than described!</p>

<p>In the same city of Carthage lived Innocentia, a very
devout woman of the highest rank in the state. She had
cancer in one of her breasts, a disease which, as physicians
say, is incurable. Ordinarily, therefore, they either amputate,
and so separate from the body the member on which the disease
has seized, or, that the patient's life may be prolonged a little,
though death is inevitable even if somewhat delayed, they
abandon all remedies, following, as they say, the advice of
Hippocrates. This the lady we speak of had been advised to
by a skilful physician, who was intimate with her family; and
she betook herself to God alone by prayer. On the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
of Easter, she was instructed in a dream to wait for the first
woman that came out from the baptistery<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> after being baptized,
and to ask her to make the sign of Christ upon her sore. She
did so, and was immediately cured. The physician who had
advised her to apply no remedy if she wished to live a little
longer, when he had examined her after this, and found that
she who, on his former examination, was afflicted with that
disease was now perfectly cured, eagerly asked her what
remedy she had used, anxious, as we may well believe, to discover
the drug which should defeat the decision of Hippocrates.
But when she told him what had happened, he is said to have
replied, with religious politeness, though with a contemptuous
tone, and an expression which made her fear he would utter
some blasphemy against Christ, "I thought you would make
some great discovery to me." She, shuddering at his indifference,
quickly replied, "What great thing was it for Christ to
heal a cancer, who raised one who had been four days dead?"
When, therefore, I had heard this, I was extremely indignant
that so great a miracle, wrought in that well-known city, and
on a person who was certainly not obscure, should not be
divulged, and I considered that she should be spoken to, if
not reprimanded on this score. And when she replied to me
that she had not kept silence on the subject, I asked the
women with whom she was best acquainted whether they had
ever heard of this before. They told me they knew nothing
of it. "See," I said, "what your not keeping silence amounts
to, since not even those who are so familiar with you know of it."
And as I had only briefly heard the story, I made her tell
how the whole thing happened, from beginning to end, while
the other women listened in great astonishment, and glorified
God.</p>

<p>A gouty doctor of the same city, when he had given in his
name for baptism, and had been prohibited the day before
his baptism from being baptized that year, by black woolly-haired
boys who appeared to him in his dreams, and whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
he understood to be devils, and when, though they trod on
his feet, and inflicted the acutest pain he had ever yet experienced,
he refused to obey them, but overcame them, and
would not defer being washed in the laver of regeneration,
was relieved in the very act of baptism, not only of the extraordinary
pain he was tortured with, but also of the disease
itself, so that, though he lived a long time afterwards, he
never suffered from gout; and yet who knows of this miracle?
We, however, do know it, and so, too, do the small number of
brethren who were in the neighbourhood, and to whose ears
it might come.</p>

<p>An old comedian of Curubis<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> was cured at baptism not
only of paralysis, but also of hernia, and, being delivered from
both afflictions, came up out of the font of regeneration as
if he had had nothing wrong with his body. Who outside of
Curubis knows of this, or who but a very few who might
hear it elsewhere? But we, when we heard of it, made
the man come to Carthage, by order of the holy bishop
Aurelius, although we had already ascertained the fact on the
information of persons whose word we could not doubt.</p>

<p>Hesperius, of a tribunitian family, and a neighbour of our
own,<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> has a farm called Zubedi in the Fussalian district;<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
and, finding that his family, his cattle, and his servants were
suffering from the malice of evil spirits, he asked our presbyters,
during my absence, that one of them would go with
him and banish the spirits by his prayers. One went, offered
there the sacrifice of the body of Christ, praying with all
his might that that vexation might cease. It did cease forthwith,
through God's mercy. Now he had received from a
friend of his own some holy earth brought from Jerusalem,
where Christ, having been buried, rose again the third day.
This earth he had hung up in his bedroom to preserve himself
from harm. But when his house was purged of that
demoniacal invasion, he began to consider what should be
done with the earth; for his reverence for it made him unwilling
to have it any longer in his bedroom. It so happened
that I and Maximinus bishop of Synita, and then my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
colleague, were in the neighbourhood. Hesperius asked us
to visit him, and we did so. When he had related all the
circumstances, he begged that the earth might be buried
somewhere, and that the spot should be made a place of
prayer where Christians might assemble for the worship of
God. We made no objection: it was done as he desired.
There was in that neighbourhood a young countryman who
was paralytic, who, when he heard of this, begged his parents
to take him without delay to that holy place. When he had
been brought there, he prayed, and forthwith went away on
his own feet perfectly cured.</p>

<p>There is a country-seat called Victoriana, less than thirty
miles from Hippo-regius. At it there is a monument to the
Milanese martyrs, Protasius and Gervasius. Thither a young
man was carried, who, when he was watering his horse one
summer day at noon in a pool of a river, had been taken
possession of by a devil. As he lay at the monument, near
death, or even quite like a dead person, the lady of the manor,
with her maids and religious attendants, entered the place
for evening prayer and praise, as her custom was, and they
began to sing hymns. At this sound the young man, as if
electrified, was thoroughly aroused, and with frightful screaming
seized the altar, and held it as if he did not dare or were
not able to let it go, and as if he were fixed or tied to it;
and the devil in him, with loud lamentation, besought that
he might be spared, and confessed where and when and how
he took possession of the youth. At last, declaring that he
would go out of him, he named one by one the parts of his
body which he threatened to mutilate as he went out; and
with these words he departed from the man. But his eye,
falling out on his cheek, hung by a slender vein as by a root,
and the whole of the pupil which had been black became
white. When this was witnessed by those present (others
too had now gathered to his cries, and had all joined in
prayer for him), although they were delighted that he had
recovered his sanity of mind, yet, on the other hand, they
were grieved about his eye, and said he should seek medical
advice. But his sister's husband, who had brought him
there, said, "God, who has banished the devil, is able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
restore his eye at the prayers of His saints." Therewith he
replaced the eye that was fallen out and hanging, and bound
it in its place with his handkerchief as well as he could, and
advised him not to loose the bandage for seven days. When
he did so, he found it quite healthy. Others also were cured
there, but of them it were tedious to speak.</p>

<p>I know that a young woman of Hippo was immediately
dispossessed of a devil, on anointing herself with oil mixed
with the tears of the presbyter who had been praying for
her. I know also that a bishop once prayed for a demoniac
young man whom he never saw, and that he was cured on
the spot.</p>

<p>There was a fellow-townsman of ours at Hippo, Florentius,
an old man, religious and poor, who supported himself as a
tailor. Having lost his coat, and not having means to buy
another, he prayed to the Twenty Martyrs,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> who have a very
celebrated memorial shrine in our town, begging in a distinct
voice that he might be clothed. Some scoffing young men,
who happened to be present, heard him, and followed him
with their sarcasm as he went away, as if he had asked the
martyrs for fifty pence to buy a coat. But he, walking on in
silence, saw on the shore a great fish, gasping as if just cast
up, and having secured it with the good-natured assistance of
the youths, he sold it for curing to a cook of the name of
Catosus, a good Christian man, telling him how he had come
by it, and receiving for it three hundred pence, which he laid
out in wool, that his wife might exercise her skill upon, and
make into a coat for him. But, on cutting up the fish, the
cook found a gold ring in its belly; and forthwith, moved
with compassion, and influenced, too, by religious fear, gave it
up to the man, saying, "See how the Twenty Martyrs have
clothed you."</p>

<p>When the bishop Projectus was bringing the relics of the
most glorious martyr Stephen to the waters of Tibilis, a great
concourse of people came to meet him at the shrine. There
a blind woman entreated that she might be led to the bishop
who was carrying the relics. He gave her the flowers he
was carrying. She took them, applied them to her eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
forthwith saw. Those who were present were astounded,
while she, with every expression of joy, preceded them, pursuing
her way without further need of a guide.</p>

<p>Lucillus bishop of Sinita, in the neighbourhood of the
colonial town of Hippo, was carrying in procession some
relics of the same martyr, which had been deposited in the
castle of Sinita. A fistula under which he had long laboured,
and which his private physician was watching an opportunity
to cut, was suddenly cured by the mere carrying of that
sacred fardel,<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>&mdash;at least, afterwards there was no trace of it
in his body.</p>

<p>Eucharius, a Spanish priest, residing at Calama, was for a
long time a sufferer from stone. By the relics of the same
martyr, which the bishop Possidius brought him, he was
cured. Afterwards the same priest, sinking under another
disease, was lying dead, and already they were binding his
hands. By the succour of the same martyr he was raised to
life, the priest's cloak having been brought from the oratory
and laid upon the corpse.</p>

<p>There was there an old nobleman named Martial, who had
a great aversion to the Christian religion, but whose daughter
was a Christian, while her husband had been baptized that
same year. When he was ill, they besought him with tears
and prayers to become a Christian, but he positively refused,
and dismissed them from his presence in a storm of indignation.
It occurred to the son-in-law to go to the oratory of
St. Stephen, and there pray for him with all earnestness that
God might give him a right mind, so that he should not
delay believing in Christ. This he did with great groaning
and tears, and the burning fervour of sincere piety; then, as
he left the place, he took some of the flowers that were lying
there, and, as it was already night, laid them by his father's
head, who so slept. And lo! before dawn, he cries out for
some one to run for the bishop; but he happened at that
time to be with me at Hippo. So when he had heard that
he was from home, he asked the presbyters to come. They
came. To the joy and amazement of all, he declared that he
believed, and he was baptized. As long as he remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
life, these words were ever on his lips: "Christ, receive my
spirit," though he was not aware that these were the last
words of the most blessed Stephen when he was stoned by
the Jews. They were his last words also, for not long after
he himself also gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>There, too, by the same martyr, two men, one a citizen, the
other a stranger, were cured of gout; but while the citizen
was absolutely cured, the stranger was only informed what he
should apply when the pain returned; and when he followed
this advice, the pain was at once relieved.</p>

<p>Audurus is the name of an estate, where there is a church
that contains a memorial shrine of the martyr Stephen. It
happened that, as a little boy was playing in the court, the
oxen drawing a waggon went out of the track and crushed
him with the wheel, so that immediately he seemed at his
last gasp. His mother snatched him up, and laid him at the
shrine, and not only did he revive, but also appeared uninjured.</p>

<p>A religious female, who lived at Caspalium, a neighbouring
estate, when she was so ill as to be despaired of, had her dress
brought to this shrine, but before it was brought back she was
gone. However, her parents wrapped her corpse in the dress,
and, her breath returning, she became quite well.</p>

<p>At Hippo a Syrian called Bassus was praying at the relics
of the same martyr for his daughter, who was dangerously ill.
He too had brought her dress with him to the shrine. But
as he prayed, behold, his servants ran from the house to tell
him she was dead. His friends, however, intercepted them,
and forbade them to tell him, lest he should bewail her in
public. And when he had returned to his house, which was
already ringing with the lamentations of his family, and had
thrown on his daughter's body the dress he was carrying,
she was restored to life.</p>

<p>There, too, the son of a man, Irenæus, one of our tax-gatherers,
took ill and died. And while his body was lying
lifeless, and the last rites were being prepared, amidst the
weeping and mourning of all, one of the friends who were
consoling the father suggested that the body should be
anointed with the oil of the same martyr. It was done, and
he revived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p>Likewise Eleusinus, a man of tribunitian rank among us,
laid his infant son, who had died, on the shrine of the martyr,
which is in the suburb where he lived, and, after prayer,
which he poured out there with many tears, he took up his
child alive.</p>

<p>What am I to do? I am so pressed by the promise of
finishing this work, that I cannot record all the miracles I
know; and doubtless several of our adherents, when they
read what I have narrated, will regret that I have omitted
so many which they, as well as I, certainly know. Even now
I beg these persons to excuse me, and to consider how long it
would take me to relate all those miracles, which the necessity
of finishing the work I have undertaken forces me to omit.
For were I to be silent of all others, and to record exclusively
the miracles of healing which were wrought in the district of
Calama and of Hippo by means of this martyr&mdash;I mean the
most glorious Stephen&mdash;they would fill many volumes; and
yet all even of these could not be collected, but only those of
which narratives have been written for public recital. For
when I saw, in our own times, frequent signs of the presence
of divine powers similar to those which had been given of
old, I desired that narratives might be written, judging that
the multitude should not remain ignorant of these things. It
is not yet two years since these relics were first brought to
Hippo-regius, and though many of the miracles which have
been wrought by it have not, as I have the most certain
means of knowing, been recorded, those which have been
published amount to almost seventy at the hour at which I
write. But at Calama, where these relics have been for a
longer time, and where more of the miracles were narrated
for public information, there are incomparably more.</p>

<p>At Uzali, too, a colony near Utica, many signal miracles
were, to my knowledge, wrought by the same martyr, whose
relics had found a place there by direction of the bishop
Evodius, long before we had them at Hippo. But there the
custom of publishing narratives does not obtain, or, I should
say, did not obtain, for possibly it may now have been begun.
For, when I was there recently, a woman of rank, Petronia,
had been miraculously cured of a serious illness of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
standing, in which all medical appliances had failed, and, with
the consent of the above-named bishop of the place, I exhorted
her to publish an account of it that might be read to the
people. She most promptly obeyed, and inserted in her
narrative a circumstance which I cannot omit to mention,
though I am compelled to hasten on to the subjects which
this work requires me to treat. She said that she had been
persuaded by a Jew to wear next her skin, under all her
clothes, a hair girdle, and on this girdle a ring, which, instead
of a gem, had a stone which had been found in the kidneys of
an ox. Girt with this charm, she was making her way to
the threshold of the holy martyr. But, after leaving Carthage,
and when she had been lodging in her own demesne on the
river Bagrada, and was now rising to continue her journey,
she saw her ring lying before her feet. In great surprise
she examined the hair girdle, and when she found it bound, as
it had been, quite firmly with knots, she conjectured that the
ring had been worn through and dropped off; but when she
found that the ring was itself also perfectly whole, she presumed
that by this great miracle she had received somehow
a pledge of her cure, whereupon she untied the girdle, and
cast it into the river, and the ring along with it. This is not
credited by those who do not believe either that the Lord
Jesus Christ came forth from His mother's womb without
destroying her virginity, and entered among His disciples
when the doors were shut; but let them make strict inquiry
into this miracle, and if they find it true, let them believe
those others. The lady is of distinction, nobly born, married
to a nobleman. She resides at Carthage. The city is distinguished,
the person is distinguished, so that they who make
inquiries cannot fail to find satisfaction. Certainly the martyr
himself, by whose prayers she was healed, believed on the Son
of her who remained a virgin; on Him who came in among
the disciples when the doors were shut; in fine,&mdash;and to this
tends all that we have been retailing,&mdash;on Him who ascended
into heaven with the flesh in which He had risen; and it is
because he laid down his life for this faith that such miracles
were done by his means.</p>

<p>Even now, therefore, many miracles are wrought, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
God who wrought those we read of still performing them, by
whom He will and as He will; but they are not as well
known, nor are they beaten into the memory, like gravel, by
frequent reading, so that they cannot fall out of mind. For
even where, as is now done among ourselves, care is taken
that the pamphlets of those who receive benefit be read
publicly, yet those who are present hear the narrative but
once, and many are absent; and so it comes to pass that even
those who are present forget in a few days what they heard,
and scarcely one of them can be found who will tell what he
heard to one who he knows was not present.</p>

<p>One miracle was wrought among ourselves, which, though
no greater than those I have mentioned, was yet so signal
and conspicuous, that I suppose there is no inhabitant of
Hippo who did not either see or hear of it, none who could
possibly forget it. There were seven brothers and three sisters
of a noble family of the Cappadocian Cæsarea, who were cursed
by their mother, a new-made widow, on account of some
wrong they had done her, and which she bitterly resented, and
who were visited with so severe a punishment from Heaven,
that all of them were seized with a hideous shaking in all
their limbs. Unable, while presenting this loathsome appearance,
to endure the eyes of their fellow-citizens, they wandered
over almost the whole Roman world, each following his own
direction. Two of them came to Hippo, a brother and a sister,
Paulus and Palladia, already known in many other places by
the fame of their wretched lot. Now it was about fifteen
days before Easter when they came, and they came daily to
church, and specially to the relics of the most glorious Stephen,
praying that God might now be appeased, and restore their
former health. There, and wherever they went, they attracted
the attention of every one. Some who had seen them elsewhere,
and knew the cause of their trembling, told others as
occasion offered. Easter arrived, and on the Lord's day, in
the morning, when there was now a large crowd present, and
the young man was holding the bars of the holy place where
the relics were, and praying, suddenly he fell down, and lay
precisely as if asleep, but not trembling as he was wont to
do even in sleep. All present were astonished. Some were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
alarmed, some were moved with pity; and while some were
for lifting him up, others prevented them, and said they should
rather wait and see what would result. And behold! he rose
up, and trembled no more, for he was healed, and stood quite
well, scanning those who were scanning him. Who then
refrained himself from praising God? The whole church was
filled with the voices of those who were shouting and congratulating
him. Then they came running to me, where I
was sitting ready to come into the church. One after another
they throng in, the last comer telling me as news what the
first had told me already; and while I rejoiced and inwardly
gave God thanks, the young man himself also enters, with a
number of others, falls at my knees, is raised up to receive
my kiss. We go in to the congregation: the church was
full, and ringing with the shouts of joy, "Thanks to God!
Praised be God!" every one joining and shouting on all sides,
"I have healed the people," and then with still louder voice
shouting again. Silence being at last obtained, the customary
lessons of the divine Scriptures were read. And when I came
to my sermon, I made a few remarks suitable to the occasion
and the happy and joyful feeling, not desiring them to listen
to me, but rather to consider the eloquence of God in this
divine work. The man dined with us, and gave us a careful
account of his own, his mother's, and his family's calamity.
Accordingly, on the following day, after delivering my sermon,
I promised that next day I would read his narrative to the
people.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> And when I did so, the third day after Easter Sunday,
I made the brother and sister both stand on the steps of
the raised place from which I used to speak; and while they
stood there their pamphlet was read.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> The whole congregation,
men and women alike, saw the one standing without any
unnatural movement, the other trembling in all her limbs;
so that those who had not before seen the man himself saw
in his sister what the divine compassion had removed from
him. In him they saw matter of congratulation, in her subject
for prayer. Meanwhile, their pamphlet being finished,
I instructed them to withdraw from the gaze of the people;
and I had begun to discuss the whole matter somewhat more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
carefully, when lo! as I was proceeding, other voices are heard
from the tomb of the martyr, shouting new congratulations.
My audience turned round, and began to run to the tomb.
The young woman, when she had come down from the steps
where she had been standing, went to pray at the holy relics,
and no sooner had she touched the bars than she, in the same
way as her brother, collapsed, as if falling asleep, and rose
up cured. While, then, we were asking what had happened,
and what occasioned this noise of joy, they came into the
basilica where we were, leading her from the martyr's tomb
in perfect health. Then, indeed, such a shout of wonder rose
from men and women together, that the exclamations and the
tears seemed like never to come to an end. She was led to
the place where she had a little before stood trembling. They
now rejoiced that she was like her brother, as before they had
mourned that she remained unlike him; and as they had not
yet uttered their prayers in her behalf, they perceived that
their intention of doing so had been speedily heard. They
shouted God's praises without words, but with such a noise
that our ears could scarcely bear it. What was there in the
hearts of these exultant people but the faith of Christ, for
which Stephen had shed his blood?</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>That all the miracles which are done by means of the martyrs in the name of
Christ testify to that faith which the martyrs had in Christ.</i></p>

<p>To what do these miracles witness, but to this faith which
preaches Christ risen in the flesh, and ascended with the same
into heaven? For the martyrs themselves were martyrs, that
is to say, witnesses of this faith, drawing upon themselves by
their testimony the hatred of the world, and conquering the
world not by resisting it, but by dying. For this faith they
died, and can now ask these benefits from the Lord in whose
name they were slain. For this faith their marvellous constancy
was exercised, so that in these miracles great power
was manifested as the result. For if the resurrection of the
flesh to eternal life had not taken place in Christ, and were
not to be accomplished in His people, as predicted by Christ,
or by the prophets who foretold that Christ was to come,
why do the martyrs who were slain for this faith which proclaims
the resurrection possess such power? For whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
God Himself wrought these miracles by that wonderful
manner of working by which, though Himself eternal, He
produces effects in time; or whether He wrought them by
servants, and if so, whether He made use of the spirits of
martyrs as He uses men who are still in the body, or effects
all these marvels by means of angels, over whom He exerts an
invisible, immutable, incorporeal sway, so that what is said to
be done by the martyrs is done not by their operation, but
only by their prayer and request; or whether, finally, some
things are done in one way, others in another, and so that
man cannot at all comprehend them,&mdash;nevertheless these
miracles attest this faith which preaches the resurrection of
the flesh to eternal life.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>10. <i>That the martyrs who obtain many miracles in order that the true God may
be worshipped, are worthy of much greater honour than the demons, who
do some marvels that they themselves may be supposed to be God.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Here perhaps our adversaries will say that their gods also
have done some wonderful things, if now they begin to compare
their gods to our dead men. Or will they also say that
they have gods taken from among dead men, such as Hercules,
Romulus, and many others whom they fancy to have been
received into the number of the gods? But our martyrs are
not our gods; for we know that the martyrs and we have
both but one God, and that the same. Nor yet are the
miracles which they maintain to have been done by means of
their temples at all comparable to those which are done by
the tombs of our martyrs. If they seem similar, their gods
have been defeated by our martyrs as Pharaoh's magi were by
Moses. In reality, the demons wrought these marvels with
the same impure pride with which they aspired to be the
gods of the nations; but the martyrs do these wonders, or
rather God does them while they pray and assist, in order
that an impulse may be given to the faith by which we believe
that they are not our gods, but have, together with ourselves,
one God. In fine, they built temples to these gods of theirs,
and set up altars, and ordained priests, and appointed sacrifices;
but to our martyrs we build, not temples as if they
were gods, but monuments as to dead men whose spirits live
with God. Neither do we erect altars at these monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
that we may sacrifice to the martyrs, but to the one God of
the martyrs and of ourselves; and in this sacrifice they are
named in their own place and rank as men of God who conquered
the world by confessing Him, but they are not invoked
by the sacrificing priest. For it is to God, not to them, he
sacrifices, though he sacrifices at their monument; for he is
God's priest, not theirs. The sacrifice itself, too, is the body of
Christ, which is not offered to them, because they themselves
are this body. Which then can more readily be believed to
work miracles? They who wish themselves to be reckoned
gods by those on whom they work miracles, or those whose
sole object in working any miracle is to induce faith in God,
and in Christ also as God? They who wished to turn even
their crimes into sacred rites, or those who are unwilling
that even their own praises be consecrated, and seek that
everything for which they are justly praised be ascribed to
the glory of Him in whom they are praised? For in the Lord
their souls are praised. Let us therefore believe those who
both speak the truth and work wonders. For by speaking
the truth they suffered, and so won the power of working
wonders. And the leading truth they professed is that Christ
rose from the dead, and first showed in His own flesh the immortality
of the resurrection which He promised should be
ours, either in the beginning of the world to come, or in the
end of this world.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Against the Platonists, who argue from the physical weight of the elements
that an earthly body cannot inhabit heaven.</i></p>

<p>But against this great gift of God, these reasoners, "whose
thoughts the Lord knows that they are vain,"<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> bring arguments
from the weights of the elements; for they have been
taught by their master Plato that the two greatest elements of
the world, and the furthest removed from one another, are
coupled and united by the two intermediate, air and water.
And consequently they say, since the earth is the first of the
elements, beginning from the base of the series, the second
the water above the earth, the third the air above the water,
the fourth the heaven above the air, it follows that a body of
earth cannot live in the heaven; for each element is poised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
by its own weight so as to preserve its own place and rank.
Behold with what arguments human infirmity, possessed with
vanity, contradicts the omnipotence of God! What, then, do
so many earthly bodies do in the air, since the air is the
third element from the earth? Unless perhaps He who has
granted to the earthly bodies of birds that they be carried
through the air by the lightness of feathers and wings, has
not been able to confer upon the bodies of men made immortal
the power to abide in the highest heaven. The earthly
animals, too, which cannot fly, among which are men, ought
on these terms to live under the earth, as fishes, which are
the animals of the water, live under the water. Why, then,
can an animal of earth not live in the second element, that is,
in water, while it can in the third? Why, though it belongs
to the earth, is it forthwith suffocated if it is forced to live in
the second element next above earth, while it lives in the
third, and cannot live out of it? Is there a mistake here in
the order of the elements, or is not the mistake rather in their
reasonings, and not in the nature of things? I will not repeat
what I said in the thirteenth book,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> that many earthly
bodies, though heavy like lead, receive from the workman's
hand a form which enables them to swim in water; and
yet it is denied that the omnipotent Worker can confer on
the human body a property which shall enable it to pass into
heaven and dwell there.</p>

<p>But against what I have formerly said they can find
nothing to say, even though they introduce and make the
most of this order of the elements in which they confide.
For if the order be that the earth is first, the water second,
the air third, the heaven fourth, then the soul is above all.
For Aristotle said that the soul was a fifth body, while Plato
denied that it was a body at all. If it were a fifth body,
then certainly it would be above the rest; and if it is not a
body at all, so much the more does it rise above all. What,
then, does it do in an earthly body? What does this soul,
which is finer than all else, do in such a mass of matter as
this? What does the lightest of substances do in this ponderosity?
this swiftest substance in such sluggishness? Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
not the body be raised to heaven by virtue of so excellent a
nature as this? and if now earthly bodies can retain the
souls below, shall not the souls be one day able to raise the
earthly bodies above?</p>

<p>If we pass now to their miracles which they oppose to
our martyrs as wrought by their gods, shall not even these
be found to make for us, and help out our argument? For
if any of the miracles of their gods are great, certainly
that is a great one which Varro mentions of a vestal virgin,
who, when she was endangered by a false accusation of unchastity,
filled a sieve with water from the Tiber, and carried
it to her judges without any part of it leaking. Who kept
the weight of water in the sieve? Who prevented any drop
from falling from it through so many open holes? They will
answer, Some god or some demon. If a god, is he greater
than the God who made the world? If a demon, is he
mightier than an angel who serves the God by whom the
world was made? If, then, a lesser god, angel, or demon could
so sustain the weight of this liquid element that the water
might seem to have changed its nature, shall not Almighty
God, who Himself created all the elements, be able to eliminate
from the earthly body its heaviness, so that the quickened
body shall dwell in whatever element the quickening spirit
pleases?</p>

<p>Then, again, since they give the air a middle place between
the fire above and the water beneath, how is it that we often
find it between water and water, and between the water and
the earth? For what do they make of those watery clouds,
between which and the seas air is constantly found intervening?
I should like to know by what weight and order of the
elements it comes to pass that very violent and stormy torrents
are suspended in the clouds above the earth before they rush
along upon the earth under the air? In fine, why is it that
throughout the whole globe the air is between the highest
heaven and the earth, if its place is between the sky and the
water, as the place of the water is between the sky and the
earth?</p>

<p>Finally, if the order of the elements is so disposed that,
as Plato thinks, the two extremes, fire and earth, are united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
by the two means, air and water, and that the fire occupies
the highest part of the sky, and the earth the lowest part, or
as it were the foundation of the world, and that therefore
earth cannot be in the heavens, how is fire in the earth?
For, according to this reasoning, these two elements, earth and
fire, ought to be so restricted to their own places, the highest
and the lowest, that neither the lowest can rise to the place
of the highest, nor the highest sink to that of the lowest.
Thus, as they think that no particle of earth is or shall ever
be in the sky, so we ought to see no particle of fire on the
earth. But the fact is that it exists to such an extent, not
only on but even under the earth, that the tops of mountains
vomit it forth; besides that we see it to exist on earth
for human uses, and even to be produced from the earth, since
it is kindled from wood and stones, which are without doubt
earthly bodies. But that [upper] fire, they say, is tranquil,
pure, harmless, eternal; but this [earthly] fire is turbid,
smoky, corruptible, and corrupting. But it does not corrupt
the mountains and caverns of the earth in which it rages
continually. But grant that the earthly fire is so unlike the
other as to suit its earthly position, why then do they object
to our believing that the nature of earthly bodies shall some
day be made incorruptible and fit for the sky, even as now
fire is corruptible and suited to the earth? They therefore
adduce from their weights and order of the elements nothing
from which they can prove that it is impossible for Almighty
God to make our bodies such that they can dwell in the
skies.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Against the calumnies with which unbelievers throw ridicule upon the Christian
faith in the resurrection of the flesh.</i></p>

<p>But their way is to feign a scrupulous anxiety in investigating
this question, and to cast ridicule on our faith in the
resurrection of the body, by asking, Whether abortions shall
rise? And as the Lord says, "Verily I say unto you, not
a hair of your head shall perish,"<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> shall all bodies have an
equal stature and strength, or shall there be differences in
size? For if there is to be equality, where shall those abortions,
supposing that they rise again, get that bulk which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
they had not here? Or if they shall not rise because they
were not born but cast out, they raise the same question
about children who have died in childhood, asking us whence
they get the stature which we see they had not here; for
we will not say that those who have been not only born, but
born again, shall not rise again. Then, further, they ask of
what size these equal bodies shall be. For if all shall be as
tall and large as were the tallest and largest in this world,
they ask us how it is that not only children but many full-grown
persons shall receive what they here did not possess,
if each one is to receive what he had here. And if the saying
of the apostle, that we are all to come to the "measure
of the age of the fulness of Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> or that other saying,
"Whom He predestinated to be conformed to the image of
His Son,"<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> is to be understood to mean that the stature and
size of Christ's body shall be the measure of the bodies of
all those who shall be in His kingdom, then, say they, the size
and height of many must be diminished; and if so much of
the bodily frame itself be lost, what becomes of the saying,
"Not a hair of your head shall perish?" Besides, it might
be asked regarding the hair itself, whether all that the barber
has cut off shall be restored? And if it is to be restored,
who would not shrink from such deformity? For as the
same restoration will be made of what has been pared off
the nails, much will be replaced on the body which a regard
for its appearance had cut off. And where, then, will be its
beauty, which assuredly ought to be much greater in that
immortal condition than it could be in this corruptible state?
On the other hand, if such things are not restored to the
body, they must perish; how, then, they say, shall not a hair
of the head perish? In like manner they reason about fatness
and leanness; for if all are to be equal, then certainly
there shall not be some fat, others lean. Some, therefore,
shall gain, others lose something. Consequently there will
not be a simple restoration of what formerly existed, but, on
the one hand, an addition of what had no existence, and, on
the other, a loss of what did before exist.</p>

<p>The difficulties, too, about the corruption and dissolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
of dead bodies,&mdash;that one is turned into dust, while another
evaporates into the air; that some are devoured by beasts,
some by fire, while some perish by shipwreck or by drowning
in one shape or other, so that their bodies decay into liquid,&mdash;these
difficulties give them immoderate alarm, and they believe
that all those dissolved elements cannot be gathered again
and reconstructed into a body. They also make eager use of all
the deformities and blemishes which either accident or birth
has produced, and accordingly, with horror and derision, cite
monstrous births, and ask if every deformity will be preserved
in the resurrection. For if we say that no such thing shall
be reproduced in the body of a man, they suppose that they
confute us by citing the marks of the wounds which we assert
were found in the risen body of the Lord Christ. But of all
these, the most difficult question is, into whose body that
flesh shall return which has been eaten and assimilated by
another man constrained by hunger to use it so; for it has
been converted into the flesh of the man who used it as his
nutriment, and it filled up those losses of flesh which famine
had produced. For the sake, then, of ridiculing the resurrection,
they ask, Shall this return to the man whose flesh
it first was, or to him whose flesh it afterwards became?
And thus, too, they seek to give promise to the human soul
of alternations of true misery and false happiness, in accordance
with Plato's theory; or, in accordance with Porphyry's,
that, after many transmigrations into different bodies, it ends
its miseries, and never more returns to them, not, however,
by obtaining an immortal body, but by escaping from every
kind of body.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether abortions, if they are numbered among the dead, shall not also
have a part in the resurrection.</i></p>

<p>To these objections, then, of our adversaries which I have
thus detailed, I will now reply, trusting that God will mercifully
assist my endeavours. That abortions, which, even supposing
they were alive in the womb, did also die there, shall
rise again, I make bold neither to affirm nor to deny, although
I fail to see why, if they are not excluded from the number
of the dead, they should not attain to the resurrection of the
dead. For either all the dead shall not rise, and there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
be to all eternity some souls without bodies, though they once
had them,&mdash;only in their mother's womb, indeed; or, if all
human souls shall receive again the bodies which they had
wherever they lived, and which they left when they died,
then I do not see how I can say that even those who died
in their mother's womb shall have no resurrection. But
whichever of these opinions any one may adopt concerning
them, we must at least apply to them, if they rise again, all
that we have to say of infants who have been born.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Whether infants shall rise in that body which they would have had had they
grown up.</i></p>

<p>What, then, are we to say of infants, if not that they will
not rise in that diminutive body in which they died, but
shall receive by the marvellous and rapid operation of God
that body which time by a slower process would have given
them? For in the Lord's words, where He says, "Not a hair
of your head shall perish,"<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> it is asserted that nothing which
was possessed shall be wanting; but it is not said that nothing
which was not possessed shall be given. To the dead infant
there was wanting the perfect stature of its body; for even
the perfect infant lacks the perfection of bodily size, being
capable of further growth. This perfect stature is, in a sense,
so possessed by all that they are conceived and born with it,&mdash;that
is, they have it potentially, though not yet in actual
bulk; just as all the members of the body are potentially in
the seed, though, even after the child is born, some of them,
the teeth for example, may be wanting. In this seminal
principle of every substance, there seems to be, as it were,
the beginning of everything which does not yet exist, or
rather does not appear, but which in process of time will
come into being, or rather into sight. In this, therefore, the
child who is to be tall or short is already tall or short. And
in the resurrection of the body, we need, for the same reason,
fear no bodily loss; for though all should be of equal size,
and reach gigantic proportions, lest the men who were largest
here should lose anything of their bulk and it should perish,
in contradiction to the words of Christ, who said that not a
hair of their head should perish, yet why should there lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
the means by which that wonderful Worker should make
such additions, seeing that He is the Creator, who Himself
created all things out of nothing?</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Whether the bodies of all the dead shall rise the same size as the Lord's
body.</i></p>

<p>It is certain that Christ rose in the same bodily stature in
which He died, and that it is wrong to say that, when the
general resurrection shall have arrived, His body shall, for the
sake of equalling the tallest, assume proportions which it had
not when He appeared to the disciples in the figure with
which they were familiar. But if we say that even the bodies
of taller men are to be reduced to the size of the Lord's body,
there will be a great loss in many bodies, though He promised
that not a hair of their head should perish. It remains,
therefore, that we conclude that every man shall receive his
own size which he had in youth, though he died an old man,
or which he would have had, supposing he died before his
prime. As for what the apostle said of the measure of the
age of the fulness of Christ, we must either understand him
to refer to something else, viz. to the fact that the measure
of Christ will be completed when all the members among the
Christian communities are added to the Head; or if we are
to refer it to the resurrection of the body, the meaning is that
all shall rise neither beyond nor under youth, but in that
vigour and age to which we know that Christ had arrived.
For even the world's wisest men have fixed the bloom of
youth at about the age of thirty; and when this period has
been passed, the man begins to decline towards the defective
and duller period of old age. And therefore the apostle did
not speak of the measure of the body, nor of the measure of
the stature, but of "the measure of the age of the fulness of
Christ."</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>What is meant by the conforming of the saints to the image of the Son of
God.</i></p>

<p>Then, again, these words, "Predestinate to be conformed to
the image of the Son of God,"<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> may be understood of the
inner man. So in another place He says to us, "Be not conformed
to this world, but be ye transformed in the renewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
of your mind."<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> In so far, then, as we are transformed so as
not to be conformed to the world, we are conformed to the
Son of God. It may also be understood thus, that as He
was conformed to us by assuming mortality, we shall be conformed
to Him by immortality; and this indeed is connected
with the resurrection of the body. But if we are also taught
in these words what form our bodies shall rise in, as the measure
we spoke of before, so also this conformity is to be understood
not of size, but of age. Accordingly all shall rise in
the stature they either had attained or would have attained
had they lived to their prime, although it will be no great
disadvantage even if the form of the body be infantine or
aged, while no infirmity shall remain in the mind nor in the
body itself. So that even if any one contends that every person
will rise again in the same bodily form in which he died, we
need not spend much labour in disputing with him.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Whether the bodies of women shall retain their own sex in the resurrection.</i></p>

<p>From the words, "Till we all come to a perfect man, to the
measure of the age of the fulness of Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> and from the
words, "Conformed to the image of the Son of God,"<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> some
conclude that women shall not rise women, but that all shall
be men, because God made man only of earth, and woman of
the man. For my part, they seem to be wiser who make no
doubt that both sexes shall rise. For there shall be no lust,
which is now the cause of confusion. For before they sinned,
the man and the woman were naked, and were not ashamed.
From those bodies, then, vice shall be withdrawn, while nature
shall be preserved. And the sex of woman is not a vice,
but nature. It shall then indeed be superior to carnal intercourse
and child-bearing; nevertheless the female members
shall remain adapted not to the old uses, but to a new beauty,
which, so far from provoking lust, now extinct, shall excite
praise to the wisdom and clemency of God, who both made
what was not and delivered from corruption what He made.
For at the beginning of the human race the woman was made
of a rib taken from the side of the man while he slept; for
it seemed fit that even then Christ and His Church should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
be foreshadowed in this event. For that sleep of the man
was the death of Christ, whose side, as He hung lifeless upon
the cross, was pierced with a spear, and there flowed from it
blood and water, and these we know to be the sacraments by
which the Church is "built up." For Scripture used this very
word, not saying "He formed" or "framed," but "built her
up into a woman;"<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> whence also the apostle speaks of the
<i>edification</i> of the body of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> which is the Church. The
woman, therefore, is a creature of God even as the man; but
by her creation from man unity is commended; and the
manner of her creation prefigured, as has been said, Christ and
the Church. He, then, who created both sexes will restore
both. Jesus Himself also, when asked by the Sadducees, who
denied the resurrection, which of the seven brothers should
have to wife the woman whom all in succession had taken to
raise up seed to their brother, as the law enjoined, says, "Ye
do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>
And though it was a fit opportunity for His saying, She
about whom you make inquiries shall herself be a man, and
not a woman, He said nothing of the kind; but "In the
resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels of God in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> They shall be
equal to the angels in immortality and happiness, not in flesh,
nor in resurrection, which the angels did not need, because
they could not die. The Lord then denied that there would
be in the resurrection, not women, but marriages; and He
uttered this denial in circumstances in which the question
mooted would have been more easily and speedily solved by
denying that the female sex would exist, if this had in truth
been foreknown by Him. But, indeed, He even affirmed that
the sex should exist by saying, "They shall not be given in
marriage," which can only apply to females; "Neither shall
they marry," which applies to males. There shall therefore
be those who are in this world accustomed to marry and
be given in marriage, only they shall there make no such
marriages.</p>

<p class="center">18. <i>Of the perfect Man, that is, Christ; and of His body, that is, the Church,
which is His fulness.</i></p>

<p>To understand what the apostle means when he says that
we shall all come to a perfect man, we must consider the connection
of the whole passage, which runs thus: "He that descended
is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens,
that He might fill all things. And He gave some, apostles;
and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of
the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we
all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son
of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children,
tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait
to deceive; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up
in Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from
whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
body, unto the edifying of itself in love."<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> Behold what the
perfect man is&mdash;the head and the body, which is made up of
all the members, which in their own time shall be perfected.
But new additions are daily being made to this body while
the Church is being built up, to which it is said, "Ye are the
body of Christ and His members;"<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> and again, "For His body's
sake," he says, "which is the Church;"<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> and again, "We being
many are one head, one body."<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> It is of the edification of
this body that it is here, too, said, "For the perfecting of the
saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the
body of Christ;" and then that passage of which we are now
speaking is added, "Till we all come to the unity of the faith
and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the
measure of the age of the fulness of Christ," and so on. And
he shows of what body we are to understand this to be the
measure, when he says, "That we may grow up into Him in
all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which
every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the
measure of every part." As, therefore, there is a measure of
every part, so there is a measure of the fulness of the whole
body which is made up of all its parts, and it is of this measure
it is said, "To the measure of the age of the fulness of
Christ." This fulness he spoke of also in the place where he
says of Christ, "And gave Him to be the Head over all things
to the Church,<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> which is His body, the fulness of Him that
filleth all in all."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> But even if this should be referred to the
form in which each one shall rise, what should hinder us from
applying to the woman what is expressly said of the man,
understanding both sexes to be included under the general
term "man?" For certainly in the saying, "Blessed is he
who feareth the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> women also who fear the Lord are
included.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>19. <i>That all bodily blemishes which mar human beauty in this life shall be removed
in the resurrection, the natural substance of the body remaining,
but the quality and quantity of it being altered so as to produce beauty.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What am I to say now about the hair and nails? Once it
is understood that no part of the body shall so perish as
to produce deformity in the body, it is at the same time
understood that such things as would have produced a deformity
by their excessive proportions shall be added to the
total bulk of the body, not to parts in which the beauty of
the proportion would thus be marred. Just as if, after making
a vessel of clay, one wished to make it over again of the same
clay, it would not be necessary that the same portion of the
clay which had formed the handle should again form the new
handle, or that what had formed the bottom should again do
so, but only that the whole clay should go to make up the
whole new vessel, and that no part of it should be left unused.
Wherefore, if the hair that has been cropped and the nails
that have been cut would cause a deformity were they to be
restored to their places, they shall not be restored; and yet
no one will lose these parts at the resurrection, for they shall
be changed into the same flesh, their substance being so altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
as to preserve the proportion of the various parts of the body.
However, what our Lord said, "Not a hair of your head shall
perish," might more suitably be interpreted of the number,
and not of the length of the hairs, as He elsewhere says, "The
hairs of your head are all numbered."<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> Nor would I say this
because I suppose that any part naturally belonging to the
body can perish, but that whatever deformity was in it, and
served to exhibit the penal condition in which we mortals are,
should be restored in such a way that, while the substance is
entirely preserved, the deformity shall perish. For if even a
human workman, who has, for some reason, made a deformed
statue, can recast it and make it very beautiful, and this without
suffering any part of the substance, but only the deformity
to be lost,&mdash;if he can, for example, remove some unbecoming
or disproportionate part, not by cutting off and separating this
part from the whole, but by so breaking down and mixing up
the whole as to get rid of the blemish without diminishing
the quantity of his material,&mdash;shall we not think as highly of
the almighty Worker? Shall He not be able to remove and
abolish all deformities of the human body, whether common
ones or rare and monstrous, which, though in keeping with
this miserable life, are yet not to be thought of in connection
with that future blessedness; and shall He not be able
so to remove them that, while the natural but unseemly
blemishes are put an end to, the natural substance shall
suffer no diminution?</p>

<p>And consequently overgrown and emaciated persons need
not fear that they shall be in heaven of such a figure as
they would not be even in this world if they could help it.
For all bodily beauty consists in the proportion of the parts,
together with a certain agreeableness of colour. Where there
is no proportion, the eye is offended, either because there is
something awanting, or too small, or too large. And thus
there shall be no deformity resulting from want of proportion
in that state in which all that is wrong is corrected, and all
that is defective supplied from resources the Creator wots of,
and all that is excessive removed without destroying the integrity
of the substance. And as for the pleasant colour, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
conspicuous shall it be where "the just shall shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father!"<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> This brightness
we must rather believe to have been concealed from the eyes
of the disciples when Christ rose, than to have been awanting.
For weak human eyesight could not bear it, and it was necessary
that they should so look upon Him as to be able to
recognise Him. For this purpose also He allowed them to
touch the marks of His wounds, and also ate and drank,&mdash;not
because He needed nourishment, but because He could take it
if He wished. Now, when an object, though present, is invisible
to persons who see other things which are present, as
we say that that brightness was present but invisible by those
who saw other things, this is called in Greek &#7936;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;; and our
Latin translators, for want of a better word, have rendered
this <i>cæcitas</i> (blindness) in the book of Genesis. This blindness
the men of Sodom suffered when they sought the just
Lot's gate and could not find it. But if it had been blindness,
that is to say, if they could see nothing, then they would not
have asked for the gate by which they might enter the house,
but for guides who might lead them away.</p>

<p>But the love we bear to the blessed martyrs causes us, I
know not how, to desire to see in the heavenly kingdom the
marks of the wounds which they received for the name of
Christ, and possibly we shall see them. For this will not be
a deformity, but a mark of honour, and will add lustre to their
appearance, and a spiritual, if not a bodily beauty. And yet
we need not believe that they to whom it has been said, "Not a
hair of your head shall perish," shall, in the resurrection, want
such of their members as they have been deprived of in their
martyrdom. But if it will be seemly in that new kingdom
to have some marks of these wounds still visible in that immortal
flesh, the places where they have been wounded or mutilated
shall retain the scars without any of the members being
lost. While, therefore, it is quite true that no blemishes
which the body has sustained shall appear in the resurrection,
yet we are not to reckon or name these marks of virtue
blemishes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">20. <i>That, in the resurrection, the substance of our bodies, however disintegrated,
shall be entirely reunited.</i></p>

<p>Far be it from us to fear that the omnipotence of the Creator
cannot, for the resuscitation and reanimation of our bodies,
recall all the portions which have been consumed by beasts or
fire, or have been dissolved into dust or ashes, or have decomposed
into water, or evaporated into the air. Far from us be
the thought, that anything which escapes our observation in any
most hidden recess of nature either evades the knowledge or
transcends the power of the Creator of all things. Cicero, the
great authority of our adversaries, wishing to define God as
accurately as possible, says, "God is a mind free and independent,
without materiality, perceiving and moving all things,
and itself endowed with eternal movement."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> This he found
in the systems of the greatest philosophers. Let me ask, then,
in their own language, how anything can either lie hid from
Him who perceives all things, or irrevocably escape Him who
moves all things?</p>

<p>This leads me to reply to that question which seems the
most difficult of all,&mdash;To whom, in the resurrection, will belong
the flesh of a dead man which has become the flesh of a living
man? For if some one, famishing for want and pressed with
hunger, use human flesh as food,&mdash;an extremity not unknown,
as both ancient history and the unhappy experience of our own
days have taught us,&mdash;can it be contended, with any show of
reason, that all the flesh eaten has been evacuated, and that
none of it has been assimilated to the substance of the eater,
though the very emaciation which existed before, and has now
disappeared, sufficiently indicates what large deficiencies have
been filled up with this food? But I have already made some
remarks which will suffice for the solution of this difficulty
also. For all the flesh which hunger has consumed finds its
way into the air by evaporation, whence, as we have said, God
Almighty can recall it. That flesh, therefore, shall be restored
to the man in whom it first became human flesh. For it must
be looked upon as borrowed by the other person, and, like a
pecuniary loan, must be returned to the lender. His own
flesh, however, which he lost by famine, shall be restored to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
him by Him who can recover even what has evaporated. And
though it had been absolutely annihilated, so that no part of
its substance remained in any secret spot of nature, the
Almighty could restore it by such means as He saw fit.
For this sentence, uttered by the Truth, "Not a hair of your
head shall perish," forbids us to suppose that, though no hair
of a man's head can perish, yet the large portions of his flesh
eaten and consumed by the famishing can perish.</p>

<p>From all that we have thus considered, and discussed with
such poor ability as we can command, we gather this conclusion,
that in the resurrection of the flesh the body shall be
of that size which it either had attained or should have
attained in the flower of its youth, and shall enjoy the
beauty that arises from preserving symmetry and proportion
in all its members. And it is reasonable to suppose that, for
the preservation of this beauty, any part of the body's substance,
which, if placed in one spot, would produce a deformity,
shall be distributed through the whole of it, so that neither
any part, nor the symmetry of the whole, may be lost, but
only the general stature of the body somewhat increased by
the distribution in all the parts of that which, in one place,
would have been unsightly. Or if it is contended that each
will rise with the same stature as that of the body he died in,
we shall not obstinately dispute this, provided only there be
no deformity, no infirmity, no languor, no corruption,&mdash;nothing
of any kind which would ill become that kingdom in which the
children of the resurrection and of the promise shall be equal to
the angels of God, if not in body and age, at least in happiness.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the new spiritual body into which the flesh of the saints shall be
transformed.</i></p>

<p>Whatever, therefore, has been taken from the body, either
during life or after death, shall be restored to it, and, in conjunction
with what has remained in the grave, shall rise
again, transformed from the oldness of the animal body into
the newness of the spiritual body, and clothed in incorruption
and immortality. But even though the body has been all
quite ground to powder by some severe accident, or by the
ruthlessness of enemies, and though it has been so diligently
scattered to the winds, or into the water, that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
trace of it left, yet it shall not be beyond the omnipotence of
the Creator,&mdash;no, not a hair of its head shall perish. The
flesh shall then be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, but still
flesh, not spirit, as the spirit itself, when subject to the flesh,
was fleshly, but still spirit and not flesh. And of this we
have experimental proof in the deformity of our penal condition.
For those persons were carnal, not in a fleshly, but in a spiritual
way, to whom the apostle said, "I could not speak to
you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal."<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> And a man is in
this life spiritual in such a way, that he is yet carnal with
respect to his body, and sees another law in his members
warring against the law of his mind; but even in his body
he will be spiritual when the same flesh shall have had that
resurrection of which these words speak, "It is sown an
animal body, it shall rise a spiritual body."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> But what this
spiritual body shall be, and how great its grace, I fear it were
but rash to pronounce, seeing that we have as yet no experience
of it. Nevertheless, since it is fit that the joyfulness of
our hope should utter itself, and so show forth God's praise,
and since it was from the profoundest sentiment of ardent and
holy love that the Psalmist cried, "O Lord, I have loved the
beauty of Thy house,"<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> we may, with God's help, speak of the
gifts He lavishes on men, good and bad alike, in this most
wretched life, and may do our best to conjecture the great
glory of that state which we cannot worthily speak of, because
we have not yet experienced it. For I say nothing of the
time when God made man upright; I say nothing of the
happy life of "the man and his wife" in the fruitful garden,
since it was so short that none of their children experienced
it: I speak only of this life which we know, and in which we
now are, from the temptations of which we cannot escape so
long as we are in it, no matter what progress we make, for it
is all temptation, and I ask, Who can describe the tokens of
God's goodness that are extended to the human race even in
this life?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>22. <i>Of the miseries and ills to which the human race is justly exposed through
the first sin, and from which none can be delivered save by Christ's grace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>That the whole human race has been condemned in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
first origin, this life itself, if life it is to be called, bears
witness by the host of cruel ills with which it is filled. Is
not this proved by the profound and dreadful ignorance which
produces all the errors that enfold the children of Adam, and
from which no man can be delivered without toil, pain, and
fear? Is it not proved by his love of so many vain and
hurtful things, which produces gnawing cares, disquiet, griefs,
fears, wild joys, quarrels, law-suits, wars, treasons, angers,
hatreds, deceit, flattery, fraud, theft, robbery, perfidy, pride,
ambition, envy, murders, parricides, cruelty, ferocity, wickedness,
luxury, insolence, impudence, shamelessness, fornications,
adulteries, incests, and the numberless uncleannesses and unnatural
acts of both sexes, which it is shameful so much as to
mention; sacrileges, heresies, blasphemies, perjuries, oppression
of the innocent, calumnies, plots, falsehoods, false witnessings,
unrighteous judgments, violent deeds, plunderings, and
whatever similar wickedness has found its way into the lives
of men, though it cannot find its way into the conception of
pure minds? These are indeed the crimes of wicked men, yet
they spring from that root of error and misplaced love which
is born with every son of Adam. For who is there that has
not observed with what profound ignorance, manifesting itself
even in infancy, and with what superfluity of foolish desires,
beginning to appear in boyhood, man comes into this life, so
that, were he left to live as he pleased, and to do whatever he
pleased, he would plunge into all, or certainly into many of
those crimes and iniquities which I mentioned, and could not
mention?</p>

<p>But because God does not wholly desert those whom He
condemns, nor shuts up in His anger His tender mercies, the
human race is restrained by law and instruction, which keep
guard against the ignorance that besets us, and oppose the
assaults of vice, but are themselves full of labour and sorrow.
For what mean those multifarious threats which are used to
restrain the folly of children? What mean pedagogues,
masters, the birch, the strap, the cane, the schooling which
Scripture says must be given a child, "beating him on the
sides lest he wax stubborn,"<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> and it be hardly possible or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
possible at all to subdue him? Why all these punishments,
save to overcome ignorance and bridle evil desires&mdash;these
evils with which we come into the world? For why is it that
we remember with difficulty, and without difficulty forget?
learn with difficulty, and without difficulty remain ignorant?
are diligent with difficulty, and without difficulty are indolent?
Does not this show what vitiated nature inclines and
tends to by its own weight, and what succour it needs if it is
to be delivered? Inactivity, sloth, laziness, negligence, are
vices which shun labour, since labour, though useful, is itself
a punishment.</p>

<p>But, besides the punishments of childhood, without which
there would be no learning of what the parents wish,&mdash;and
the parents rarely wish anything useful to be taught,&mdash;who
can describe, who can conceive the number and severity of
the punishments which afflict the human race,&mdash;pains which
are not only the accompaniment of the wickedness of godless
men, but are a part of the human condition and the common
misery,&mdash;what fear and what grief are caused by bereavement
and mourning, by losses and condemnations, by fraud and
falsehood, by false suspicions, and all the crimes and wicked
deeds of other men? For at their hands we suffer robbery,
captivity, chains, imprisonment, exile, torture, mutilation, loss
of sight, the violation of chastity to satisfy the lust of the
oppressor, and many other dreadful evils. What numberless
casualties threaten our bodies from without,&mdash;extremes of
heat and cold, storms, floods, inundations, lightning, thunder,
hail, earthquakes, houses falling; or from the stumbling, or
shying, or vice of horses; from countless poisons in fruits,
water, air, animals; from the painful or even deadly bites of
wild animals; from the madness which a mad dog communicates,
so that even the animal which of all others is most
gentle and friendly to its own master, becomes an object of
intenser fear than a lion or dragon, and the man whom it has
by chance infected with this pestilential contagion becomes so
rabid, that his parents, wife, children, dread him more than
any wild beast! What disasters are suffered by those who
travel by land or sea! What man can go out of his own
house without being exposed on all hands to unforeseen accidents?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
Returning home sound in limb, he slips on his own
door-step, breaks his leg, and never recovers. What can seem
safer than a man sitting in his chair? Eli the priest fell
from his, and broke his neck. How many accidents do
farmers, or rather all men, fear that the crops may suffer from
the weather, or the soil, or the ravages of destructive animals?
Commonly they feel safe when the crops are gathered and
housed. Yet, to my certain knowledge, sudden floods have
driven the labourers away, and swept the barns clean of the
finest harvest. Is innocence a sufficient protection against the
various assaults of demons? That no man might think so,
even baptized infants, who are certainly unsurpassed in innocence,
are sometimes so tormented, that God, who permits it,
teaches us hereby to bewail the calamities of this life, and to
desire the felicity of the life to come. As to bodily diseases,
they are so numerous that they cannot all be contained even
in medical books. And in very many, or almost all of them,
the cures and remedies are themselves tortures, so that men
are delivered from a pain that destroys by a cure that pains.
Has not the madness of thirst driven men to drink human
urine, and even their own? Has not hunger driven men to
eat human flesh, and that the flesh not of bodies found dead,
but of bodies slain for the purpose? Have not the fierce
pangs of famine driven mothers to eat their own children,
incredibly savage as it seems? In line, sleep itself, which is
justly called repose, how little of repose there sometimes is
in it when disturbed with dreams and visions; and with what
terror is the wretched mind overwhelmed by the appearances of
things which are so presented, and which, as it were, so stand
out before the senses, that we cannot distinguish them from
realities! How wretchedly do false appearances distract men
in certain diseases! With what astonishing variety of appearances
are even healthy men sometimes deceived by evil spirits,
who produce these delusions for the sake of perplexing the
senses of their victims, if they cannot succeed in seducing
them to their side!</p>

<p>From this hell upon earth there is no escape, save through
the grace of the Saviour Christ, our God and Lord. The very
name Jesus shows this, for it means Saviour; and He saves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
us especially from passing out of this life into a more wretched
and eternal state, which is rather a death than a life. For in
this life, though holy men and holy pursuits afford us great
consolations, yet the blessings which men crave are not invariably
bestowed upon them, lest religion should be cultivated
for the sake of these temporal advantages, while it ought
rather to be cultivated for the sake of that other life from
which all evil is excluded. Therefore, also, does grace aid
good men in the midst of present calamities, so that they are
enabled to endure them with a constancy proportioned to
their faith. The world's sages affirm that philosophy contributes
something to this,&mdash;that philosophy which, according
to Cicero, the gods have bestowed in its purity only on a few
men. They have never given, he says, nor can ever give, a
greater gift to men. So that even those against whom we
are disputing have been compelled to acknowledge, in some
fashion, that the grace of God is necessary for the acquisition,
not, indeed, of any philosophy, but of the true philosophy.
And if the true philosophy&mdash;this sole support against the
miseries of this life&mdash;has been given by Heaven only to a few,
it sufficiently appears from this that the human race has been
condemned to pay this penalty of wretchedness. And as,
according to their acknowledgment, no greater gift has been
bestowed by God, so it must be believed that it could be
given only by that God whom they themselves recognise as
greater than all the gods they worship.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the miseries of this life which attach peculiarly to the toil of good men,
irrespective of those which are common to the good and bad.</i></p>

<p>But, irrespective of the miseries which in this life are
common to the good and bad, the righteous undergo labours
peculiar to themselves, in so far as they make war upon their
vices, and are involved in the temptations and perils of such
a contest. For though sometimes more violent and at other
times slacker, yet without intermission does the flesh lust
against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, so that we
cannot do the things we would,<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> and extirpate all lust, but
can only refuse consent to it, as God gives us ability, and so
keep it under, vigilantly keeping watch lest a semblance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
truth deceive us, lest a subtle discourse blind us, lest error
involve us in darkness, lest we should take good for evil or
evil for good, lest fear should hinder us from doing what we
ought, or desire precipitate us into doing what we ought not,
lest the sun go down upon our wrath, lest hatred provoke us
to render evil for evil, lest unseemly or immoderate grief
consume us, lest an ungrateful disposition make us slow to
recognise benefits received, lest calumnies fret our conscience,
lest rash suspicion on our part deceive us regarding a friend,
or false suspicion of us on the part of others give us too much
uneasiness, lest sin reign in our mortal body to obey its
desires, lest our members be used as the instruments of unrighteousness,
lest the eye follow lust, lest thirst for revenge
carry us away, lest sight or thought dwell too long on some
evil thing which gives us pleasure, lest wicked or indecent
language be willingly listened to, lest we do what is pleasant
but unlawful, and lest in this warfare, filled so abundantly
with toil and peril, we either hope to secure victory by our
own strength, or attribute it when secured to our own strength,
and not to His grace of whom the apostle says, "Thanks be
unto God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> and in another place he says, "In all these things
we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>
But yet we are to know this, that however valorously we
resist our vices, and however successful we are in overcoming
them, yet as long as we are in this body we have always
reason to say to God, "Forgive us our debts."<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> But in that
kingdom where we shall dwell for ever, clothed in immortal
bodies, we shall no longer have either conflicts or debts,&mdash;as
indeed we should not have had at any time or in any condition,
had our nature continued upright as it was created.
Consequently even this our conflict, in which we are exposed
to peril, and from which we hope to be delivered by a final
victory, belongs to the ills of this life, which is proved by the
witness of so many grave evils to be a life under condemnation.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the blessings with which the Creator has filled this life, obnoxious
though it be to the curse.</i></p>

<p>But we must now contemplate the rich and countless blessings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
with which the goodness of God, who cares for all He
has created, has filled this very misery of the human race,
which reflects His retributive justice. That first blessing
which He pronounced before the fall, when He said, "Increase,
and multiply, and replenish the earth,"<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> He did not
inhibit after man had sinned, but the fecundity originally bestowed
remained in the condemned stock; and the vice of sin,
which has involved us in the necessity of dying, has yet not
deprived us of that wonderful power of seed, or rather of that
still more marvellous power by which seed is produced, and
which seems to be as it were inwrought and inwoven in the
human body. But in this river, as I may call it, or torrent
of the human race, both elements are carried along together,&mdash;both
the evil which is derived from him who begets, and the
good which is bestowed by Him who creates us. In the
original evil there are two things, sin and punishment; in the
original good, there are two other things, propagation and
conformation. But of the evils, of which the one, sin, arose
from our audacity, and the other, punishment, from God's
judgment, we have already said as much as suits our present
purpose. I mean now to speak of the blessings which God
has conferred or still confers upon our nature, vitiated and
condemned as it is. For in condemning it He did not withdraw
all that He had given it, else it had been annihilated;
neither did He, in penally subjecting it to the devil, remove
it beyond His own power; for not even the devil himself is
outside of God's government, since the devil's nature subsists
only by the supreme Creator, who gives being to all that in
any form exists.</p>

<p>Of these two blessings, then, which we have said flow from
God's goodness, as from a fountain, towards our nature, vitiated
by sin and condemned to punishment, the one, propagation,
was conferred by God's benediction when He made those first
works, from which He rested on the seventh day. But the
other, conformation, is conferred in that work of His wherein
"He worketh hitherto."<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> For were He to withdraw His efficacious
power from things, they should neither be able to go
on and complete the periods assigned to their measured movements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
nor should they even continue in possession of that
nature they were created in. God, then, so created man that
He gave him what we may call fertility, whereby he might
propagate other men, giving them a congenital capacity to
propagate their kind, but not imposing on them any necessity
to do so. This capacity God withdraws at pleasure from individuals,
making them barren; but from the whole race He
has not withdrawn the blessing of propagation once conferred.
But though not withdrawn on account of sin, this power of
propagation is not what it would have been had there been
no sin. For since "man placed in honour fell, he has become
like the beasts,"<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> and generates as they do, though the little
spark of reason, which was the image of God in him, has not
been quite quenched. But if conformation were not added
to propagation, there would be no reproduction of one's kind.
For even though there were no such thing as copulation, and
God wished to fill the earth with human inhabitants, He
might create all these as He created one without the help
of human generation. And, indeed, even as it is, those who
copulate can generate nothing save by the creative energy
of God. As, therefore, in respect of that spiritual growth
whereby a man is formed to piety and righteousness, the
apostle says, "Neither is he that planteth anything, neither
he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase,"<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> so also
it must be said that it is not he that generates that is anything,
but God that giveth the essential form; that it is not
the mother who carries and nurses the fruit of her womb that
is anything, but God that giveth the increase. For He alone,
by that energy wherewith "He worketh hitherto," causes the
seed to develope, and to evolve from certain secret and invisible
folds into the visible forms of beauty which we see.
He alone, coupling and connecting in some wonderful fashion
the spiritual and corporeal natures, the one to command, the
other to obey, makes a living being. And this work of His
is so great and wonderful, that not only man, who is a rational
animal, and consequently more excellent than all other animals
of the earth, but even the most diminutive insect, cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
considered attentively without astonishment and without praising
the Creator.</p>

<p>It is He, then, who has given to the human soul a mind,
in which reason and understanding lie as it were asleep during
infancy, and as if they were not, destined, however, to be
awakened and exercised as years increase, so as to become
capable of knowledge and of receiving instruction, fit to understand
what is true and to love what is good. It is by this
capacity the soul drinks in wisdom, and becomes endowed
with those virtues by which, in prudence, fortitude, temperance,
and righteousness, it makes war upon error and the
other inborn vices, and conquers them by fixing its desires
upon no other object than the supreme and unchangeable
Good. And even though this be not uniformly the result, yet
who can competently utter or even conceive the grandeur of
this work of the Almighty, and the unspeakable boon He has
conferred upon our rational nature, by giving us even the
capacity of such attainment? For over and above those arts
which are called virtues, and which teach us how we may
spend our life well, and attain to endless happiness,&mdash;arts
which are given to the children of the promise and the kingdom
by the sole grace of God which is in Christ,&mdash;has not
the genius of man invented and applied countless astonishing
arts, partly the result of necessity, partly the result of
exuberant invention, so that this vigour of mind, which is so
active in the discovery not merely of superfluous but even of
dangerous and destructive things, betokens an inexhaustible
wealth in the nature which can invent, learn, or employ such
arts? What wonderful&mdash;one might say stupefying&mdash;advances
has human industry made in the arts of weaving and building,
of agriculture and navigation! With what endless variety
are designs in pottery, painting, and sculpture produced, and
with what skill executed! What wonderful spectacles are
exhibited in the theatres, which those who have not seen
them cannot credit! How skilful the contrivances for catching,
killing, or taming wild beasts! And for the injury of
men, also, how many kinds of poisons, weapons, engines of
destruction, have been invented, while for the preservation or
restoration of health the appliances and remedies are infinite!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
To provoke appetite and please the palate, what a variety of
seasonings have been concocted! To express and gain entrance
for thoughts, what a multitude and variety of signs there are,
among which speaking and writing hold the first place! what
ornaments has eloquence at command to delight the mind!
what wealth of song is there to captivate the ear! how many
musical instruments and strains of harmony have been devised!
What skill has been attained in measures and
numbers! with what sagacity have the movements and connections
of the stars been discovered! Who could tell the
thought that has been spent upon nature, even though, despairing
of recounting it in detail, he endeavoured only to give
a general view of it? In fine, even the defence of errors and
misapprehensions, which has illustrated the genius of heretics
and philosophers, cannot be sufficiently declared. For at
present it is the nature of the human mind which adorns this
mortal life which we are extolling, and not the faith and the
way of truth which lead to immortality. And since this
great nature has certainly been created by the true and
supreme God, who administers all things He has made with
absolute power and justice, it could never have fallen into
these miseries, nor have gone out of them to miseries eternal,&mdash;saving
only those who are redeemed,&mdash;had not an exceeding
great sin been found in the first man from whom the rest
have sprung.</p>

<p>Moreover, even in the body, though it dies like that of the
beasts, and is in many ways weaker than theirs, what goodness
of God, what providence of the great Creator, is apparent!
The organs of sense and the rest of the members, are not they
so placed, the appearance, and form, and stature of the body
as a whole, is it not so fashioned, as to indicate that it was
made for the service of a reasonable soul? Man has not been
created stooping towards the earth, like the irrational animals;
but his bodily form, erect and looking heavenwards, admonishes
him to mind the things that are above. Then the marvellous
nimbleness which has been given to the tongue and
the hands, fitting them to speak, and write, and execute so
many duties, and practise so many arts, does it not prove the
excellence of the soul for which such an assistant was provided?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
And even apart from its adaptation to the work
required of it, there is such a symmetry in its various parts,
and so beautiful a proportion maintained, that one is at a loss
to decide whether, in creating the body, greater regard was
paid to utility or to beauty. Assuredly no part of the body
has been created for the sake of utility which does not also
contribute something to its beauty. And this would be all
the more apparent, if we knew more precisely how all its
parts are connected and adapted to one another, and were not
limited in our observations to what appears on the surface;
for as to what is covered up and hidden from our view, the
intricate web of veins and nerves, the vital parts of all that
lies under the skin, no one can discover it. For although,
with a cruel zeal for science, some medical men, who are
called anatomists, have dissected the bodies of the dead, and
sometimes even of sick persons who died under their knives,
and have inhumanly pried into the secrets of the human body
to learn the nature of the disease and its exact seat, and how
it might be cured, yet those relations of which I speak, and
which form the concord,<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> or, as the Greeks call it, "harmony,"
of the whole body outside and in, as of some instrument, no
one has been able to discover, because no one has been audacious
enough to seek for them. But if these could be known,
then even the inward parts, which seem to have no beauty,
would so delight us with their exquisite fitness, as to afford a
profounder satisfaction to the mind&mdash;and the eyes are but its
ministers&mdash;than the obvious beauty which gratifies the eye.
There are some things, too, which have such a place in the
body, that they obviously serve no useful purpose, but are
solely for beauty, as <i>e.g.</i> the teats on a man's breast, or the
beard on his face; for that this is for ornament, and not for
protection, is proved by the bare faces of women, who ought
rather, as the weaker sex, to enjoy such a defence. If, therefore,
of all those members which are exposed to our view,
there is certainly not one in which beauty is sacrificed to
utility, while there are some which serve no purpose but only
beauty, I think it can readily be concluded that in the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
of the human body comeliness was more regarded than
necessity. In truth, necessity is a transitory thing; and the
time is coming when we shall enjoy one another's beauty
without any lust,&mdash;a condition which will specially redound
to the praise of the Creator, who, as it is said in the psalm,
has "put on praise and comeliness."<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p>How can I tell of the rest of creation, with all its beauty
and utility, which the divine goodness has given to man to
please his eye and serve his purposes, condemned though he
is, and hurled into these labours and miseries? Shall I speak
of the manifold and various loveliness of sky, and earth, and
sea; of the plentiful supply and wonderful qualities of the
light; of sun, moon, and stars; of the shade of trees; of the
colours and perfume of flowers; of the multitude of birds,
all differing in plumage and in song; of the variety of animals,
of which the smallest in size are often the most wonderful,&mdash;the
works of ants and bees astonishing us more than
the huge bodies of whales? Shall I speak of the sea, which
itself is so grand a spectacle, when it arrays itself as it were
in vestures of various colours, now running through every
shade of green, and again becoming purple or blue? Is it not
delightful to look at it in storm, and experience the soothing
complacency which it inspires, by suggesting that we ourselves
are not tossed and shipwrecked?<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> What shall I say of the
numberless kinds of food to alleviate hunger, and the variety
of seasonings to stimulate appetite which are scattered everywhere
by nature, and for which we are not indebted to the art
of cookery? How many natural appliances are there for preserving
and restoring health! How grateful is the alternation
of day and night! how pleasant the breezes that cool the air!
how abundant the supply of clothing furnished us by trees
and animals! Who can enumerate all the blessings we enjoy?
If I were to attempt to detail and unfold only these few
which I have indicated in the mass, such an enumeration
would fill a volume. And all these are but the solace of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
wretched and condemned, not the rewards of the blessed.
What then shall these rewards be, if such be the blessings of a
condemned state? What will He give to those whom He has
predestined to life, who has given such things even to those
whom He has predestined to death? What blessings will He
in the blessed life shower upon those for whom, even in this
state of misery, He has been willing that His only-begotten
Son should endure such sufferings even to death? Thus the
apostle reasons concerning those who are predestined to that
kingdom: "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also give us
all things?"<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> When this promise is fulfilled, what shall we
be? What blessings shall we receive in that kingdom, since
already we have received as the pledge of them Christ's dying?
In what condition shall the spirit of man be, when it has no
longer any vice at all; when it neither yields to any, nor is
in bondage to any, nor has to make war against any, but is
perfected, and enjoys undisturbed peace with itself? Shall
it not then know all things with certainty, and without any
labour or error, when unhindered and joyfully it drinks the
wisdom of God at the fountainhead? What shall the body
be, when it is in every respect subject to the spirit, from
which it shall draw a life so sufficient, as to stand in need of
no other nutriment? For it shall no longer be animal, but
spiritual, having indeed the substance of flesh, but without
any fleshly corruption.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>Of the obstinacy of those individuals who impugn the resurrection of the body,
though, as was predicted, the whole world believes it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The foremost of the philosophers agree with us about the
spiritual felicity enjoyed by the blessed in the life to come;
it is only the resurrection of the flesh they call in question,
and with all their might deny. But the mass of men, learned
and unlearned, the world's wise men and its fools, have believed,
and have left in meagre isolation the unbelievers, and
have turned to Christ, who in His own resurrection demonstrated
the reality of that which seems to our adversaries
absurd. For the world has believed this which God predicted,
as it was also predicted that the world would believe,&mdash;a prediction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
not due to the sorceries of Peter,<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> since it was uttered
so long before. He who has predicted these things, as I have
already said, and am not ashamed to repeat, is the God before
whom all other divinities tremble, as Porphyry himself owns,
and seeks to prove, by testimonies from the oracles of these
gods, and goes so far as to call Him God the Father and King.
Far be it from us to interpret these predictions as they do who
have not believed, along with the whole world, in that which
it was predicted the world would believe in. For why should
we not rather understand them as the world does, whose
belief was predicted, and leave that handful of unbelievers to
their idle talk and obstinate and solitary infidelity? For if
they maintain that they interpret them differently only to
avoid charging Scripture with folly, and so doing an injury
to that God to whom they bear so notable a testimony, is it
not a much greater injury they do Him when they say that
His predictions must be understood otherwise than the world
believed them, though He Himself praised, promised, accomplished
this belief on the world's part? And why cannot He
cause the body to rise again, and live for ever? or is it not
to be believed that He will do this, because it is an undesirable
thing, and unworthy of God? Of His omnipotence, which
effects so many great miracles, we have already said enough.
If they wish to know what the Almighty cannot do, I shall
tell them He cannot lie. Let us therefore believe what He
can do, by refusing to believe what He cannot do. Refusing
to believe that He can lie, let them believe that He will do
what He has promised to do; and let them believe it as the
world has believed it, whose faith He predicted, whose faith
He praised, whose faith He promised, whose faith He now
points to. But how do they prove that the resurrection is an
undesirable thing? There shall then be no corruption, which
is the only evil thing about the body. I have already said
enough about the order of the elements, and the other fanciful
objections men raise; and in the thirteenth book I have, in
my own judgment, sufficiently illustrated the facility of movement
which the incorruptible body shall enjoy, judging from
the ease and vigour we experience even now, when the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
is in good health. Those who have either not read the former
books, or wish to refresh their memory, may read them for
themselves.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>That the opinion of Porphyry, that the soul, in order to be blessed, must be
separated from every kind of body, is demolished by Plato, who says that
the supreme God promised the gods that they should never be ousted from
their bodies.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But, say they, Porphyry tells us that the soul, in order to
be blessed, must escape connection with every kind of body.
It does not avail, therefore, to say that the future body shall
be incorruptible, if the soul cannot be blessed till delivered
from every kind of body. But in the book above mentioned
I have already sufficiently discussed this. This one thing only
will I repeat,&mdash;let Plato, their master, correct his writings, and
say that their gods, in order to be blessed, must quit their
bodies, or, in other words, die; for he said that they were shut
up in celestial bodies, and that, nevertheless, the God who
made them promised them immortality,&mdash;that is to say, an
eternal tenure of these same bodies, such as was not provided
for them naturally, but only by the further intervention of
His will, that thus they might be assured of felicity. In this
he obviously overturns their assertion that the resurrection
of the body cannot be believed because it is impossible; for,
according to him, when the uncreated God promised immortality
to the created gods, He expressly said that He would
do what was impossible. For Plato tells us that He said,
"As ye have had a beginning, so you cannot be immortal
and incorruptible; yet ye shall not decay, nor shall any fate
destroy you or prove stronger than my will, which more effectually
binds you to immortality than the bond of your nature
keeps you from it." If they who hear these words have, we
do not say understanding, but ears, they cannot doubt that
Plato believed that God promised to the gods He had made
that He would effect an impossibility. For He who says,
"Ye cannot be immortal, but by my will ye shall be immortal,"
what else does He say than this, "I shall make you
what ye cannot be?" The body, therefore, shall be raised
incorruptible, immortal, spiritual, by Him who, according to
Plato, has promised to do that which is impossible. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
then do they still exclaim that this which God has promised,
which the world has believed on God's promise as was predicted,
is an impossibility? For what we say is, that the God
who, even according to Plato, does impossible things, will do
this. It is not, then, necessary to the blessedness of the soul
that it be detached from a body of any kind whatever, but
that it receive an incorruptible body. And in what incorruptible
body will they more suitably rejoice than in that in
which they groaned when it was corruptible? For thus they
shall not feel that dire craving which Virgil, in imitation of
Plato, has ascribed to them when he says that they wish to
return again to their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> They shall not, I say, feel this
desire to return to their bodies, since they shall have those
bodies to which a return was desired, and shall, indeed, be in
such thorough possession of them, that they shall never lose
them even for the briefest moment, nor ever lay them down
in death.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>Of the apparently conflicting opinions of Plato and Porphyry, which would
have conducted them both to the truth if they could have yielded to one
another.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Statements were made by Plato and Porphyry singly, which
if they could have seen their way to hold in common, they
might possibly have become Christians. Plato said that souls
could not exist eternally without bodies; for it was on this
account, he said, that the souls even of wise men must some
time or other return to their bodies. Porphyry, again, said
that the purified soul, when it has returned to the Father, shall
never return to the ills of this world. Consequently, if Plato
had communicated to Porphyry that which he saw to be true,
that souls, though perfectly purified, and belonging to the wise
and righteous, must return to human bodies; and if Porphyry,
again, had imparted to Plato the truth which he saw, that holy
souls shall never return to the miseries of a corruptible body,
so that they should not have each held only his own opinion,
but should both have held both truths, I think they would
have seen that it follows that the souls return to their bodies,
and also that these bodies shall be such as to afford them a
blessed and immortal life. For, according to Plato, even holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
souls shall return to the body; according to Porphyry, holy
souls shall not return to the ills of this world. Let Porphyry
then say with Plato, they shall return to the body; let Plato
say with Porphyry, they shall not return to their old misery:
and they will agree that they return to bodies in which they
shall suffer no more. And this is nothing else than what God
has promised,&mdash;that He will give eternal felicity to souls joined
to their own bodies. For this, I presume, both of them would
readily concede, that if the souls of the saints are to be reunited
to bodies, it shall be to their own bodies, in which they
have endured the miseries of this life, and in which, to escape
these miseries, they served God with piety and fidelity.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>28. <i>What Plato or Labeo, or even Varro, might have contributed to the true
faith of the resurrection, if they had adopted one another's opinions into
one scheme.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some Christians, who have a liking for Plato on account of
his magnificent style and the truths which he now and then
uttered, say that he even held an opinion similar to our own
regarding the resurrection of the dead. Cicero, however, alluding
to this in his <i>Republic</i>, asserts that Plato meant it rather
as a playful fancy than as a reality; for he introduces a man<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>
who had come to life again, and gave a narrative of his experience
in corroboration of the doctrines of Plato. Labeo, too,
says that two men died on one day, and met at a cross-road,
and that, being afterwards ordered to return to their bodies,
they agreed to be friends for life, and were so till they died
again. But the resurrection which these writers instance resembles
that of those persons whom we have ourselves known
to rise again, and who came back indeed to this life, but not
so as never to die again. Marcus Varro, however, in his work
<i>On the Origin of the Roman People</i>, records something more
remarkable; I think his own words should be given. "Certain
astrologers," he says, "have written that men are destined to
a new birth, which the Greeks call <i>palingenesy</i>. This will take
place after four hundred and forty years have elapsed; and then
the same soul and the same body, which were formerly united
in the person, shall again be reunited." This Varro, indeed, or
those nameless astrologers,&mdash;for he does not give us the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
of the men whose statement he cites,&mdash;have affirmed what is
indeed not altogether true; for once the souls have returned to
the bodies they wore, they shall never afterwards leave them.
Yet what they say upsets and demolishes much of that idle
talk of our adversaries about the impossibility of the resurrection.
For those who have been or are of this opinion, have
not thought it possible that bodies which have dissolved into
air, or dust, or ashes, or water, or into the bodies of the beasts
or even of the men that fed on them, should be restored again
to that which they formerly were. And therefore, if Plato
and Porphyry, or rather, if their disciples now living, agree
with us that holy souls shall return to the body, as Plato says,
and that, nevertheless, they shall not return to misery, as Porphyry
maintains,&mdash;if they accept the consequence of these two
propositions which is taught by the Christian faith, that they
shall receive bodies in which they may live eternally without
suffering any misery,&mdash;let them also adopt from Varro the
opinion that they shall return to the same bodies as they were
formerly in, and thus the whole question of the eternal resurrection
of the body shall be resolved out of their own mouths.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the beatific vision.</i></p>

<p>And now let us consider, with such ability as God may
vouchsafe, how the saints shall be employed when they are
clothed in immortal and spiritual bodies, and when the flesh
shall live no longer in a fleshly but a spiritual fashion. And
indeed, to tell the truth, I am at a loss to understand the
nature of that employment, or, shall I rather say, repose and
ease, for it has never come within the range of my bodily
senses. And if I should speak of my mind or understanding,
what is our understanding in comparison of its excellence?
For then shall be that "peace of God which," as the apostle
says, "passeth all understanding,"<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>&mdash;that is to say, all human,
and perhaps all angelic understanding, but certainly not the
divine. That it passeth ours there is no doubt; but if it
passeth that of the angels,&mdash;and he who says "<i>all</i> understanding"
seems to make no exception in their favour,&mdash;then we
must understand him to mean that neither we nor the angels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
can understand, as God understands, the peace which God Himself
enjoys. Doubtless this passeth all understanding but His
own. But as we shall one day be made to participate, according
to our slender capacity, in His peace, both in ourselves,
and with our neighbour, and with God our chief good, in this
respect the angels understand the peace of God in their own
measure, and men too, though now far behind them, whatever
spiritual advance they have made. For we must remember
how great a man he was who said, "We know in part, and
we prophesy in part, until that which is perfect is come;"<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>
and "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to
face."<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Such also is now the vision of the holy angels, who
are also called our angels, because we, being rescued out of
the power of darkness, and receiving the earnest of the Spirit,
are translated into the kingdom of Christ, and already begin
to belong to those angels with whom we shall enjoy that holy
and most delightful city of God of which we have now written
so much. Thus, then, the angels of God are our angels, as
Christ is God's and also ours. They are God's, because they
have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their
fellow-citizens. The Lord Jesus also said, "See that ye despise
not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, That in
heaven their angels do always see the face of my Father which
is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> As, then, they see, so shall we also see; but
not yet do we thus see. Wherefore the apostle uses the words
cited a little ago, "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but
then face to face." This vision is reserved as the reward of
our faith; and of it the Apostle John also says, "When He
shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
is."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> By "the face" of God we are to understand His manifestation,
and not a part of the body similar to that which in
our bodies we call by that name.</p>

<p>And so, when I am asked how the saints shall be employed
in that spiritual body, I do not say what I see, but I say what
I believe, according to that which I read in the psalm, "I believed,
therefore have I spoken."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> I say, then, they shall in
the body see God; but whether they shall see Him by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
of the body, as now we see the sun, moon, stars, sea, earth,
and all that is in it, that is a difficult question. For it is
hard to say that the saints shall then have such bodies that
they shall not be able to shut and open their eyes as they
please; while it is harder still to say that every one who shuts
his eyes shall lose the vision of God. For if the prophet
Elisha, though at a distance, saw his servant Gehazi, who
thought that his wickedness would escape his master's observation
and accepted gifts from Naaman the Syrian, whom the
prophet had cleansed from his foul leprosy, how much more
shall the saints in the spiritual body see all things, not only
though their eyes be shut, but though they themselves be at
a great distance? For then shall be "that which is perfect,"
of which the apostle says, "We know in part, and we prophesy
in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away." Then, that he
may illustrate as well as possible, by a simile, how superior
the future life is to the life now lived, not only by ordinary
men, but even by the foremost of the saints, he says,
"When I was a child, I understood as a child, I spake as a
child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put
away childish things. Now we see through a glass, darkly;
but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall
I know even as also I am known."<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> If, then, even in this
life, in which the prophetic power of remarkable men is no
more worthy to be compared to the vision of the future life
than childhood is to manhood, Elisha, though distant from his
servant, saw him accepting gifts, shall we say that when that
which is perfect is come, and the corruptible body no longer
oppresses the soul, but is incorruptible and offers no impediment
to it, the saints shall need bodily eyes to see, though
Elisha had no need of them to see his servant? For, following
the Septuagint version, these are the prophet's words: "Did not
my heart go with thee, when the man came out of his chariot
to meet thee, and thou tookedst his gifts?"<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> Or, as the presbyter
Jerome rendered it from the Hebrew, "Was not my heart
present when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee?"
The prophet said that he saw this with his heart, miraculously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
aided by God, as no one can doubt. But how much more
abundantly shall the saints enjoy this gift when God shall be
all in all? Nevertheless the bodily eyes also shall have their
office and their place, and shall be used by the spirit through
the spiritual body. For the prophet did not forego the use of
his eyes for seeing what was before them, though he did not
need them to see his absent servant, and though he could have
seen these present objects in spirit, and with his eyes shut, as
he saw things far distant in a place where he himself was not.
Far be it, then, from us to say that in the life to come the
saints shall not see God when their eyes are shut, since they
shall always see Him with the spirit.</p>

<p>But the question arises, whether, when their eyes are open,
they shall see Him with the bodily eye? If the eyes of the
spiritual body have no more power than the eyes which we
now possess, manifestly God cannot be seen with them. They
must be of a very different power if they can look upon that
incorporeal nature which is not contained in any place, but is
all in every place. For though we say that God is in heaven
and on earth, as He Himself says by the prophet, "I fill
heaven and earth,"<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> we do not mean that there is one part of
God in heaven and another part on earth; but He is all in
heaven and all on earth, not at alternate intervals of time,
but both at once, as no bodily nature can be. The eye, then,
shall have a vastly superior power,&mdash;the power not of keen
sight, such as is ascribed to serpents or eagles, for however
keenly these animals see, they can discern nothing but bodily
substances,&mdash;but the power of seeing things incorporeal. Possibly
it was this great power of vision which was temporarily
communicated to the eyes of the holy Job while yet in this
mortal body, when he says to God, "I have heard of Thee by
the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee: wherefore
I abhor myself, and melt away, and count myself dust
and ashes;"<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> although there is no reason why we should not
understand this of the eye of the heart, of which the apostle
says, "Having the eyes of your heart illuminated."<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> But that
God shall be seen with these eyes no Christian doubts who
believingly accepts what our God and Master says, "Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> But whether
in the future life God shall also be seen with the bodily eye,
this is now our question.</p>

<p>The expression of Scripture, "And all flesh shall see the
salvation of God,"<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> may without difficulty be understood as
if it were said, "And every man shall see the Christ of God."
And He certainly was seen in the body, and shall be seen in
the body when He judges quick and dead. And that Christ
is the salvation of God, many other passages of Scripture witness,
but especially the words of the venerable Simeon, who,
when he had received into his hands the infant Christ, said,
"Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to
Thy word: for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation."<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> As for
the words of the above-mentioned Job, as they are found in
the Hebrew manuscripts, "And in my flesh I shall see God,"<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>
no doubt they were a prophecy of the resurrection of the
flesh; yet he does not say "<i>by</i> the flesh." And indeed, if he
had said this, it would still be possible that Christ was meant
by "God;" for Christ shall be seen by the flesh in the flesh.
But even understanding it of God, it is only equivalent to
saying, I shall be in the flesh when I see God. Then the
apostle's expression, "face to face,"<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> does not oblige us to
believe that we shall see God by the bodily face in which are
the eyes of the body, for we shall see Him without intermission
in spirit. And if the apostle had not referred to the
face of the inner man, he would not have said, "But we, with
unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as
by the Spirit of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> In the same sense we understand
what the Psalmist sings, "Draw near unto Him, and be
enlightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed."<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> For it is
by faith we draw near to God, and faith is an act of the spirit,
not of the body. But as we do not know what degree of perfection
the spiritual body shall attain,&mdash;for here we speak of a
matter of which we have no experience, and upon which the
authority of Scripture does not definitely pronounce,&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
necessary that the words of the Book of Wisdom be illustrated
in us: "The thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our forecastings
uncertain."<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<p>For if that reasoning of the philosophers, by which they
attempt to make out that intelligible or mental objects are so
seen by the mind, and sensible or bodily objects so seen by the
body, that the former cannot be discerned by the mind through
the body, nor the latter by the mind itself without the body,&mdash;if
this reasoning were trustworthy, then it would certainly
follow that God could not be seen by the eye even of a
spiritual body. But this reasoning is exploded both by true
reason and by prophetic authority. For who is so little acquainted
with the truth as to say that God has no cognisance
of sensible objects? Has He therefore a body, the eyes
of which give Him this knowledge? Moreover, what we
have just been relating of the prophet Elisha, does this not
sufficiently show that bodily things can be discerned by the
spirit without the help of the body? For when that servant
received the gifts, certainly this was a bodily or material
transaction, yet the prophet saw it not by the body, but by
the spirit. As, therefore, it is agreed that bodies are seen by
the spirit, what if the power of the spiritual body shall be so
great that spirit also is seen by the body? For God is a
spirit. Besides, each man recognises his own life&mdash;that life
by which he now lives in the body, and which vivifies these
earthly members and causes them to grow&mdash;by an interior
sense, and not by his bodily eye; but the life of other men,
though it is invisible, he sees with the bodily eye. For how do
we distinguish between living and dead bodies, except by seeing
at once both the body and the life which we cannot see save
by the eye? But a life without a body we cannot see thus.</p>

<p>Wherefore it may very well be, and it is thoroughly credible,
that we shall in the future world see the material forms
of the new heavens and the new earth in such a way that we
shall most distinctly recognise God everywhere present and
governing all things, material as well as spiritual, and shall
see Him, not as now we understand the invisible things of
God, by the things which are made,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> and see Him darkly, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
in a mirror, and in part, and rather by faith than by bodily
vision of material appearances, but by means of the bodies we
shall wear and which we shall see wherever we turn our eyes.
As we do not believe, but see that the living men around us
who are exercising vital functions are alive, though we cannot
see their life without their bodies, but see it most distinctly by
means of their bodies, so, wherever we shall look with those
spiritual eyes of our future bodies, we shall then, too, by
means of bodily substances behold God, though a spirit, ruling
all things. Either, therefore, the eyes shall possess some
quality similar to that of the mind, by which they may be
able to discern spiritual things, and among these God,&mdash;a
supposition for which it is difficult or even impossible to find
any support in Scripture,&mdash;or, which is more easy to comprehend,
God will be so known by us, and shall be so much before
us, that we shall see Him by the spirit in ourselves, in one
another, in Himself, in the new heavens and the new earth, in
every created thing which shall then exist; and also by the
body we shall see Him in every body which the keen vision
of the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. Our thoughts
also shall be visible to all, for then shall be fulfilled the words
of the apostle, "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord
come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
and will make manifest the thoughts of the heart, and
then shall every one have praise of God."<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

the great Artificer, there shall be the enjoyment of a beauty
which appeals to the reason. What power of movement such
bodies shall possess, I have not the audacity rashly to define,
as I have not the ability to conceive. Nevertheless I will say
that in any case, both in motion and at rest, they shall be,
as in their appearance, seemly; for into that state nothing
which is unseemly shall be admitted. One thing is certain,
the body shall forthwith be wherever the spirit wills, and the
spirit shall will nothing which is unbecoming either to the
spirit or to the body. True honour shall be there, for it shall
be denied to none who is worthy, nor yielded to any unworthy;
neither shall any unworthy person so much as sue for it, for
none but the worthy shall be there. True peace shall be
there, where no one shall suffer opposition either from himself
or any other. God Himself, who is the Author of virtue,
shall there be its reward; for, as there is nothing greater or
better, He has promised Himself. What else was meant by
His word through the prophet, "I will be your God, and ye
shall be my people,"<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> than, I shall be their satisfaction, I shall
be all that men honourably desire,&mdash;life, and health, and nourishment,
and plenty, and glory, and honour, and peace, and all
good things? This, too, is the right interpretation of the saying
of the apostle, "That God may be all in all."<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> He shall be
the end of our desires who shall be seen without end, loved
without cloy, praised without weariness. This outgoing of
affection, this employment, shall certainly be, like eternal life
itself, common to all.</p>

<p>But who can conceive, not to say describe, what degrees of
honour and glory shall be awarded to the various degrees of
merit? Yet it cannot be doubted that there shall be degrees.
And in that blessed city there shall be this great blessing, that
no inferior shall envy any superior, as now the archangels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
not envied by the angels, because no one will wish to be what
he has not received, though bound in strictest concord with
him who has received; as in the body the finger does not seek
to be the eye, though both members are harmoniously included
in the complete structure of the body. And thus, along with
his gift, greater or less, each shall receive this further gift of
contentment to desire no more than he has.</p>

<p>Neither are we to suppose that because sin shall have no
power to delight them, free will must be withdrawn. It will,
on the contrary, be all the more truly free, because set free
from delight in sinning to take unfailing delight in not sinning.
For the first freedom of will which man received when he was
created upright consisted in an ability not to sin, but also in
an ability to sin; whereas this last freedom of will shall be
superior, inasmuch as it shall not be able to sin. This, indeed,
shall not be a natural ability, but the gift of God. For it is
one thing to be God, another thing to be a partaker of God.
God by nature cannot sin, but the partaker of God receives
this inability from God. And in this divine gift there was to
be observed this gradation, that man should first receive a free
will by which he was able not to sin, and at last a free will by
which he was not able to sin,&mdash;the former being adapted to the
acquiring of merit, the latter to the enjoying of the reward.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
But the nature thus constituted, having sinned when it had
the ability to do so, it is by a more abundant grace that it is
delivered so as to reach that freedom in which it cannot sin.
For as the first immortality which Adam lost by sinning consisted
in his being able not to die, while the last shall consist
in his not being able to die; so the first free will consisted in
his being able not to sin, the last in his not being able to sin.
And thus piety and justice shall be as indefeasible as happiness.
For certainly by sinning we lost both piety and happiness;
but when we lost happiness, we did not lose the love of
it. Are we to say that God Himself is not free because He
cannot sin? In that city, then, there shall be free will, one
in all the citizens, and indivisible in each, delivered from all
ill, Filled with all good, enjoying indefeasibly the delights of
eternal joys, oblivious of sins, oblivious of sufferings, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
not so oblivious of its deliverance as to be ungrateful to its
Deliverer.</p>

<p>The soul, then, shall have an intellectual remembrance of its
past ills; but, so far as regards sensible experience, they shall
be quite forgotten. For a skilful physician knows, indeed, professionally
almost all diseases; but experimentally he is ignorant
of a great number which he himself has never suffered
from. As, therefore, there are two ways of knowing evil
things,&mdash;one by mental insight, the other by sensible experience,
for it is one thing to understand all vices by the wisdom of a
cultivated mind, another to understand them by the foolishness
of an abandoned life,&mdash;so also there are two ways of forgetting
evils. For a well-instructed and learned man forgets them one
way, and he who has experimentally suffered from them forgets
them another,&mdash;the former by neglecting what he has learned,
the latter by escaping what he has suffered. And in this
latter way the saints shall forget their past ills, for they shall
have so thoroughly escaped them all, that they shall be quite
blotted out of their experience. But their intellectual knowledge,
which shall be great, shall keep them acquainted not
only with their own past woes, but with the eternal sufferings
of the lost. For if they were not to know that they had been
miserable, how could they, as the Psalmist says, for ever sing
the mercies of God? Certainly that city shall have no greater
joy than the celebration of the grace of Christ, who redeemed
us by His blood. There shall be accomplished the words of
the psalm, "Be still, and know that I am God."<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> There shall
be the great Sabbath which has no evening, which God celebrated
among His first works, as it is written, "And God
rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had
made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it;
because that in it He had rested from all His work which God
began to make."<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> For we shall ourselves be the seventh day,
when we shall be filled and replenished with God's blessing
and sanctification. There shall we be still, and know that He
is God; that He is that which we ourselves aspired to be
when we fell away from Him, and listened to the voice of the
seducer, "Ye shall be as gods,"<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> and so abandoned God, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
would have made us as gods, not by deserting Him, but by
participating in Him. For without Him what have we accomplished,
save to perish in His anger? But when we are
restored by Him, and perfected with greater grace, we shall
have eternal leisure to see that He is God, for we shall be full
of Him when He shall be all in all. For even our good works,
when they are understood to be rather His than ours, are
imputed to us that we may enjoy this Sabbath rest. For
if we attribute them to ourselves, they shall be servile; for
it is said of the Sabbath, "Ye shall do no servile work in
it."<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Wherefore also it is said by Ezekiel the prophet, "And
I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them,
that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them."<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>
This knowledge shall be perfected when we shall be perfectly
at rest, and shall perfectly know that He is God.</p>

<p>This Sabbath shall appear still more clearly if we count the
ages as days, in accordance with the periods of time defined
in Scripture, for that period will be found to be the seventh.
The first age, as the first day, extends from Adam to the
deluge; the second from the deluge to Abraham, equalling the
first, not in length of time, but in the number of generations,
there being ten in each. From Abraham to the advent of
Christ there are, as the evangelist Matthew calculates, three
periods, in each of which are fourteen generations,&mdash;one period
from Abraham to David, a second from David to the captivity,
a third from the captivity to the birth of Christ in the flesh.
There are thus five ages in all. The sixth is now passing, and
cannot be measured by any number of generations, as it has
been said, "It is not for you to know the times, which the
Father hath put in His own power."<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> After this period God
shall rest as on the seventh day, when He shall give us (who
shall be the seventh day) rest in Himself. But there is not now
space to treat of these ages; suffice it to say that the seventh
shall be our Sabbath, which shall be brought to a close, not
by an evening, but by the Lord's day, as an eighth and eternal
day, consecrated by the resurrection of Christ, and prefiguring
the eternal repose not only of the spirit, but also of the body.
There we shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
This is what shall be in the end without end. For what other
end do we propose to ourselves than to attain to the kingdom
of which there is no end?</p>

<p>I think I have now, by God's help, discharged my obligation
in writing this large work. Let those who think I have said
too little, or those who think I have said too much, forgive
me; and let those who think I have said just enough join me
in giving thanks to God. Amen.</p>

<h3>A COLLECTION OF ALL THE WORKS OF THE FATHERS OF THE

<hr class="tb" />


<p>Messrs. Clark are now happy to announce the near completion of this
Series. It has been received with marked approval by all sections of the
Christian Church in this country and in the United States, as supplying what
has long been felt to be a want, and also on account of the impartiality, learning,
and care with which Editors and Translators have executed a very difficult
task.</p>

<p>The whole Series will be completed in Twenty-four Volumes, of which
Eighteen are ready, and the remaining Six will be published in the course of
this year.</p>

<p>Each Work is supplied with a good and full Index; but, to add to the value
of the completed Series, an Index Volume is preparing for the whole Series,
which will be sold separately to those who may desire it, at a moderate price;
and the complete Series (exclusive of General Index), in Twenty-four Volumes,
will cost Six Guineas.</p>

<p>The Subscription for 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th Years is now due&mdash;£5, 5s.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-1em">

<p><i>The Subscription to the Series is at the rate of</i> 21<i>s. for Four Volumes when paid
in advance</i> (<i>or</i> 24<i>s. when not so paid</i>), <i>and</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d. each Volume to Non-Subscribers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Publishers, however, do not bind themselves to <i>continue</i> to supply the
complete Series at this rate.</p>

<p>Single Years cannot be had separately, with the exception of current year,
unless to complete sets, but <i>any Volume</i> may be had separately, price 10s. 6d.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Homilies of Origen are not included in the Series, as the Publishers
have received no encouragement to have them translated.</p>

<i>Confessions</i>, ix. 16. See also <i>Serm.</i> 286, and Ambrose, <i>Ep.</i>. 22. A translation
of this epistle in full is given in Isaac Taylor's <i>Ancient Christianity</i>, ii. 242,
where this miracle is taken as a specimen of the so-called miracles of that age,
and submitted to a detailed examination. The result arrived at will be gathered
from the following sentence: "In the Nicene Church, so lax were the notions
of common morality, and in so feeble a manner did the fear of God influence the
conduct of leading men, that, on occasions when the Church was to be served,
and her assailants to be confounded, they did not scruple to take upon themselves
the contrivance and execution of the most degrading impostures."&mdash;P. 270.
It is to be observed, however, that Augustine was, at least in this instance, one
of the deceived.</p></div>
